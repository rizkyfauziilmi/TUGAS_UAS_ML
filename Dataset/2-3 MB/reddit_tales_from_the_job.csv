I'd say there are two obvious responses - either tell him or pay him 

Depending on how he responds, they may need to contact medical personnel to have him evaluated for his own safety, call police if he becomes violent, or wave in a friendly manner when he politely leaves.",2020-03-20 21:10:52

Getting tired of the politics at this place I work at.,22,da2n2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/da2n2q/getting_tired_of_the_politics_at_this_place_i/,19,1569600826.0,"The current and last place I worked at allowed political talk. It's the nature of the industry I work in and it's generally considered to be bad form to shut people down, it can burn bridges. 

The last place it was fine. I worked with people around my age, people with regular af political views, people who have rational discussions. No issue.

Where I work now it's stereotypical republicans who are cartoon levels of republican. Like the republican that liberals make fun of on TV. Boomers as well. Stupid, believe everything they read online, and all ""their"" opinions do not deviate AT ALL from what you think far-right republicans believe if you were to watch some SNL interpretation of them. 

Aside the usual conspiracy theorist bunk, which doesn't bother me and is funny to me, just imagine you are trying to come up with some republican cartoon character for a comedy central show. That is them. Perpetually offended like the Veteran Justice Warrior on a Terminal Lance comic. 

It wouldn't be bad if this wasn't EVERY FUCKING DAY. 

So just for today here's what they are talking about, and it's only 1 hour in.

Starts out with this dude talking about how black panthers are a terrorist organization and need to be labeled as such and they need to be killed, arrested, etc. 

After that discussion he started talking about Iran. This dude said that ""these countries"" will never modernize. This is how they are and they will always be this way and the way he went on sounded racist af. I brought up examples to contradict this, like Germany before the German Empire, then WW2 and after that, but still in denial. He said they always were an oppressive dictatorship and always will be, then implied ""that's how these people are"". The discussion then went to other arab and then african countries like the Congo.

That's when the UN came out. Nothing to see here aside the typical Alex Jones or John Bolton shit. 

When I say these people repeat shit like mantra with NO deviation that's it. Far-right conservative politics is the bible for these losers. Yesterday Bush came up and while they were doing their ritual praying to St. Jr. I brought up all the shit trump said about him. Broke their brains. You could see them mentally blue screen. The reply to that was ""that's just how he is"" in the end. What's funny is they bring up how Iraq was a mistake and all that, because Trump said so, I brought it up then. ""Well now we know, Bush was still a good president"". But that is minor.

The next was another bi-daily ritual, they had to talk about the police and how ""liberals"" and Kaepernick are DIRECTLY CAUSING police murders. ""HE IS RESPONSIBLE!"".

Next came up that someone on Nellis AFB was selling cocaine and using the profits to arm illegal aliens. One guy said ""That guy's name was Ramirez"".... ""Of course"" is the reply. 

Now I would fight these people more but 1 of the 2 gets violently angry and hold ridiculous insane grudges, which is why his politics make sense. He's also married to a liberal and he rants about her views daily in a way that I think divorce is coming. 

Aside today, just one hour in, yesterday you had this Jane Fonda talk bringing up conspiracies that have been debunked with her. Then they talk about Kavenaugh saying ""it was 35 years ago"" like we shouldn't car. I said well isn't Jane Fonda's thing 50 years ago? You would think I said the n-word or some shit with how offended this dude got. 

The next topic that came up today is Irish Slavery. Now I have a college degree with a minor in history. I specifically focused on southeast asian history and europeon history. There is no such thing as Irish slavery. It is indentured servitude and penal colonies. If you had kids they were born free, they were also white obviously. You also could work it off and then become free. This guy says no, it's literal slavery. Two of my ancestors were slaves and he, once again, has this ""i am offended"" tone to his voice. Literally this guy was brainwashed into being a victim of oppression by the media and the internet, it's insane. He said ""well blacks have been only free for 70 years"" and then said ""well I guess the 60s and 70s don't count but they've had full rights with no government oppressiveness since the 80s. I was like, then why bring this irish slavery up if you believe that? They started saying ""you of all people should know"" since I do have a lot of historical knowledge, and they know this. To appease them I brought up serfdom and said if they want to argue that topic they should bring that up instead of stuff like irish slavery. They claimed I need to research irish slavery, I HAVE and know it's BS. They moved the conversation on.

Who knows what they will discuss next. I've tried to ignore them today and I know more topics came up but it's so hard to ignore. When I hear retarded shit of lies or something I KNOW is historically false I can only take it for so long. 

Any other topic that comes up is typical incel, racial, or alt-right nonsense. Think about anything along those lines and so far since i've worked here i've heard it. And I am not ""sensitive"" as well. When I say ""racist"" i'm talking about them actually being racist, not nuanced or borderline topics. Real actual racism, like saying a people, Iranians, are incapable of having a civilized society and they never will like I mentioned here. This one dude also SOMEHOW has weird rivalries with all the non-white people we work with. I've heard so much alt-right racial talk from this dude it's ridiculous. He's literally a cartoon. 

I wish politics would stop coming up here. I don't mind talking politics and history but listening to retards and fascists talk about it is annoying af and pointless. Anything I can say and any evidence i could give will not even shift their views one iota so it is totally pointless. They just want a rant audience. They want to be offended with somebody. You try to calm them down or deflate it even in the slightest you are basically tossing dynamite. 

If I just didn't get a good raise and this wasn't the best place I ever worked for management wise I would bring this shit up. But this is the downside of working for a company that has had employees that have worked here for 35 years. They have employees this long for a reason, it's an old-style workplace, but then you get these losers who at a place that routinely moved people around wouldn't be working. This is an IT job and there are people stuck even 30 years behind. 

Sorry I had to rant somewhere, I can barely handle this shit. I wish I had someone to talk to so I don't explode at work. I am not big into politics and am more into history, NEVER been annoyed by peoples politics before and I used to be an American Legion member listening to their shit and my last job had someone with not as ridiculous and brainwashed views as these people had who i'm still friends with and even they think these people are lunatics.",2019-09-27 19:13:46
Savage IT coworker destroys an angry inventory lady.,81,bx5skv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bx5skv/savage_it_coworker_destroys_an_angry_inventory/,0,1559758221.0,"I used to work on an Air Force contract in a flying squadron, we had some awesome and TERRIBLE workers there. One awesome worker was this woman who was also a total savage. Extremely great worker but who didn't tolerate any shit what so ever from anyone and was totally fearless of who she said it to. She ripped everyone at some point. One shitty worker was this older lady who also had the traits of not giving a fuck, but instead was just a lazy asshole.

Lazy asshole worked in inventory. She would whistle and hum to music literally all day in our open office and sing, for hours. She would spray this like potpourri smell everywhere that bothered several people and would refuse to stop when asked. We had two buildings, with two inventory people, and she decided to run this building the way she wanted when she was the lower ranked person and because of that we always had to ask her where things were. The other building literally you look it up in the database and you didn't even have to talk to the guy. This woman was also a COMPLETE dick to ""the customers"" aka the Airmen and she would always disregard the dress code and generally any office rules. Take shit from the fridge. Make jalapeno popcorn in the microwave filling the room with blinding toxic gas. All things she was told not to do, and more, but she didn't gaf.

Our dress code was polo shirt, nice jeans or khaki, and work shoes. She would show up in a sparkly kitty shirt, skinny and torn jeans, and slip on shoes. At this point I should note shes blazian, how she referred to herself. It becomes important.

After a while of her being annoying they gave her an office to herself, really a large janitors closest where our IT stuff was. When you walked in it was like you were being mustard gassed from the spray she used, everything was disorganized, and you would have her talk shit to you about things you never even did. Any questions you had to shout at her because she had earbuds in full blast ofc.

One day a kid and A1C, had to be 18, straight out of tech school walks up to her in the hallway and asks where some janitor supplies are. She FLIPS THE FUCK OUT about how he's racist assuming shes a janitor because shes not white. She did this once before when she was new to a coworker. Probably because she shows up dressing like the ladies we have come in to clean up more than anything. The good savage hears this, comes out of her office to say... angrily ""He wouldn't think you were a janitor if you didn't dress like one.""

After this she followed the dress code.",2019-06-05 21:10:21

Even when they can’t admit it, that’s understandable up to appoint as long as they can calmly agree to disagree without being aggressive. This guy stands by all of his wrongness so completely and thinks so highly of himself. He chases me around the office to chat because he has no friends and doesn’t know that it’s because he’s awful.
Our boss is a mutual friend, a really sweet and optimistic guy who sees the best in everybody, and I hate to think that my boss will get a bad reputation because of my coworkers personality.
Also, this is kind of a personal complaint, but he ends a lot of his sentences with yeah but pronounces it yuh, which is so annoying.

Can I tell them “No”?,46,pqpjtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/pqpjtq/can_i_tell_them_no/,7,1631982420.0,"My spouse & I run a nonprofit which, among other things, operates a seasonal outdoor Guided service in the tourism sector. We also have services that can be booked online, but the Guided option can only be booked through me via phone or email. Additionally, we donate a lot of free Guided Trip gift certificates to local fundraisers, and honestly, not many get redeemed. The few that do schedule their trip, never return and never spend any actual money with us. Which is fine, we don’t donate to make money, but it would also be nice to gain a customer or 2 in return for all of our giveaways, but that’s not my point. 

Also to note, summer of 2020 during the pandemic was our busiest season ever because everyone wanted to be outside. 2021 was ok, but not as good as last year. 

Last week, Sept. 11, we received an email asking to book one of these Guided certificates before it expires on Sept. 15. Our season officially ends tomorrow, Sept. 19. Somehow I missed this email from last weekend. So last night we got a text from this same person stating that they have been trying to book this and asking if we will still accept it even though it expired a few days ago. I apologized for missing their email and ask for their info so I can look up the request and see how many emails & when I missed them (assuming I missed it at this point, since I hadn’t actually seen the email yet). So I find the email. They also texted a pic of the certificate. This certificate was issued in Aug. 2019. We give all service certificates 2 full summer seasons before they expire. This customer waited 2+ full years to inquire about scheduling a free trip that expired 4 days after their first inquiry. 

Had they reached out earlier and asked to extend it because of the pandemic, I would have happily added another year. But instead, they waited 735ish days and said they’ve “been trying to schedule” which was obviously exaggerated and now I want to tell them “No, sorry, you waited too long”. I don’t think one request 2 years later counts as “been trying”.

"Package driver gets stuck on property, cops get involved",70,pkc2wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/pkc2wb/package_driver_gets_stuck_on_property_cops_get/,2,1631112846.0,"Before I start, I'm fairly new to Reddit and don't know most of the formatting or best places to post this so sorry if this belongs somewhere else. Also this happened a few weeks ago so my memory is a bit spotty on the dialogue.

For context, I work for a subcontractor who has a contract with a major package delivery company and  they have us use their vans to drive around and deliver stuff to people. I've been doing this for about half a year now and this is my first time having a problem on the road.   


So, I'm working in a brand new area and its a very rural place. Woods all around and the houses are like half a mile apart. This particular property is on a shared driveway with 3 other homes. It was at the front of the driveway with a creek separating the main  road from their front yard. Now the important thing about this front yard is that its in a depression. Its about a foot below the driveway that runs along side it. I'm pulling my way out of the main driveway to do a 3-point turn to leave, when my front tire goes over the edge. I'm like 'well crap' and try to pull myself out. I have about half a truck full still left so no joy there. So my only bet now is to go onto the lawn and try and run my way out. I hop out of the truck and tell the residents, who are cool with it. This isn't even the 5th time this has happened and just want my dispatcher's number so they can ask about any damage to the lawn from this. I call dispatch and they are understanding so we give it a shot. Trouble is the grass is completely soaked and i cant get more that 10mph out of it. So we reluctantly call a tow truck.   


Now here's where things really start going down hill. Unbeknownst to me at the time, AAA does not cover commercial vehicles. I was unaware of that, and apparently so were my bosses. According to them AAA covered them once before so they were under the impression it would cover this too. Now another thing you should know about me is that I have Asbergers, which means I don't handle conflict very well and tend to get overstimulated when it happens. So the tow guy shows up and hooks me up with some chains. When he gets the back tires onto the pavement, he stops then tells me AAA wont cover this so I have to pay him. I tell him that I cant pay as I don't have any way of paying him (I leave all my cards in my glove box)  and tell him that's something he has to talk to my boss about. I call him and tell him I'm not out of the yard yet and the guy is saying I need to pay him. He says to get him on the phone after I'm out of the yard. Once we're out I hand him the phone and the two talk. I'm not sure what's said but it gets into a shouting match and the guy says he's demanding double and in cash for being yelled at. I get the phone back and my manager says not to exit the van till they get there with the cash. I tell the tow guy this and he gets pissed, saying he's going to call the cops. True to his threat, he does. Now remember what I said about confrontation? When the cop arrives, he's fairly aggressive out of the gate, demanding I roll down the window and get out of the truck. I, being a scared idiot at the time, just roll down the window to try explaining to him why I cant get out. He does threaten to break the window to get me out but I pass the phone to him with my boss and it seems to de-escalate from there. I'm still in the truck about an hour later when my bosses finally get there. After that I'm not exactly sure what happened. I was in a state of panic at the time, wondering if I'm going to be charged or something or lose my job. Thankfully the guy's partner is a lot more understanding about what happened and what my condition was. After chugging a couple bottles of water I finally calmed down. I started following what was going on in bits and pieces, part of the problem being that the tow guy was supposed to have been recalled before getting here and that since the guy towed me out that he had rendered service. My bosses were talking about the recall and saying I told them I wasn't out of the ditch. I quickly corrected them though that i was halfway out so I was still in the ditch when they called me. Thankfully they seemed to get it and after that, the guy in the truck went off and I was driven back to the depot. 

  
Thankfully my bosses are great and completely understood that what happened wasn't my fault. I did everything I was told and the problem was between them and the tow guy so there were no repercussions. They think that the guy was being so belligerent because he could see what packaging company i was delivering for, so if he impounded it, he would get an extra payout. I did get paid for the extra time i was on the road as well so I managed to get an extra $50 out of it too. So hey, silver linings.",2021-09-08 17:54:06
Aquarium Shenanigans: Doctor Fish,29,pjiaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/pjiaut/aquarium_shenanigans_doctor_fish/,2,1631000001.0,"For additional context about my job, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/pjhqrc/aquarium_shenanigans_aviaries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

DO NOT USE ANY OF MY POSTS FOR ANY VIDEOS, BLOGS, OR OTHER EXTERNAL SITES. 
Along with all the usual reasons, I don’t need my employers finding me out. 

Disclaimers: I’m on mobile, I’m terrible at english, and I’m new to this subreddit so please correct me if there’s a specific formatting here

So sometimes, usually just one day out of the week, I work at our doctor fish encounter. 

Essentially, I collect money to let people stick their hands or feet in a fish tank. My employers would love me to dress that up more in a pretty way, but that’s basically what it is. 

So these doctor fish eat dead skin off your hands or feet, leaving them softer, etc. etc. Also known as spa fish or nibble fish. Idk I’m not at work, can’t be bothered, look it up. 

So below is just a collection of things people do/say that makes me want to throw them in the stingray pool.

1. Watch your god damn children

I have two rules for encounters involving hands. Don’t swish your hands around, and DON’T GRAB THE FISH.

Unfortunately, people bring their 2-6 year olds, waltzing up to my booth then leaving them unattended. I am not a babysitter and I am not technically allowed to forcefully remove your children’s hands from the water. 

These children will swish their hands around like they’re stirring a pot, pick up fish out of the water, chase the fish with their hands, and full on grab and squeeze our fish. Also, I’ve seen them dip their hands in the water and pop them straight into their mouths, tho that’s not as much my problem as it is yours. 

Some of these children are punting size. Don’t test my patience. I have no write ups yet, one will not get me fired and I am inches away from planting a child ass-up in a tank across the room. 

Watch your child please, or teach them to respect the rules and the lives of my fish. 

2. Wash your nasty ass feet

Our fish are not there to “clean” your feet, and you saying “damn my feet are so nasty these fish are gonna be full by the time I leave” or “I haven’t washed my feet in a week, these fish are gonna be eating good” does not make me feel any better about letting you put them in the tank. Even if it’s a joke, it’s tactless. 

I have actually had situations where people have visible athletes foot and other nasty stuff going on there, but I am not allowed to turn people down. 

Not to worry though, we have as much anti-fungal and antibacterial in the water as we physically can without harming our fish and we change the water super frequently. But if you see the person ahead of you with some gross feet, maybe come back in half an hour so the chemicals have a chance to work. 

And most importantly, if you have an injury, even a scabbed over one, remember that this encounter is not mandatory. 

Not only is that disgusting for the fish, you, and other people, putting an open wound into any kind of water that’s not safe for drinking is a bad idea. And fish water is most definitely not safe for drinking. 

3. I will not argue with you

I regularly get people getting up in my face about how unsanitary and unsafe the encounter is and how it’s abusing the fish. And of course they get all this from reading articles about spas on the internet that do have unsafe, unsanitary, abusive conditions. 

We are not a spa, we follow federal guidelines for every single enclosure and encounter in the aquarium. I can get a manager for you if you really want to fight. 

But yelling at a minimum wage worker at an aquarium in front of dozens of children is not the civil way to use your newfound knowledge. 

If you want to engage in a polite conversation in which you are willing to let me educate you about this topic that I clearly know more on than you (usually. I admit there are exceptions) then by all means, let’s. Otherwise, stfu, thanks.

This goes for any employee in the entire aquarium at any encounter. Just treat us all with basic human decency. Most of us aren’t paid enough to put up with your BS. 

Thanks for reading this far! I will try to post frequently, so keep an eye out. 

TLDR: I rant about dumb things people do/say at the doctor fish encounter at my work and how I feel about them.",2021-09-07 10:33:21

For context: I work at an aquarium, and despite the label, we have all sorts of animals. The novelty of this particular aquarium is that you can interact with almost everything, mainly by petting or feeding. I work mainly at two different exhibits at the moment. 

I work in the indoor aviaries and at our doctor fish station. 
The former you go in and feed the birds, basically, and the latter you stick your feet or hands in the water and let the fish eat your dead skin.

Okay, so this will be a collection of little anecdotes and frequently occurring pet peeves from my time working since I don’t get a lot of big things happening. 

This post is about the aviaries. You can find the post about doctor fish [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/pjiaut/aquarium_shenanigans_doctor_fish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  

Tales from the aviaries:

1. “What do they taste like?” 

I have had several “funny” dads ask me this. Including one man who wouldn’t stop asking me this and making jokes about it. 

First of all, that’s disgusting. I do not know what our toucan or parakeets or lorikeets TASTE like, and this question guarantees I will be looking for reasons to kick you out of my exhibit so you better be on your best behavior. 

Second, I have hand raised some of our birds from tiny featherless nut sacks into the beautiful birds they are today. You are essentially talking about eating my children. Fuck you. 

And finally, what is wrong with you. Not a question, a statement. Just because we let you interact with our animals as opposed to seeing them from the other side of a wall of glass doesn’t mean you should make morbid jokes about barbecuing them.

2. “What makes you think this enclosure is big enough?” / “It’s filthy in here”

This isn’t quite as bad as the bird-b-q jokes, because at least you’re thinking about the birds’ best interest(?) but this usually comes from the haughtiest, huffiest Karens who have obviously never owned or even met a bird in their lives. Plus it’s usually asked as accusingly as possible. 

The enclosure is big enough. I promise. Don’t believe me? Look at the entire chunk of the enclosure that goes virtually unused. Look at the birds that are literally smaller than your hand flying and playing 10 feet+ above you. Look at the whole ass door that goes outside so they have even more space to play in. Or better yet, use the phone you almost certainly have on you and look up how much space captive birds need. 

These are, I can personally guarantee, the same people who get birds as a “starter pet” for their 6 year old and keep them in a 1x1x2 cage 24/7. 

As far as cleanliness goes: birds poop. Constantly. Which is something you would know if you’ve owned a bird. Or a car. Small birds poop constantly because they basically eat constantly. I could scrub the whole place clean seconds before you walk in and I guarantee you’ll step in bird poop on your way to the bench. That’s why we have a mat that you wipe your feet on on the way out soaked with (non toxic, but like don’t lick the mat) chemicals designed to break that down. 

Despite all this, it’s still rude to tell the person that cleans three different bird enclosures four times a day that the space is “filthy”

And to keep this post from getting too too long, just one more story, and this ones a more fun one

3. “What’s that bird doing?” 

This one is a little more in a story format, but for context, this happened in our lorikeet enclosure which shares a wall with our toucan enclosure. Toucans eat small birds in the wild. Lorikeets are fairly small, (a lot of what I say about the birds beyond this point is speculation, I may be wrong, feel free to offer alternate explanations) but she’s more focused on our budgies that are in the enclosure on the opposite side. 

As usual, I’m doing an encounter with the lorikeets, and the loris are mobbing me because I am food bringer. I am handing food cups out to guests, deafened by lori chirps. Oddly enough, the loris are not hopping over from me to guests. 

I manually move one off my shoulder onto a visitor’s lap, and when I finally regain hearing in that one ear, I realize why the loris are clinging to me (or the far wall, sadly I don’t have enough natural perches on me to hold all 11 of our loris). 

Our toucan is going positively wild. She’s chirping out this car alarm-esque alarm call that’s put the loris on edge. The alarm call warns of danger on the ground. 

She’s wanting to eat the budgies next door, and this call works to get the budgies off the ground towards her where she’s perched at the top of the enclosure. Luckily there’s a net wall there, so I’m not quite sure she’s figured out her next step yet. 

The loris have a few more brain cells than the budgies and have witnessed toucan war crimes in the past, so reasonably, this alarm call does not immediately send them fluttering up towards the toucan. 

All this context to say that the small child of the group I was assisting asked “what’s the bird doing, mom?” while pointing at the toucan. 

The mother looked expectantly towards me, and I wasn’t about to give her a straight answer (“hunting”) so I just went

“Uhhh… she’s scared of birds” which is NOT what I meant to say. 

Not my finest moment.

Taco Bell Crackhead,51,p5gq88,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/p5gq88/taco_bell_crackhead/,1,1629122712.0,"So I used to work at Taco Bell and one time we had the craziest customer. We were having a promotion so we got tons of orders from inside, the drive thru, and UberEats. We got so many orders that the system shut down and we couldn’t take any payments. This lady comes in saying that she needs three tacos to feed her son’s little league football team (idk how 3 tacos feeds a whole team)And we tell her that we aren’t able to take any orders. She quickly becomes angry so we offered to give her the tacos for free. She gets personally offended that we offered her free food and starts screaming that she wants to pay for her tacos. My manager goes over to try to deescalate the situation and the lady grabs my manager’s hair and yanks her over the counter. A male coworker goes to forcibly drag the lady out of the store and in response she takes a bite out of his arm. In the scuffle she also manages to break the door so it wasnt able to lock.

When my coworker comes back in there is a chunk missing from his arm (he now has permanent nerve damage). When the cops come she tries to lie and say that my EXTREMELY flamboyant and obviously gay coworker sexually assaulted her. The cops view our camera footage and arrest her. As she is getting arrested she starts banging her head on the hood of the cop car like a lunatic. They get her in the cop car and somehow she got out and was running down the street. She didn’t get very far though and she got taken in to the precinct.

By then, the ladies cousin comes in since she had called her cousin before the cops came. Her cousin hears me tell the cop that the lady had called me a “ni***r” and her cousin gets mad since her husband and kids are black. The cousin says she doesn’t like racists and turns to the cops and go “sir she takes drugs. she has pounds of coke in her basement right now,” and proceeds to tell them the address. I checked the news months later and she got charged for 2 counts of assault, drug possession, and destruction of private property. Still the craziest thing that i’ve witnessed.",2021-08-16 17:05:12
"Save 10m, spend way more...",46,p1iy9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/p1iy9i/save_10m_spend_way_more/,3,1628573620.0,"Background info: my employer is a company delivering a specialised service with more than 5k employees, with many local units being rather small (20 employees) and a few intermediary units (300-500). As this service is rather unique, they have their own training centre right next to the headquarters building where new employees get to spend weeks and months learning their job (depending on the job - the closer you get to the customer, the longer you get to learn) and where refresher courses, update courses etc. are being run for all employees within certain departments. 

We used to have our own accommodation on site near the the training centre - a company-run, mid-size hotel (+- 150 rooms), nothing fancy, but you had a clean room with a bed, WC/shower, a fridge and a TV. Communal kitchen for long-term guests etc. and a bar with rather attractive prices - a great way to bond within the company, as everybody you encountered there obviously was a colleague, so finding some topics to talk about was easy, and after having spent a few weeks there every year, chances were really good you'd have built up a comprehensive professional and social network within the company. That happy state of affairs obviously was about to change...

One day, out of the blue, there was an announcement by upper management that the company would have to close and knock down the hotel. Officially, this was because renovating would have been prohibitively expensive, upgrading to today's standards. This sounded a bit ... fishy  ... but then they told us they had made a calculation...

Accommodation in the company owned hotel, run as a corporate service, had cost approx. 30 units of money per night. Taking the cost of renovation into account (rumoured to  be more expensive than rebuilding the whole building),  they calculated that sending every employee to a normal hotel at an average cost of 60 units of money per night would be cheaper in the long run (10 years). Even those involved in the calculations admitted these numbers were ""political "" numbers.

The first contract with the neighbouring hotels for a company rate was already higher than the calculated average cost, IIRC 66 units of money vs. the calculated average of 60. Multiply this by a couple of thousand nights per year... And once ""our"" hotel had been knocked down (costing way more than calculated officially) and there was no alternative,  care to guess what the neighbouring hotels did in the next round of negotiations? ...

We - the employees - still think it was more about breaking up that community and company spirit, not about the money.",2021-08-10 08:33:40
“A humorous anecdote”;,54,ot9xts,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ot9xts/a_humorous_anecdote/,8,1627478995.0,"
I’m a fairly reserved and quiet person but I have a silly sense of humor that folks don’t expect. Today, I freaked my Supervisor out which is hilarious cause he’s a manly man. 

While on plant site we’re required to wear hard hats outside. They wear out as in accordance with the principles of entropy. They become discolored and brittle. The lining might fray. What have you. It’s a hard hat. Not necessarily a complex piece of machinery. 

So, a pedant authored an elaborate email detailing how one ought to perform a hard hat inspection. ( I am now rated to repair the M3 tactical helmet)[props if you get the reference]

My supervisor brought this up in the morning meeting as a safety topic. I’d skimmed the email and extracted the gist: “make sure it ain’t broke”. So, while he was going through the email point by point I began Miming a thorough hard hat inspection. 

At the end of it, with my sups wrapped attention on my hardhat inspection I proceeded to bite the brim of my hardhat like how they test gold coins in cartoons. At which point my sup faltered in his meeting discussion point which followed after the hardhat thing. He’s a stoic guy but it just didn’t compute. I was rolling on the floor laughing mentally but for the performance to be complete I had to maintain a dead pan face for the rest of the meeting, “Nothing out of the ordinary here”.",2021-07-28 16:29:55
“Do your job do what you’re here for!”,54,orpvbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/orpvbw/do_your_job_do_what_youre_here_for/,4,1627267738.0,"That’s probably my favorite quote from the film “Fury”. Today I felt that want to slap a group of people and tell them to do their jobs. That great scene where Wardaddy forces Norman to shoot a Nazi. 

I’m a tech guy at work. I used to be a blue collar guy. 

Today we had a problem with a chemical feed system. Essentially, a piece of equipment was taken offline but a chemical pump associated with the system was left in service. An acid pump. Dropped the pH of a million gallon reservoir down to about 3. Not Superbad. But we like the pH around 7.5.

I ended up having do so some calibration on the pH probes to ensure the feedback was correct. This should have been the scope of my involvement. Before I became tech guy I was chemistry guy specializing in water treatment.

The blue color guys were asked to add a caustic chemical to the reservoir to increase the pH to normal parameters. They opted to fill a 5 gallon bucket halfway using a tiny pump. It took 15 minutes to fill a 5 gallon bucket halfway. They did this 25 times over the course of ~6 hours. It increased the pH from 3.0 to 3.5

They looked to their boss for leadership, the boss said “ you know what needs to be done”. So, evidently the boss didn’t know what to do. 

I chimed in, telling them they should fill an empty carboy with the caustic chemical from the bulk storage tank. Attach a hose to bulk storage tank, put the hose into empty carboy, fill carboy, feed bulk chemical into reservoir. Easy.

I watched grown men mewl about and complain that the right hose wasn’t immediately available. I knew the hose was always kept in a specific place. I went and retrieved it. Dropped it off for these grown men to use. They, a group of three, then looked at the hose and the coupling and guessed whether it was the right fit. They didn’t just attach the hose. Instead they looked at the hose and the coupling and guessed.

At this point I said, “fuck it”

I filled a carboy. Told one to get a fork lift. Told another to get a portable metering pump, and told another to retrieve a ratchet strap. Solved the problem in about 20 minutes. This was expressly not my problem but the sight of grown men shocked into decision paralysis was just too pathetic for me to handle.

I’m not that old, many of these “men” are older than me. The sight of them unable to formulate a plan of action and execute it as part of their job duties was eminently disheartening.",2021-07-26 05:48:58
Supervisor fails to report my on the job injury,50,oojfg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/oojfg0/supervisor_fails_to_report_my_on_the_job_injury/,13,1626844499.0,"So my company is a fabulous (insert sarcasm) place to work. I got injured on the job, notified my supervisor immediately and they fail to report it to HR for nearly a month.  They continue to have me working as usual, which include lifting heavy industrial sized doors (manual doors) inspecting vehicles including the roof of large trucks and SUV’s with no ladder or anything (for context I’m 5’3 and a girl so pretty petite) and generally doing the work I shouldn’t be doing.  

Finally after 5 complaints to my supervisor and being ignored, I went to my doctor myself. I have a torn rotator cuff in my dominant arm.  Where no overhead motion is acceptable under any circumstances, no heavy lifting, etc all of which I had continued to be forced to do for weeks. The kicker is the reason my supervisor failed to report my injury. The reason given was because I have rheumatoid arthritis they felt my shoulder wasn’t serious and related to that so they never reported it to HR.  

Had a family emergency yesterday, loss of a family member. Took yesterday and today off to be with my family. Got an email from HR saying they will ALLOW me to be with my family for these 2 days but only if I forfeit my already approved time off for next week for a combo birthday/anniversary trip we have already prepaid for and is too late to get even a partial refund on. My birthday is Saturday and our anniversary is next Thursday. I also have to forfeit my Thanksgiving plans because of this. Last time I checked death in the immediate family was not penalized. 

I’m going to call out every day until they fire me.  I already have another job lined up and frankly I don’t care about this company because it’s clear they don’t give a damn about me.  I’m also considering calling a lawyer because refusing to file an accident report based on my disability is highly illegal.  By causing me to delay care they potentially made my injury more severe and I’m likely to have lifelong issues from my shoulder now. My claim was immediately approved by the work comp adjuster so I’m grateful for that but it seems like this is the company trying to push me out.

Well the joke’s on them I was planning on leaving.  And the bigger joke is they screwed up big time and violated the ADA laws and also state workers comp laws.  And I have proof in the form of a text message from my supervisor where they say clear as day the reason they never sent in the accident form was because they felt it was no big deal due to my RA.

This morning, before my 9AM shift in the leasing office, I decided to work out in the gym on the property.

A furious tenant marched up to my leasing office, and spotted me in the gym while she was walking away. She bursts in, tearing me apart for serving her notice on late rent.  Mind you, I’m not on the clock. I don’t do well with this kind of thing, so I went back to my apartment sobbing. 

I collect myself and get to my leasing office to start the work day, and immediately get 3 calls from a number I try not to pick up. I finally cave and proceed to get screamed at by another resident over the same thing- receiving a notice for a balance. Neither of these residents pay their own rent, by the way.  I get that covid threw a wrench in everyone’s life, but yelling at some 25 year old chick that just serves the notices given to her doesn’t fix a damn thing.

Right as I have to hang up the phone because the resident won’t calm down, another resident walks into my office and I proceed to burst into tears, trying to explain through my sobs that I had just been verbally abused over the phone.

Craziest thing though- I reached out to my boss because I really did want to help. Turns out he made a mistake on his end with cashing rent relief checks, and all the balances were the wrong amounts. So I have to serve notices again. Tomorrow. I tried to explain to him the awful situation this mistake is putting me in, he couldn’t be bothered.

A few minutes pass by, the guy is still knocking and the donor in the lobby lets me know he is still there.  And the 
N they ask if I want them to let him in.  I tell them no, we are closed and as long as he’s not bleeding through his wrappings, he cannot come in.  

I finally leave at 715 and the guy who was knocking stops to tell me that he had called ahead around 630 to let us know he was on a bus and on his way.  He arrived around 645 and decided to have a cigarette before he came in.

This guy smelled of new donor to me and I was about ready to burst out laughing.  New donors take two to four hours to build even before they get into the chair and with our only medical staff person doing the job I just left, he wouldn’t have been able to sign up today anyway.  

He tells me that he was sitting out front at the time we were open, but when he went to go inside the door was locked.  He said I needed to let him in.  I reminded him we lock the door at 7.  I explained that if he was inside before then, he would be welcome to donate, but once we lock the doors we are done accepting donors for the night.  

He reminds me that he was there before 7, that he spoke with someone who said he would be fine to donate, and demanded me to let him in.  

I reminded him he was there at 645 and decided to have a cigarette instead of come inside, and our doors were now locked and we could not take him tonight.  

He went off an out not wanting to donate with us anyway, quickly turned to his girlfriend and demanded she call the other center to let them know they were on their way.  He then turned to me, crossed his arms and gave me that look that stated “what do you think about that?”

So I smiled and wished him a great night.  I forgot to mention that the other center closes at 7 as well, so by the time his bus comes and he gets over there, they will be well closed.  

Our center pays the most out of any in our area, so he’ll have to come back tomorrow if he’s after the money.",2021-06-05 05:17:51
Ma'am...your vacuum is not safe.,106,nmqgqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/nmqgqs/maamyour_vacuum_is_not_safe/,8,1622178951.0,"Hiya, I work front office and counter in a Vacuum/Sewing sales/repair shop and we get all kinds of people who try to do their own repairs because...

""it's just a vacuum, how hard can it be?"" 

or the fan favorite ""I just looked it up on YouTube!"" 

As it turns out, it can be very hard for most people who don't know the little ticks each machine has. The woman who came into the store was one of those people.

In walks an older woman, we'll call her Nancy. (I have no idea what her actual name was, glad I didn't ask either.) Nancy has a Dyson canister vacuum that she has used for 5 years and it's not working well! The brush roll on the bottom doesn't turn right and it makes this strange pulsating sound while it's running. While she's describing this, myself and one of my technicians (let's name him Bob) have already started listing ideas of what could be wrong based on what she is telling us, because the pulsating is a new one for us. I also want to be sure to mention that our lead vacuum technician (We'll call this one Larry) who is on his lunchbreak behind the counter. Larry takes shit from no one, an army veteran who knows what he can do and how to get it done; he has no issue telling you what's what. At this point, he was eating a sandwich and just listening.

While Bob and myself are diagnosing the vacuum, this apparently frustrates Nancy.

Nancy: ""Can we get past the guesswork and ask one of the *VACUUM guys* what's wrong?""

Oh, Nancy.

Me: ""Ma'am, we are trying to find out where exactly we need to begin to find out your problem. If you give me a moment, I'll need to plug it in.""

Nancy: ""Obviously.""

Canister vacuums will almost always have a retractable cord, unless it is a much older model, this Dyson was no exception. She had tied a white cloth around the end of the cable, assuming that it should be easy to grab and pull when you go to plug it in, I'd seen it before. I pulled on the cable and was approaching the outlet, pulling back the fabric knot when I thankfully noticed the large amount of black electrical tape wrapped around the end. The cord had been spliced, the original plug end cut off and replaced with a new one. Dyson vacuum cleaner power cords are thick, commonly with three wires that run through to the end to a 3-prog plug.   


Nancy had spliced the power cable for a table or a desk lamp to her vacuum cleaner power cable, one with only two wires.

I held up the cable to Larry who turned and looked at it and I heard Bob sigh from the other side of the counter. 

Larry: ""That's not safe. Gonna start a fire.""

Me: ""Yeah, I'm sorry ma'am, but I'm not plugging this in in our store. It wouldn't be safe. We can do a cord replacem-""

Nancy: ""Well it's worked just fine for me, just plug it in and test it!"" 

She's getting irate because I won't potentially start an electrical fire at the plug I'm holding. How dare I preserve our store and my coworkers safety.

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm not going to plug this in. I don't even recommend taking this home and using it anymore. It's clearly a fire hazard. We can replace the cord and check from there, but-""

Nancy: ""I'm just taking it back. You people are ridiculous, it works just fine.""

*Then why did you need it fixed Nancy?*

She proceeds to take her vacuum back and waltz out the door, telling us we didn't know what we were talking about, how rude we were that we wouldn't help her, and that she wouldn't be back! I was sure to inform her before she left that we weren't responsible for anything that happened once she left the store, and that we had cameras to show that we told her not to take it back to use. 

The only other thing I heard from Larry about Nancy was him muttering ""Dumbass...""

I worry for the other members of that home.",2021-05-28 08:15:51
Why don’t you don’t sound like your face??,62,nhjexv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/nhjexv/why_dont_you_dont_sound_like_your_face/,0,1621569229.0,"Glad I found a subreddit this story fits under. 

Obligatory: on mobile, english is not my first language, etc. 

I used to work front desk for an auto repair shop whose parent company is one of those luxury dealerships whose vehicles are actually worth more than some people’s life insurance (mine). 

The shop’s conveniently located right next to the dealership on the same parking lot so our customers can stroll over and browse the showroom if they like. Driving up, there’s a very nice sign telling people, left for showroom and service centre; right for autobody repairs. 

That day we’d already checked in all of our appointments. Since part of my job is closing out files for invoicing insurance companies, I was in one of the inner offices double checking an “invoice rule” with my boss. While we’re doing that I hear someone come in, but thought that it’s nothing my coworker can’t handle. 

I finish up with my boss and start making my back down to the front desk. The person who came in’s still there, insisting he has an appointment with us. 

Now we’re all very OC about the schedule. Working for a luxury brand does garner some extremely entitled clientele so any minute detail missed WILL BE LITERAL HELL. 

So we know for a fact he does not have an appointment with us. He sees me walking up and with a shit-eating smile goes, “Her! I spoke to her on the phone!” 

I go, “Apologies, but I don’t recall making appointments for this afternoon. What type of service were you looking for?” 

His jaw literally drops. He starts sputtering, and instead looks at my coworker saying, “I spoke to a Chinese lady on the phone and made an appointment for sales…” 

I’m the only visibly Asian person working the front desk. Yes, I am Chinese, but I was born elsewhere, lived the last decade or so in North Am and have since grown a North Am accent. 

We sorted him out and he apologized to me before happily making his way to the showroom.",2021-05-21 06:53:49
When your client is surprised that being fired isn't considered a good thing.,105,nfp5t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/nfp5t1/when_your_client_is_surprised_that_being_fired/,8,1621379236.0,"Standard apology, I'm not on mobile, I just suck at formatting.

Warning: Long

I get a call during lunch from my no 1 Client From Hell whose three businesses I do bookkeeping for. ""Good news!"" he says. ""Well since I figured you and $Boss were doing me a favor anyway by taking over Business C (the one with actual clients and lots of work to do) after last bookkeeper quit (A job that was 15 hrs a week,  $47K a year that she quit because she couldn't handle the BS.) I thought I'd let you know I hired your old colleague Brenda to do the bookkeeping so you don't have to do it anymore! Let me know when you come into Business C so I will have her meet you there so you can train her.""

I had been doing the bookkeeping since 11/18. I really didn't know it was ""temporary"", but since he really overpaid (paying a tax office to do it @ 70$/hr) he could have always hired someone and saved money at any time. I was just hoping he'd offer me the job first because I only worked part time and could use the money. My boss said if he chose to do that she'd understand and gave me her blessing. I fixed the crap that was in the ledgers, I streamlined and revamped the billing process reducing hours to process, I put all the clients on e-mail to save postage, I set up payroll and other bills through direct deposit, I saved him $25K the very first year by bringing the hours down needed to do the work. He was so grateful he gave me a $2000 Christmas bonus and did so the year after, when his total cost for the year was then about 17K (including the bonus).

The worst thing about it all is, I had been limping along without tech support for our ancient version of Quickbooks since 2020, figuring things out myself, otherwise just leaving things I couldn't figure out. We had just downloaded the new version and since the first download I had changed my mobile phone. The Intuit Solution was to take a picture of my drivers license and send it to them to process letting me back in the account.

I sent them the image last Thursday, two business days before my firing.

Four hours after finding out I was fired, I go into train the new replacement. Before she shows up, I talk to the store manager who was always friendly with me and complained about the abrupt firing and the way it had gone over. That's where I screwed up. She was not a friend, she was a client's representative.

Then Brenda, the new replacement came in. She used to work for my $Boss and now works for one of our clients and we interact monthly, very friendly. Store Manager asked if we should get Client on speaker and I said ""I really don't want to talk to him right now"" Strike two. (By the way, Brenda came in to train at 4:15 PM and no, I didn't plan on working past five) I show her what I'm working on (how much can you train someone in 45 minutes?) and then have her do what I'm doing and by that time it's 5pm and I go.

Next day, I'm called to the office, Both Bosses are there. Fuck. After I have a seat.

$Boss: ""You know what you did.""

Me: ""Not really...?""

""You yelled at Manager in front of customers (LIE: it was back in the office behind a hallway with closed doors). and said you didnt care about their business and didn't care about the client and didn't care about us either!""

""That is NOT true.""

""Well that's what they said,"" shrugs like it doesn't matter because it doesn't. ""Anyway, you have been removed from the other main account of clients, they are coming tomorrow to pick up his computer and files. He is no longer comfortable with you doing Business B""

He didn't say anything about Business A, my first of his, but those files are on his computer as  well.

Me: ""In that case he's on his own, I'm not training my replacement.""

$Boss: ""I completely understand.""

Sorry, Brenda, you will have to figure out invoicing on your own. Good luck with Client from Hell your new boss. He almost seems human.

ETA: Client would often worry ""What if you get hit by a bus"" well now he gets to experience what it's like. I got hit by a bus, and now he's on his own. He recently inherited all three businesses from his father, rich ""kid"" mid 50's. Dumb as dirt. Doesn't comprehend two-part questions.

Ok guys help. I have a coworker/manager that kinda just creeps me out. He’s friendly and we talk mainly because I’m talkative and everyone just seems to respond...but he TALKS, And goes deep. Which was fine for me. Friends are cool, right?

But then I start getting weird vibes. Like maybe I’m crazy, but you know when you think someone likes you? Yeah, those vibes were strong. One time I came in to work and he greeted me with an unwanted hug. One time he also crept up behind me and scared me and touched my shoulders which yikes...didn’t like. 

He talks about the weirdest shit to everyone. Asks about threesomes, age gaps, etc. like my work is pretty relaxed but I guess anything he does just makes me uncomfy?

One time he was asked his type and said quirky, bubbly asians. Which aka is me LOL.

He also knows that I have a boyfriend!! And said my bf seemed standoffish when he one time picked me up from work which is kinda uncalled for lol.

Other weird shit he does:
-He unbuttons his pants at work so that he can release his belly and not feel tightly 
-Has a nickname for me
-Wants to hangout all the time and cant seem to take no for an answer

What do I do? He’s my manager so its kinda hard to report about him but he makes work so unbearable and i get really anxious to go in. I know maybe I’m in the wrong because I might have made him think we were friends but I feel like he doesn’t respect any boundaries",2021-05-17 04:32:10
Trixie Learns to Tweet,51,ncf3hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ncf3hy/trixie_learns_to_tweet/,3,1621015949.0," 

Disclaimer: Not that I think anyone will care to do so, but just in case, I do not give permission for this post to be cross-posted, read out loud, reenacted, or shared in any way, on any other forum or site. Original post on Reddit in the r/talesfromthejob sub on 5/14/2021.

Hey all! Welp, I'm here to vent again about my well-meaning, but INCREDIBLY frustrating nemesis, Trixie. If you'd like to get to know me or Trixie a little better, here's [my first story about her ""Meet Trixie"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/mw87ar/meet_trixie/)

So, Trixie learned a new trick about a month ago. Trixie has learned how to use Twitter, and has mastered enough skills to search for and follow things, people, and organizations that she enjoys, including my organization. She has even mastered the intricate art of tagging other twitter users by ""@""ing their handles. Upon gaining her shiny, new Twitter account, Trixie promptly followed both my professional twitter account, and my organization's account. Like many similar organizations, we deliberately make it easy for all alums, current learners, and professionals in my field to follow us and even encourage them to do so. We never disseminate important programmatic information only via that platform, but we do use it to advertise things like talks or presentations given by our alums, events that we sponsor, graduation ceremony dates, and the promotion and elevation of current learners. It's mostly a benign, less formal way for our social media-minded alums to connect with us and each other about public-facing stuff that has to do with us in some way. Trixie is proud of being accepted into the 2021 Cohort of Professional Learners, and is excitedly anticipating the day she completes the program and joins the distinguished network of alums. The week before last, she tweeted several lovely messages of excitement and support expressing those feelings, and tagged both me and the org. So far, so good.

Unfortunately, Trixie has not mastered the medium enough to understand that the whole, wide world can see anything she Tweets, not just the specific people she tags, and further, she is baffled by the notion that if she replies to a tweet from me (my professional handle) or my organization (which has its own account) her reply is not only visible to the whole world, it also immediately pops up in the feed of the thousands of professionals who follow those accounts. Professionals who may or may not panic at the insane statements she makes, and then proceed to flood my office with calls, emails, and followup tweets.

One of my program-coordinators is a wonderfully talented young woman who handles our social media accounts. To be completely honest, about 95% of the tweets on my professional account come directly from her, without me even seeing them, and for the org account, about 1/2 come from her directly, and about 1/2 I say something like ""Coordinator, please post a tweet on the org account about X event,"" and she then words a lovely, professional tweet and launches it out into the world.

I exited a Monday-morning meeting last week to find about a half-dozen, increasingly panicked messages from that young coordinator last week. I called her immediately and through her tears, she apologized profusely for a tweet she'd apparently sent out from both my professional account, and from the org account about some of our alums that are giving talks at an upcoming professional convention this summer. After I calmed her down and asked her to explain the situation to me, I learned the following:

Coordinator composed an extremely mundane an informational tweet with the times, dates, and registration links for a few talks. Something like, ""We are excited to promote, Alum X and Alum Y who are giving professional talks on their work at blah, blah, blah."" In response, Trixie replied to the tweet with ""serious concern"" that, given our security issues (nonexistent, see that first post for clarification about the ""security breach"") and our propensity for ""being hacked"" (again, completely untrue - see that original post) any credit card info or PII that people might use to register would be compromised. Trixie apparently *thought* that there some such thing as a direct reply to tweet that only the original tweeter can see, and that she had made a ""private reply"". Not a PM, mind you, but rather she is convinced that there is such a thing as a private reply in a public twitter thread. And maybe there is, I don't know; as we already established, I really don't do much tweeting myself. However, even if it does exist, I don't know how to do it, and Trixie *certainly* doesn't know how to, because she just posted that nonsense as a regular old reply, that got seen by thousands of alums and subscribers.

Oh. My. God. It was literally the FIRST reply to the damn tweet, and it prompted a veritable shitstorm of people wanting to know *what breaches* and *is my data compromised?* and *is there another option to register* for the event, which, by the way, is not even our event. It's an event by a completely separate entity that runs a big annual convention for people in my profession. I cannot even tell you the amount of time I spent last month cleaning up this mess. Twitter account cleanup, convincing Trixie that she's an idiot and that if she doesn't remove the inflammatory and misleading tweet that her tuition would be refunded and she would unceremoniously be kicked out of the program and her membership from my wider org revoked, clarifying the mistake to everyone concerned about the ""security issues"" in a way that makes it seem like a simple mistake and not the deep and profound craziness of an otherwise respected professional, liaising with the organization who sponsors the convention and appeasing their (righteous) wrath... Oh lord, what have I ever done in my life to deserve this woman?!!?

I'm pretty nonviolent, next thing to a pacifist, really, but I would truly and deeply like to track down whoever taught her how to tweet and kick their ass.",2021-05-14 21:12:29
Story of my life!!,22,nbpznk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/nbpznk/story_of_my_life/,1,1620936275.0,"I came to the Usa as an international student. Finished my graduation during Covid. Worst time for a student to graduate. I tried my best finding a job, but since the market was at its worst, I got nothing but rejections. Finally I got a job, it’s not what I wanted to do but I took it. If I dint do that I would have to go back to my country. Doing the same work that I don’t enjoy every day is so frustrating! Want to switch but no one wants to give me a chance (because I am entry level). Got a few interviews in Marketing but they don’t want to pay. They want people to work on a commission based pay which is not possible for me since I am a fresh grad. Hate it!! Probably I should just go back to my home country to put an end to all this.",2021-05-13 23:04:35
Kites and Covid,74,mwvktn,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/mwvktn/kites_and_covid/,7,1619185471.0,"Yesterday, we got a company-wide email discussing the new covid policies for May. It didn't go over well. Included were the end of working from home, the stipulation that any covid illness related time off was no longer provided by the company and now had to be personal vacation/sick time, as well as a few other changes that overall weren't received well.

Of course, it takes about two minutes for the employee gossip mill to start going. I almost immediately get a text from one of my friends in another department complaining about it and we commiserate (although honestly, the changes don't affect me much).

Within ten minutes, HR has sent another (presumably unrelated) email. Apparently, April is National Kite Month, and all the employees were invited to a picnic this weekend to fly kites.

So to summarize, first we get an email rescinding our privileges, and then the next email we get from him literally has the subject ""Go Fly a Kite!"" I couldn't help but laugh about it.",2021-04-23 16:44:31
Meet Trixie,66,mw87ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/mw87ar/meet_trixie/,7,1619107763.0,"Disclaimer: Not that I think anyone will care to do so, but just in case, I do not give permission for this post to be cross-posted, read out loud, reenacted, or shared in any way, on any other forum or site. 

Hello All - I originally began posting about Trixie in r/workingmoms \- but I think the posts must have been too story-ish, or maybe inappropriate b/c it has a mild curse or two? Not sure, and the mods never deigned to message me back, so I'm going to see if y'all are more interested. 

This is a rant, a LONG rant, because I'm really frustrated and I need a place to post stories about the current bane of my existence (Trixie) where I can change a few key details, and, hopefully, stay anonymous. Plus, moaning to sympathetic strangers will, in the end, be far better than saying these words aloud to any of my colleagues, who are, after all, basically the ones I'm complaining about. I don't need or want any advice (though I would LOVE to hear you vent your frustrations too!), I'm just venting because I'm frustrated - I really do love my job, and worked HARD to get here, but sometimes, man, sometimes...

So I work in a role where I manage a Professional Development-type program for other professionals with my credentials. We must all have doctorates and a minimum of 12-15 years of experience to be what we are. Think, like, lawyers or doctors (it's not either of those things, but that's the ballpark of time, education, and credentialing needed to be called an ""official one"" of what we are.) I say all this not to toot any horns, but rather to make the point that pretty much everyone involved in my job is a middle-aged professional with too much school and a lot of work experience under our belts. It SHOULD mean that we're all capable of being organized adults with a decent grasp on modern technology, but of course, it doesn't. One of my learners is particularly getting under my skin this year.

Let's call her Trixie. I have actually created this account specifically to post stories and vent about Trixie. I've never met a person like her, and she leaves me bewildered.

We've got about 100 learners in a course that takes roughly 15 months to complete. The course has live components (all done on Zoom for now), on-line, self-paced components, homework assignments, and evaluations for all live sessions. Aside from building this program, fundraising for this program, staffing the committee of the professionals who advise for this program, choosing competencies and faculty, and overseeing the creation and upkeep of the online components, I spend maybe about 8 hours per week responding to emails from the learners. Typically, in these emails, I'm talking to them about individual challenges they're facing at work or with the program, working out logistical challenges, and generally coordinating between them and our faculty when needed.

And then there's Trixie. This year, I have been forced to devote, at a minimum, 1 full day per week to this woman.

Trixie does a lot of frustrating things, but today, I'm here to vent about the emails. Dear, sweet, baby Jesus, save me from the emails.

You see, Trixie likes to email my staff, my boss, and myself constantly with separate emails to each of us (5 people in total) about the same technical problems - always related to the fact that she is functionally computer illiterate (Woman! How did you complete a goddamn dissertation in the last 20 years?!!? Seriously, she can barely open Word without a step-by-step tutorial with pictures and arrows.) but always worded like it's an issue from our end. Like ""SOS - Document X is Corrupted!"" or ""Can't access the evaluation! Is the link broken?"" and once, memorably, ""I Think Your Organization's Learning Center has Been HACKED!!!!!""

Actual Translation?

*SOS - Document Y is Corrupted!* = Her son updated her computer security settings so that she actually has to open her downloads folder, right-click on any file she downloads, go to ""properties"" and click ""unblock"" before it will open. I can only assume her son did this out of sheer self defense because her computer illiteracy has led to countless downloads of viruses and spyware. If she tries to open a document before deliberately unblocking it, she will get an error message. Then she will send separate emails to me, my staff, and my boss. At this point in the year, they will all just fwd them to me, because we are all now fully aware of the situation, but in the beginning, we all wasted a bunch of time answering the same question before we realized in a staff meeting that we were all receiving duplicate emails from her. My boss was not amused to be bothered by this, to say the least.

*""Can't access the evaluation! Is the link broken?""* = Rather than clicking on the link to the eval, which is posted in the learning center right under the heading ""Link to session X evaluation,"" or clicking on the link I sent directly to her in the reminder email about the eval, or even clicking on the link that pops up automatically once they complete the module we are asking them to evaluate, Trixie repeatedly only clicks on the miniscule link to the FAQ page, which is part of my email signature. She has, not once, not twice, but **thrice** attempted to complete the image of an example evaluation that is a part of our FAQ. It's literally just a picture, pasted onto a web page, with circles and arrows demonstrating how to click ""next"" after filling in an answer. She is always embarrassed and self-deprecating about this error, but SHE NEVER LEARNS. Inevitably, after the next module on Friday, I will wake up to an urgent email from her (plus all the duplicate emails fwd'd to me by my staff), asking if the link to the eval is broken.

*""I Think Your Organization's Learning Center has Been HACKED!!!!!""* = Trixie somehow managed to circumvent her son and disable the popup blocker on her device. While she was completing one of our online modules on one screen, and browsing the internet on another screen, she inevitably [got this scam pop up ad](https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-attention-your-computer-has-been-infected/) and panicked. The fun part is, she sent this panicked email about nefarious Russian hackers to me, my boss (of course), the head of my company's IT department (she got his email address from the website, I think), and my CEO (no clue how she got his email). So, at this point, you may well be asking yourself, ""How would such a computer illiterate person A) disable their popup blocker, and B) manage to find the fairly well-hidden emails to a couple members of a large company's C-Suite?"" Well, that's a damn fine question, and I'm asking it myself. She can't figure out how to click on the link to a GeeDee eval, but she can figure out how to contact my CEO? Her panicked email was well-written, as you would imagine, coming from such a distinguished professional, and if you just read the email without knowing Trixie, it sounded like it might actually be a concern. Sadly, I never thought to alert my boss to the email when it came in, because it was just another crazy Trixie-issue, and my boss, in turn, had no reason to bring this up with the CEO, because why the hell would she? Who could assume that Trixie would figure out how to contact the CEO, and then randomly do so? Well, she did, and it triggered a big meeting ""to assess security"" and ""get to the bottom of a serious, user-identified, potential breach"" which made me, my boss, and the IT Director all look foolish. My boss and I tried to explain the level of absurdity, but noone on the executive team truly believed the foolishness we told them Trixie is capable of. The IT Director ended up calling Trixie directly and remoting in to her device - that's how he discovered what actually happened.

It's all okay now - my CEO will even occasionally send me an IM asking about his good ol' pal Trixie, but God, it was so embarrassing at the time.

So, that's my Trixie rant for today. I have so many stories built up - if anyone likes this one, I'll share more. I have a really fun one about Trixie learning to tweet that I would LOVE to share.",2021-04-22 19:09:23
Karen wants out NOW!

I work food service at a zoo, where I am basically a front end manager.  For once though, this is only a tangentially food related story.

I was in the middle of giving someone a lunch when the manager radioed that I needed to cut off the line at one of the food carts ASAP.  They were supposed to close at 4:00, but they had a big line and needed me to stop people from walking up.  It was 4:15 by the time I actually got away from this lunch break to do this.  On my way to the cart, one of the aforementioned loaner employees stopped me, she's standing with a middle aged lady and a small child, saying she needed me to get this lady a ""quick way out, right now!""  I can literally see the line growing at the cart I'm supposed to close, and I'm supposed to do the impossible for this Karen.   I tell her it's not going to happen and that I am needed elsewhere, but the employee insists that I help this lady.  \*sigh\*

I stop, put on my best manager voice and say, ""I'm sorry, the only way out is to follow the one way path through the African section.""

""No, I want out now, I don't want to go any further,"" Karen demanded.

""There is no faster way,"" I replied, diplomatically, ""Due to COVID, we have a one way path. I can't get you out any faster.""  It's worth mentioning that we are approximately half way through the one way path, even if I could let her go backwards or cut through staff paths it would take just as long.

At this point, loaner employee totally undermined me with a *the customer is always right*, ""Don't worry, we'll find a way to get you out.""

I tell the loaner employee that we can't do that, and reiterate to Karen that there isn't a faster way out.

""I don't want to go through Africa!"" Karen tells me, waving a print out of the zoo map in my face (not even the current version, because it doesn't have the one way path labeled) ""I came to see the \[native wildlife section\], and it's not even open!  Take me to an exit now.""

""Once again,"" I reply, ""The only way I can get you out is through Africa.""

The loaner piped in again, ""We'll call someone to take you out, don't worry.""  She pointed to my radio, ""call someone who can pick her up, or something.""

At this point, I really just wanted someone else to deal with this, so, with malicious compliance I agreed to call security.  The loaner of course spun it as ""we're getting security to show you the way out.""  I knew that wasn't going to happen, but I just wanted this lady dealt with, so I called security and told them that I had a guest that was insisting on a ""quick way out"" and refusing to follow directions down the path, I told Karen to wait here for security then I walked off toward the line that I was supposed to be capping.

That wasn't enough for the loaner employee though, thirty seconds later, just as I'm getting in line, she called me *back* over, and asked what she was supposed to do with Karen while she waited.  I told her to wait for security to get here and let them know what was going on.  Loaner didn't seem to hear me though, as soon as I turned around, she walked off to go back to what she was doing, so I ended up having to wait with Karen while she stared daggers at me, until security arrived, and I briefed the officer on the situation.  As I suspected, he did *not* escort Karen out.  While I was finally getting to the line I was supposed to close, he had a nice long chat with Karen about the importance of our restrictive measures and why we could not get her out any faster, it must have taken five minutes of arguing with the officer before she gave up and stormed off.  I had to spend the next 20 minutes making more people upset by explaining to them why I couldn't let them get in line for ""one quick little thing,"" because these poor staff were supposed to have been closed for half an hour already and needed to go home.

Sorry Karen, arguing doesn't open any secret doorways to the exit, even if the employee that doesn't actually work here agrees with you.",2021-04-15 08:07:40
Return to office plan announced: no more permanent desks and move to shared co-working spaces? Who asked for this?,119,moz7bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/moz7bw/return_to_office_plan_announced_no_more_permanent/,21,1618174547.0,"My company just announced the return to office plan and it's quite a departure from what things looked like prior to Covid.

\- No more permanent desks for anyone not in a managerial role

\- Employees will have to reserve desks each day via a reservation system. 

\- 30% of current desk space (glorified cubicles) are being torn out in favor of collaboration zones; these will be long tables with no dividers. Each will seat about 10 people.

&#x200B;

My question is, why do this? When they surveyed us a few months ago we all requested a hybrid model where we could work a few days at home and a few days remotely. Remote work may or may not be permitted after Q3.

I'm probably venting as much as I am asking questions, but why remove desks and make us reserve them each day when we've been remote for a year, and had a very successful year. The company just announced we had our best Q1 ever, and as a reward we will soon lose our desks?

Is anyone else in this boat? It really feels like they're just telling us we're disposable. Probably because we are. Also, we aren't technically out of the pandemic...why make us less-socially distanced?",2021-04-11 23:55:47
Every day is Groundhog Day,46,mmw8sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/mmw8sy/every_day_is_groundhog_day/,1,1617901298.0,"This is a long one but worth the read.

So, just over a year ago I posted a story in here about a type of customer I had. It’s the one we all dread but quite often deal with, the self entitled d******d. I work 2 jobs one of them is a part time PE teacher and the other one, is based part time at a hardware store here in the UK, and whilst the country went in and out of lockdown like a pendulum we stayed open as essential retail. And during this time I can safely say I’ve been screamed at, spat on, threatened and had customers offer to sort my attitude out in the car park. 

Nine times out of ten all they’re talking is empty and they’re having a bad day and I just ignore it but I had a customer during the second stint of the countries lockdown push my buttons a little too much.

A bit of background, I’m on shift, working a late, no one likes them, you start at 12 leaving little time to accomplish anything in the morning but finish at 8 meaning you can’t get anything done in the evening. I’m tired, overworked and fed up. The store implemented a click and collect only policy so no one could buy directly in store and possibly create a queue. It minimises the risk of covid spread and keeps everyone safe. 

Anyway, it’s 7:30pm, the store is quiet and I just want to go home and sleep. When This hobbit looking, one ring carrying, Frodo looking man came sauntering in like he owned the place and came straight to the till. No mask, didn’t sanitise his hands, smelt of pure sweat and just looked like he hadn’t heard of water. He demands to be served and says he’s after some “bits”. I said do me a favour mate and stand behind the screen, to which he just ignores and says “you going help me or not”. I said what “bits” are you after? He proceeds to rattle off over 15 items, some of which I’ve never heard off. I’ve worked here of 2 years at this point and work on the side of the store that deals and looks after the trade guys as they put more money into the business than general public. So through them I learn a lot and I’m expected to know what we do and do not sell in store. I slide this guy a catalogue, tell him most of what he’s after is in here but half of it we don’t sell and I told him where would be open in the morning for him to buy it. 

I’m giving him this catalogue you’d of thought I’d of dropped my trousers and asked him to have a gander at me. He looks outraged and insulted, proceeds to go off on a tangent about how I’m a cocky t**t and how he’s going to kick the s**t out of me and proceeds to walk out of the store and just stand in the door way staring at me. Me being a sarcastic idiot waved at him and shouted bye. Well he didn’t take kindly to it and then started shouting about how he’s going to slice me up and get the boys to come down. At this point I’ve had enough and I head straight outside and square straight up to him and start shouting whats he going to do now and telling him to slice me then as he put it. 

The absolute panic on his face when my big ass 6’3’ frame barged into him and called him out on his shit. He did what I like to the call the looney tunes run, where his feet where-a-moving but the rest of him stayed put on the spot 😂

One verbal warning later it’s all done and dusted. Just felt I should share the type of nonsense that goes on in retail.

(P.S. the story sounds better in person and I acknowledge I should handled it better but I will never let anyone threaten and try to bully me to get what they want)",2021-04-08 20:01:38

A tale of firing: Never attend your sons game while on the job,95,m8qour,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/m8qour/a_tale_of_firing_never_attend_your_sons_game/,5,1616186862.0,"This is a tale from 4 years ago at my prior Custodial job, involving one of my co-workers (henceforth referred to as fool). The fool was a fairly lazy and not very productive custodian who worked in the same school building I did. As it so happened, two of her sons were attending that school at the time and one of them was on the varsity football team.

Now, to set some background, the fool was on very thin ice with the administration. She had run out of leave time and once when she had to take an unpaid day they gave her hell over it. She was also suspected by everyone for stealing supplies. In addition to this, she had been taken before the Board of Education itself over her leave issues and was put on probation, which makes her foolish decision even more glaring.

In early December of 2017 her son was off the team temporarily for concussion protocol. He was not playing the home game that night but said fool decided to slip in and attend anyway for a few hours. This did not go unnoticed. The administrator in charge of us custodians spotted her in the crowd, knowing full well it was the middle of her shift. By rule, she could spend her lunch there so long as she reports back to her area before 30 minutes are up. Instead, she stays in the stands for a recorded two solid hours. All of this was captured on video, and forwarded next day to the Board of Education. She was summarily fired the next week.

Honestly, she had it coming for a long time in my personal opinion. And, as fate would have it, she did it entirely to herself.",2021-03-19 22:47:42

But some crazy people don’t overreact to things. They just are odd. Here’s an example of one lady who comes to my store. 

The first time I met her, she came in because the prong collar she got from us broke (it wasn’t broken , just was missing a link) and prong collars aren’t super easy unless you know what your doing, which I did not. She came frantically to the door with her dog on the leash. I don’t understand why she couldn’t leave him in the car but okay. Clearly she was struggling. She also revised to come inside so once I came outside she insisted I fix it. I did try but I told her my boss would be in the next day and he could take care of it. She told me she was going back to the city tonight. She ended up leaving it with us and didn’t return for two weeks. 

Then just the other day, after not seeing her for several months, she came back. Didn’t even park in a spot, just out her car in the middle of the parking lot. She came in to get food and then got all upset because her dog doesn’t like salmon (we had other flavors) finally she left and I watched her leave out the only way in/out. Maybe 10 minutes later I was carrying out a big bag to a lady’s car when I hear someone talking.  I look behind me and this lady is walking around our building with her dog, muttering to herself. I went back in and saw that she was now parked out back, somehow. She left after another 10 minutes.",2021-03-15 22:20:09
Terrible shut down franchise makes front page news after corporate seizes locations and assets for many same reasons employee had tried warning owner and is admin prior,75,m467e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/m467e5/terrible_shut_down_franchise_makes_front_page/,7,1615641793.0,"Edit, ... and his admin prior

(This post was approved prior by mod team as long as it had names and places removed.)

This is a bit of a long therapeutic story, so bear with me - TLDR at bottom.

Over twenty years ago my life and plans that I had to stay in my hometown were drastically uprooted and found myself moved to another city. Pounding the pavement almost every day looking for work wasn't getting me any results and would from time to time find myself relaxing at a cheap diner and reading a complementary newspaper... and there it was a job opening for an assistant manager for an expanding well entrenched fast food franchise in town. 

So I called and basically set up my own interview (one of many more omens I seemed to have missed) and tadaa got the job. About 4 or so months in I started seeing clues that I should have picked up on that this operation had some serious issues. That started when they had a custom built location created in the city's more desirable west end closer to the university and they made so many mistakes causing needless delays, to top it off the restaurant district manager was driving the small bobcat front loader while teenage new hires who have never experienced physical labour were laying grass sod, on the sidewalk. Not hiring capable crew for the work required was the least of the concerns that I managed to miss, overlook or otherwise dismiss... also note that the owner and his head office was based a 4 hour+ drive north and for all intents and purposes was an absentee to his own operation. 

For a two year period, I personally witnessed the following;

- general manager (my boss) smoking in office and food prep area even after being told repeatedly to stop

- harassing phone calls to people from owner's assistant when health department visited the above location and cited the blatant health violations 

- deep fryer catching fire and disciplining/terminating employees for calling fire department. 

- the above mentioned owner's assistant at the up north head office writing up employees with disciplinary action for breaking non exisent company policy and making it visible to everyone before that person even saw it for a non existent policy.  ... and then dismissing their actions as an oopsie even though this was yet another blatant law (privacy laws) violated by them.

- disciplinary action against hourly wage employees that don't attend unpaid meetings on their days off, this is also a blatant violation of our provincial law that I should have looked up, internet access wasn't something I had then as we all do now. 

- that's just stuff off the top of my head that I personally experienced. Edited to add, upper level managers were fired after stealing substantial amounts of money, at least one of whom who was vocal in his dismissal of my concerns of how bad things were - he was finally fired after he came in after hours and submitted multiple fraudulent refunds on the new debit machine.  While I was a manager there, a long prolonged pattern emerged of multiple managers along with regular staff quitting suddenly and outright no-showing leading me and others to routinely do 16 hour shifts to cover absences - somehow we were lead to believe this was somehow normalized.

And there's more, so much more. 

I kept doing my best and upper management still complained and told me I have all the tools I need to do things better, on the same day the deep fryer caught fire ***again***. I want to call what they did gaslighting for how inadequate I was made to feel when also they kept ignoring my pleas for them to do things right including hire competent maintance services. Despite my best efforts, pleas and other attempts at pointing out serous problems with equipment and logistics, it was on deaf ears.

Another omen that I missed was that the locations in owner's town and base of operations got shut down, but hey he was a professor of business at the local university... more on that later.

The day came when served a paper saying I was the squeaky wheel, and I got greased - the wagon was rolling on without me. Initially it sucked, a day off to myself and I started feeling better and chatting with friends had them saying I should've said something earlier when I told them of the terrible things people experienced there. A week later I was working a better job with better people I kept in touch with, in a few months I'd leave that industry and that city behind as family needed my help at their home. I would also take solace in realizing it seemed I was the only manager that left who wasn't dealing drugs, stealing or carrying on other questionable acts.

Life went on and got much much better, even getting licensed in a trade that includes investigating employment violations, using my skills to prevent others having to experience what I endured and/or seek appropriate remedy has been very fulfilling. 

Some years pass and it's Halloween 2007, I find myself back for a friend's party in the city where those terrible franchises are run... or as I was to abruptly find out ***were*** run. Prized mall location, closed. West end location, abandoned. Original place I started, closed with pending construction nearby. Signs posted in windows are for a multinational holding company, mall staff say the location there is under renovations. I call bs, owner was adamant about running 24hour operations and wouldn't close down like this - and ***All*** of his franchise locations are shut down. After some discrete inquiries and getting as far as I'm willing at the time, I reach out to local newspaper with what I found and the contradictory information been thrown about from various sources. Along with the recent finds I share my documentation and experiences which makes both the reporter and I wonder how that franchise even lasted that long. 

About two weeks later around mid November it's front page news about how corporate SEIZED all the assets and locations of the franchise owner in August 2007. The reason, many of the ***same problems I warned the franchise owner and his admin about!***

***Assets seized totalled about $10 million.***

To highlight even more of the shadiness of the owner and his operation, when legal notices were served, the owner told frightened workers it's a mistake and to ignore it and keep working... and then shortly later about 200 people were out of work and wondering about getting paid (edit, this information comes from reported court documents).

I sat back, and laughed a bit. I felt horrible for the workers but I was also told they were compensated by corporate as part of the proceedings. Later on I would go on to speak with another worker who told me that prior to the franchise getting shut down, the very same assistantof the owner who harassed and yelled and snapped at me and other employees broke even more laws. This so called operations manager at head office was recorded threatening the worker and telling her to return to work when she was off on workers compensation! For those unaware up here that's a serious offense and pretty much on brand for how they ran their now terminated business. I'll admit to making an honest error or two while working for that franchise, but holy hell I'd never conjure committing blatant wrongs and unlawful acts like they did on the regular and with what they probably thought they could get away doing with impunity - it's safe to say that a pattern of dishonesty, abuse, and incompetence can have a high price tag as it did here.

Oh, remember how I mentioned the owner was a professor of business at his local university, that one got shut down a month or so ago due to financial insolvency. Karma or irony, I can't tell but given the track record of the franchise owner it seems like it was destiny. 

Five years ago a buddy I kept in touch with showed me the owner's LinkedIn account, instead of accepting responsibility for his involvement with the franchise time period cited in news article he fraudulently claimed to be involved in government consulting instead... account got suspended. Petty? Maybe... providing some well needed accuracy to LinkedIn? Definitely. 

TLDR, I get hired by crappy restaurant franchise and somehow allow myself to join in their descent without realizing how terrible they are even after so many blatant labour, privacy, health and safety law violations. Get fired after speaking up countless times warning them about same stuff corporate would cite as reasons a few years later to seize all franchise assets totalling about $10 million from shady AF owner and have that make front page news.",2021-03-13 15:23:13
Weirdest way to fire someone,91,lzea2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/lzea2m/weirdest_way_to_fire_someone/,14,1615074311.0,"I have a pretty frustrating story \*(one of many)\* about how I ended up getting let go in the most bizzare way ever, after being bullied at my job. 

I was working as a part time office manager, I was doing an alright job, fantastic feedback from office visitors, great upkeep of the office supplies, my only downfalls were office events that I stupidly VOLUNTEERED myself into helping out with (not organising myself). Kids, don't do this. 

I was managing a small office, with most of the sales team - really competitive bunch, workaholics to the bone. Nice people, but they work their asses off. One person in particular, let's call her Laura, she was very clearly a perfectionist. A young first-time manager, with a small team of very young and passionate, hard-working people. For whatever reason, she was ticked off about how I handled the office events, I think I put her into a shitty situation with clients perhaps, because of mishandling the presentation. I'll never know. I fucked up, I apologised about it. Feedback from event was still positive, so I didn't think it was too serious. Lessons learned. 

Since those mishaps she made it a daily task of hers to micro manage me. She literally acted as if she was my manager, asking me about my work at least 3 times a day. Then she went and complained to my actual manager about what a bad job I am doing. To which my manager would get reviews from the rest of the office and receive positive feedback about me from everyone, apart from Laura. This continued for 2 weeks before I started realising that my entire performance was dropping drastically. I was making stupid mistakes all over the place that I've never done before and was so stressed out by her, I had to take breaks in the bathroom to just cry it out. She drove an anxiety I didn't even know I had. 3 months later I started therapy for the first time in my life. 

One day she shouted at me in the kitchen area, in front of our HR, she said ""Look, I will not be nice anymore. You know you're doing a shit job, you have been for months."". I was stunned, I couldn't reply with anything. I was at my limit, I was confused, didn't know how I let myself get this way, how I let it affect me so much it was affecting my job and performance. After some deliberation and a lot of courage, the following week, I requested a 1on1 with HR and I complained about Laura's behaviour, providing messages and emails she has been sending me, asking me to do tasks that are outside my job description, following up on them within literally minutes and overall being extremely aggressive and disrespectful. What HR proceeded to tell me was far beyond anything I imagined at this point. In my head this was going to go in either them acknowledging it and doing something about it or not doing anything about it. What happened in reality was, they said ""I see. That's really unfortunate. But Laura is under a lot of stress right now, did you know she's pregnant?""

...

Once again, I was left speechless. All I could utter after what felt like an eternity of silence was 'being pregnant doesn't give you the right to be shit to people' and then it was their turn to be silent, so I just left the room.

Literally 2 days later, my manager showed up in the morning and asked me to hand in my laptop, without using it and leave. Yes, she 'fired me'. On paper I was let go out of my contract work due to end of contract.  

&#x200B;

I had to vent this out somewhere. I still feel so weak when I think back on the situation, I wish I could've handled it differently.

The time I got my manager SACKED,93,lrisc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/lrisc0/the_time_i_got_my_manager_sacked/,7,1614188932.0,"So for a little back story this all happened 17 years ago (2004), at the time I was working as a support worker in a residential, home working 3 nights a week. I had a manager who (for her position) was really kind, Let's call her Kind Manager and my deputy Manager is Not So Kind Deputy.

Every time I worked at night, Not So Kind Deputy would come into the care home and (at the time) I thought it was just a normal check for sleeping staff. But it should only be taking place once a few months (huge red flag but no concern was raised). Every single night I worked, Not So Kind Deputy would turn up at the home, go to the office and stay there for a few minutes before saying goodbye and leaving. 

So one night Not So Kind Deputy came three times in ONE night, giving me lame excuses, I forgot my passport, I forgot details for a form, I needed to pick up a document and so on. I let her in all three times still not suspicious or raising concern about any of it. The morning she came three times, I was called into the office just before the end of my shift ,by Kind Manager, and she asked me to unlock the safe where we kept the client details and cash. I told her I didn't know the code for it. In a stern voice, she instantly told me I was lying, I said I wasn't and that same argument went back and forth. She then grabbed a paper showing me records of money going missing every single time I did my night shift, I INSTANTLY knew who it was taking the money...

The KARMA

Kind Manager asked who else it could be and of course I pointed out that every time I worked Not So Kind Deputy would come in and that in fact she came up to three times earlier. She was instantly summoned to the office. After being questioned she instantly broke down and admit to being the thief and swore to return the money. 

It was later found out that she was stealing the money to support her drug life and she got dropped from her position. Since then Kind Manager begged me not to file a complaint on false accusation as they had already built a case on me before even investigating what was really happening. In the end I didn't file the complaint but I DID get to pick my shift times and days so it was a win win situation. 

NOTE: They instantly came for me because Not So Kind Deputy tried to Blame it on me but it totally backfired LOL",2021-02-24 19:48:52
Coworker from hell,34,lni7br,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/lni7br/coworker_from_hell/,0,1613747688.0,"I am on mobile and English are my second language 

Back storie I have worked in a restaurant in South Africa where we had a waiter from hell. This happened a year ago in 2019 in November I started at a small restaurant in my home town, my friend had started a gew months before me and I loved the job.

The cast:me 
Anna (new waiter) 
Eddie(worked there for 2 years) 
Elize(the owner) 
Jennette(awesome cook) 
Christy (awesome cook number 2)
Teresa (cleaner) 

 A few months later a girl started and she was bad lets call her Anna. Anna had never worked a  waiter job before, I have worked in the waiter business for over 2 years because I knew someone that did catering for weddings so I worked for her.

A few days after Anna started we had a motorcycle rally in Town and everyone needed to work. It was a Friday morning and I got to work around 7am and found out that there was a fight, apparently Anna blamed Eddie for putting a place mat under a table to make it stable( but if we had an unstable table me and Eddie would take cart board to make the table stable again) and they screamed on each other until Elize got there and told them to stop or go home and Anna went home so me and Eddie worked a dubbel shift that day.

Last year I got to work and Anna stormed off, when I asked Eddie what happend he told me that she just put the drinks on the table. (note we open or pour the drinks for the customers especially wine) Eddie told her that we open the drinks and ask the customer if we could pour their drinks in their glasses and Anna told him it is 2020 people can help themselves, so me and my buddy gave the table to Eddie because he needed the money and I worked night shift.

A month before we closed the door because of covid Anna's mother still worked their and she were tasked to make the fire for the pizza oven. So the oven went on idle and she decided to use lamp oil to throw in to the fire, butt anyone with common sense would not do that but she did it and got burned badley and when she did it I just walked in after I went and brought me a bottle of kingsley cola and a pack of cigarettes. I did not know what to because I didn't think it was possible for someone to be so stupid. No one liked her and the cooks I liked luckily worked night shift with me butt Anna's mother blumed jennette for giving her the lamp oil. Later that night Elize asked us what happend and told us that Anna's mother told her jennette gave the lamp oil and I quickly said that Jennette , Chrisry and Teresa was outside with me smoking when the accident happend.

Edit:My sister worked there as a bartender and took Anna's mother to the hospital and Teresa helped my sister to take her. At the time we had enough people in the building and Jennette worked that night.

 Despite the insane hours and travel schedule  I loved the job and I was good at it. I had been opening up the California market for two years and had been flying coast to coast every ten days. It came time for me to take a scheduled vacation; I buttoned down the job and hopped on a plane for Baltimore to catch a connecting flight home.

When we landed i pulled out my phone to check for messages and to catch myself up -- no service. I pulled out my laptop to check emails -- couldn't access my account. It subsequently was revealed to me that, while i had been in the air, my whole division  had been closed down and everyone let go...no notice or advance warning of any kind.       

Needless to say I was shocked and somewhat devastated, but in hindsight it turned out to be a wonderful thing. I re- opened my small construction company that I had shuttered to take the job and started doing the same work as an independent for their main competitor, but I have rarely been as surprised as I was that day.",2021-01-02 15:06:53
The Lesson of the Yoyo and the Fire Extinguisher - How to fill your toolbox.,76,ko2sun,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ko2sun/the_lesson_of_the_yoyo_and_the_fire_extinguisher/,11,1609465954.0,"[This is a true story.](https://preview.redd.it/3ijc0b4wmm861.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=484ab20c5178570b8991f65f8dbd49bed3a99167)

My passions are made manifest through the creative application of power tools.

The older I get, the more appreciation I have for the empowerment of owning quality tools. Certainly, there are team and tribe allegiances that border on holy wars, but I’m a complete tool slut and have my DeWalt’s hanging on the wall side by side with my Milwaukee’s. I believe in the right tool for the job: Klein’s for electrical, Husky’s for greasy, Park for bikes, and Bosch for wood. I do my engineering in Windows, edit video on a Mac, and use Linux for hacking and computer projects. Each tool has its strengths, and fanatics following blindly just end up walking into walls.

For twenty-five years, I made a career of amassing as many tools as possible and sharing them with every single person I could. It’s a hell of a way to make a living, but you get to learn a thing or two in the process. I’ve seen fire-breathing dust collectors, a grandmother shatter her dentures (while she was wearing them!) with a kickback, and know the gut-wrenching feeling of the SawStop gunfire when it brings ominous silence to a busy workshop. I’ve seen a thousand CAD students draw parts that can’t actually be made, seen well-intentioned people fuck up enough perfectly good tools and materials to fill a home depot, and watched a CNC guru fling a solid rooster-tail of blue chips like a firehose, thirty-feet across the room.

All of this has taught me that there are three golden qualities that all tools should strive to be: Intuitive, Invisible, and Internal.

A great tool should be intuitive. It takes a decade to master the use of a hammer. It doesn’t matter if you’re a framing carpenter or peening fenders in a body shop, it’s going to take ten years of daily use for the average person to truly master that craft. If you’re blacksmithing, tack on an additional decade, because that’s not just a job - it’s an art form.

But if you set a five-year-old next to a tree stump with a box of nails and a clawhammer, they’ll figure out the basics in the first ten minutes. It’s intuitive and fun because the form and function of the tool enhance its useability. While this certainly won’t work for every single tool, the ones I reach for 80% of the time in my shop are highly intuitive. It may take weeks, or even years of daily use to completely master a tool, but the average person should be able to do basic functions on a tool with ten minutes of instruction at most. Typically, half of that is covering safety so that they don’t immediately hurt themselves or damage the tool.

When I say invisibility is a commanding feature, I don’t mean that you can’t see it. What I mean by invisibility is that you don’t have to be actively conscious of the tool itself, only its function and ability. You want the tool to get out of the way so you can focus on the task at hand. 

A great example of this is the M12 Jigsaw by Milwaukee. Quite simply, it sucks. Certainly, it’s a reasonably priced, capable, little tool that will get the job done when you need it. But to sell it at that price point, Milwaukee dropped a fair set of features that are only found in much more expensive saws. Compared to my Bosch jigsaw, which cost nearly double the price, it’s a night and day difference. When using my M12, I have to constantly get my face right down to the work and blow the swarf off the guideline to make sure I’m still on track. With the Bosch however, using nothing more advanced than a little hole in a piece of plastic, exhausts air down onto the cutting area and makes it so that I can easily see my line throughout the entire cut without even thinking about it.

Both saws have plastic housing with vent holes in them. Both saws have an integrated cooling fan. But the simple design change to allow it to exhaust down into the cutting area versus out the side makes all the difference in the world for me as the operator. When you’re using a jigsaw, you want to be able to focus on following the line, getting a smooth cut, and making the part you need with as little effort as possible. This simple design change puts the Bosch worlds ahead of the Milwaukee because it gets the tool out of the way.

While it’s important to “let the machine do the work” it’s also important to get the damn machine out of your way so you accomplish the job.

A great tool is one that you don’t have to be conscious of using, it simply becomes an extension of your body and an enhancement to your ability. This makes it invisible because you’re not seeing or thinking about it, you’re focused on your work.

The greatest tools of all though, the ones you will use and appreciate the most, are internal. You carry them in the six-inch toolbox between your ears that you’ll spend a lifetime filling. These tools range from the ability to understand feeds and speeds, to recognizing G-Code, to building good habits like remembering to remove the tape measure from the wood before pulling the trigger on the chop saw (not that I’ve ever done that…). These lifelong skills will become invaluable, but like patience and discipline, knowing when to walk away for the day because you’ve fun out of fucks to give, and the ability to improvise, adapt, and overcome won’t simply come to you overnight. Just like learning to use a hammer, these are skills that need to be honed, used, and developed over time. . 

At the end of the day, the measure of any craftsman is their ability to do what they can, where they are, with what they have. Filling your internal toolbox with a comprehensive set of useful skills is the single most important investment you’ll ever make. What will make you stand out as exceptional isn’t just learning the basics for the field you focus on, but learning useful things in other areas as well. Your mental toolbox is the one thing that you’ll always have with you, the thing that no one can take away from you. Feed your brain. 

Let me give you an example.

In a time long ago and in a town far away, part of my job was to give science demonstrations to large groups of school kids. They would show up to the facility on a field trip and over the course of an hour I would do everything from enveloping them in an indoor snowstorm, to launching a metal ring a hundred feet high with an electromagnet, to making explosions, and even blasting lightning twenty feet in open air across the room.

It was a hell of a good time. They got to be entertained and we even managed to learn a thing or two along the way. When you’re hurling lightning bolts and making explosions, it’s not exactly a difficult job to maintain the rapt attention of people, even twelve-year-olds.

I’d done the demonstration a thousand times and was fully prepared when the three busses pulled up next to the lab and kids started pouring out and mobbing our front lobby. We gave them the basic safety briefing about how they were about to enter a room filled with things that will kill you the moment you don’t respect them. Then we led the whole group into the main demonstration hall where I would do the show.

Now, this was a large industrial space. A room big enough that you could have fit several typical two-story houses in it side-by-side. The room was supported by I-beam columns spaced every twenty feet; at the base of every-other column around the perimeter of the demonstration area sat a standard fire extinguisher. Nothing special, just a basic extinguisher, the entire facility was full of them because of the nature of the things we played with and our well-justified predilection for safety. In twenty-five years I never set a single student on fire, despite several classes where it really did seem like a tempting idea.

You’ve met those kids. I was one of them.

I was just hitting my stride, we’d launched the ring, learned about standing waves with the flame-throwing Ruben’s Tube, and things were rocking along just fine when a plume erupted from the back of the audience and everyone started coughing and yelling.

Someone’s wee precious child had thought it would be a great time to break the safety seal on one of the extinguishers, pull the pin, and give the handle a squeeze. They only did it for perhaps a second, but in doing so they had just forced us to not only crash the show, but we had to evacuate the entire audience as well.

So we marched everyone outside into the parking lot while we tried to air out the demonstration hall. This left us in a shit situation where now the show was ruined, but all the kids, parental chaperones, and teachers were stuck in the parking lot because the busses wouldn’t be back for another forty-five minutes.

How do you fix this? What would you do? These moments will sneak up on you as you go through life. You will face a moment when the world falls to shit and all the plans fail. Airplane pilots spend years in training and get paid serious piles of money, yet spend most of their time sitting on their ass and flirting with the flight attendants while things go on, perfectly fine.

The reason that pilots are paid so well is because they retain and re-train these skills for the rare moments that things don’t go according to plan. Because of this, they can be calm and calculating in times of crisis. Even those flight attendants that you may think of as nothing more than a waitress with wings are actually highly trained professionals that can empty that lounge on wings in a matter of seconds if necessary and save hundreds of lives in the process.

Anyone can be a hero when things go according to plan, it’s having the skills to fix the situation when shit goes sideways that will make you dependable and desirable.

I put on my jacket, grabbed a yoyo, and walked outside with the students.

For forty-five minutes, with nothing more than a yoyo, I was able to keep everyone calm, happy, and entertained while still giving a science demonstration. We talked about inertia, friction, centripetal force, momentum, tensile strength, biomechanics, and even the circulatory system and repetitive stress injuries.

It turns out you can learn a lot from a yoyo.

With nothing more than a kid’s toy I was able to salvage the show and save the field trip. In the coming week, I got letters and cards from the classrooms, teachers, and parents expressing their amazement and apologizing for the crisis-causing kid. The whole event was a pivotal moment in establishing our reputation as a great place for a field trip, not because of all of the amazing demonstrations, but because of one weirdo with a yoyo.

The only reason I was able to do that was because I’d worked to fill my mental toolbox. I’d developed the mentality of “Improvise, Adapt, and Overcome,” and I’d spent a little time learning the basics of how to use a yoyo. I didn’t learn any advanced tricks, but just knowing the basics was enough to intelligently speak about how it worked and explain the science behind it. If you carry a lot in your mental toolbox, you can get by with very little in your hands.

Keep this in mind the next time you’re strolling through the tool section of your local big-box store. You can spend a lifetime’s wages filling a workshop with power tools, but make sure to spend some time as well as dollars. Explore, read, study, and see just how much you can pack between your ears.

There’s so much to learn, and you’re capable of such remarkable things.

Be the person that saves someone’s day when things go sideways.

I've worked my ass off to continue learning and be good at what I do. I spend quite a bit of my own money on online courses, books, assistive software, etc. All to help me do my job better....I've tried to get them to pay for it, they won't.

Last month, I paid nearly $2,000 out of pocket on training classes. I asked my company if I could attend the class while on the clock, and was essentially told no. They said I could attend, as long as it doesn't interrupt my work, which, for this type of class, would mean I might as well not even go if I can't fully pay attention.

Mind you, my PTO hours are maxed out and stopped accruing months ago and I haven't taken a day off in quite a while. So I could have just requested the day off, but I figured I would ask and see if they'd be willing to let me attend on the clock. So not only did I pay for it myself, but they can't even let me attend a class on the clock, which will in turn help me do my job better. They also push back any time I ask for them to pay for software I can use to help me do my job. So I end up paying for it myself.

Every week it seems I take on more and more responsibilities, many of them being way outside of my job description, requiring me to spend a lot of my personal time studying and learning how whatever it is works, reading documentation, watching videos, etc.

I would consider myself, at minimum, on par (in regards to workload and knowledge) with all of my co-workers around me who are considered ""Senior Developers"".

I was promoted to ""Developer"" just over 5 years ago.

My last performance review was for 2018...no review for 2019, or 2020 (I highly doubt we will have one). Not to mention, we are supposed to have quarterly reviews. But those randomly stopped for no reason after 2019 Q2.

My last raise was for 3%, and the ONLY reason I was even given a raise is because CA has a state minimum for exempt salary software developers. So they raised my salary to the California minimum exactly to the dollar. So despite having impressive marks in all categories on my 2018 review, I still only received the legal minimum for my salary increase a month later.

Since my last raise/review...I have requested to be promoted to a senior developer 3 times.

The first time was with my supervisor (the systems architect) and the director of IT. Both of them equally agreed I was more than qualified to be promoted and they would start the paperwork...And then, a few months later...corporate decided to close our office. Laying off everyone in the building (except for a select few).

As part of this, they offered for me to stay on as a remote employee, as I was deemed essential to supporting our software. I countered their offer saying I would stay on if I was promoted to a senior developer. However, I was told they were blocking all counter-offers (which I verified with all others who also countered and they too were told no). So I was told my promotion could not be considered until the beginning of the following year (2020).

I decided to stay anyway, the idea of working from home seemed nice, and it would give me more time to job hunt. And then COVID hit, and it turned out to be a godsend (EDIT: working from home was the godsend...not COVID, just want to make that clear, lol).

I waited 10 months, and then sent another message asking about the promotion. And was again told we're still on a hiring freeze.

It's been 4 months since that last request, and still nothing.

I think I've given them plenty of opportunities to follow through, even despite COVID. It's no wonder I'm no longer happy working at this company.",2020-12-28 21:52:36
"A message from the Emergency Broadcast System, and Sabre-Toothed Fire-Breathing crotch crickets. Life in radio.",73,klh88h,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/klh88h/a_message_from_the_emergency_broadcast_system_and/,14,1609122517.0,"I fucking love the power of swearing. I was raised in the blue-collar world of construction workers, railroad workers, Emergency Medicine, and championship alcoholics. These motherfuckers know how to swear at an Olympic level. It’s in my genes.

However, my family wreath has given rise to a great dichotomy. This spectacular chasm of polarized contrariety throughout my professional life has allowed me to develop a skill that some of my close friends consider a minor superpower.

Because despite my innate and comfortable ability to embrace the power of the “colorful metaphor” as Spock once called it, my career choices have almost universally had me at odds with my colorful language. I’ve spent my entire life On Air, on camera, or in front of a crowd that often includes not only the wee precious children, but their tight-assed helicopter parents as well.

As a result of that, I’ve developed a remarkable level of control of my tongue. The moment it’s time to go live, I can simply turn it off.

What most of my friends don’t know, is that there’s a reason for that. It was a powerful lesson I learned at the tender age of 17. It’s not a superpower; it’s a scar in my brain.

This is the story of that lesson.

I have always been a weirdo, and I got an early start. I was an outcast teenager and spent the majority of my time alone in my basement bedroom. A room that consisted of a twin-sized bed, a chest-of-drawers, and the remainder was filled with a sedimentary mountain of audio equipment. It ran the entire spectrum from professional broadcast and studio gear to “mom’s old stereo,” and it was perched on homemade shelves, a couple dilapidated old desks, and a table that in a former life was a kitchen door -two houses ago.

I had acquired all of this over years of diligent scrounging. My first real mixing console came from the one and only music store that ever graced downtown Coopersville. I paid $100 for it, and the owner of the store had no idea it had taken me months of pushing a broom at the local feed mill to save up that much. Both the mill and the music store are long since gone, but the owner of that store and I are friends to this day.

I crossed the line into having a “real studio” once I could do actual multi-track recording. A dear friend gifted me a gigantic TEAC four-track reel-to-reel tape deck that weighed nearly as much as I did. His friendship, and that old tape deck, are still treasures to me today. Though technology has grown by leaps and bounds, and today I record on hard drives, that old tape deck still works, and has held a place of honor in every studio I’ve owned across my entire life. It’s been used in some part, however small, on every album that’s ever been recorded, by every single band that’s ever worked in one of my studios.

But it all started out in my bedroom “studio”. Thanks to a nearby university scene, I produced a million basic “demo tapes” for local bands that nobody has ever heard of. I recorded Station ID’s for all the tiny,  low-budget radio stations that I could make a friend at. For the first year or so I did all the work for free. Partly because I wanted to build a resume and experience, and mainly because I really had no idea what the hell I was doing.

I got better, quickly, and started doing Bumpers and PSA’s. I even got to start doing work for a few slightly larger stations, ones that people actually listened to. There’s a million things that get played on the radio that aren’t music. Most of these things are the boring, administrative side of radio and are usually made in-house at the station. Typically the people who do it for a living view them as a chore to produce and would rather be doing the “real” part of their job, which was usually being an On-Air jock. I had a pretty awesome time getting minuscule amounts of money to produce a ton of things that nobody wanted to make anyway.

I did it for everyone I could get to answer a phone. Some people hired me based on the fact that I worked for practically nothing, but most did it because I was a fourteen-year-old kid, and they just wanted to be kind and give me a shot. I was thrilled to be doing real studio work, and it sure as hell beat pushing a broom at the feed mill.

I remember the exact, magical moment I first heard my own voice on the radio. I was riding in the van to school (yeah, I was one of those short-bus kids). The driver was an incredibly beautiful young woman with a blonde pixie cut. She used to play Top-40 music because we all liked it, and it kept us quiet on the long drive.

The clock swept the bottom of the hour. Just for a moment, as Aerosmith faded out and in the instant before the commercial started, the whole van was surprised to hear my voice say “One Oh Four Point Five, The New Sunny FM! WSNX, Holland, Grand Rapids”. I let out a squeal like I had just won a Grammy. The driver turned to look at me and said “That was you?!” I was thrilled. I WAS ON THE RADIO!

I earned my “Golden Ticket” shortly after my fifteenth birthday. At the time, I was the youngest person in the USA to hold one, though my record has long since been shattered and I believe the current record holder is actually a five-year-old in LA.

I have no idea how the system works these days, but way back then you needed an actual federal license to be a Disc Jockey and be allowed to talk on the radio. It’s a yellow piece of paper, the same shape and a bit bigger than a dollar bill that says “Federal Communications Commission Radiotelephone Operator Permit”. They weren’t hard to get. The “test” was quite possibly written by the station manager himself and the hardest question on it was trying to remember the date. I’m sure it was just a basic matter of course for everyone who signed up as a DJ to get one, but to me you’d have thought it was a Ph.D. for as proud as I was of having earned it.

My Mom framed it, because that’s what Mom’s do.

I got an unpaid gig doing an evening show on a tiny 100 Watt low-band, nonprofit FM station that had just moved into their “big new studio”. The new studio had one On-Air booth, a lobby just big enough for four people to stand in, an indoor outhouse, and a manager’s office that I never once saw anyone occupy. The whole place was various shades of ugly 70’s brown and could have passed for a tired Dentist’s office if it wasn’t for all the stale cigarette smoke that emanated from the walls.

Their previous studio had been a closet in a building downtown, and you had to do your shows with the door open. You had to keep your stack of records on the floor in the hall because there wasn’t enough room inside. I got lucky and never saw the old place. I was one of the first on the team for the new studio. They had just expanded their hours and would take anyone with a pulse, so I qualified.

The booth was comfortable and familiar. Everything that was “professional” grade was twenty years old. All of the nice new stuff looked like it came from someone’s home stereo. It was a motley collection of mismatched garbage held together with questionable engineering. The whole place was made with dodgy soldering and random unlabeled Radio Shack project boxes that did God knows what. My bedroom studio was more well equipped.

The room was about twelve feet square. The West wall had the door and a big window that looked out into the dark lobby. The only other window was on the East wall, and just featured a parking lot of the place next door. Inside, the booth was dominated by a pair of large old desks arranged in an L. The main console sitting in the middle of the left desk, facing a featureless wall of brown fake wood paneling and a small TV mounted up near the ceiling that was supposed to be showing the weather channel.

The main console was an antique behemoth with a single row of big rotary knobs and a handful of switches that usually worked, most of the time. It was flanked by a stack of gear on either side, cassette decks, CD players, and Cart machines. Everything was in pairs so that you could cue things up while live and ping-pong back and forth.

To the right, under the outside window, was the second desk. It held a pair of turntables that were old enough to be my grandparents’. To the right of that, sitting in the corner, was a proper 19-inch equipment rack that was taller than I was. The rack held the uplink to the transmitter, the Emergency Broadcast box, and a pair of three ring binders, one red, the other white.

The white book was the transmitter log. We had to pick up the phone every few hours and call the transmitter, which was located in the bottom of a water tower a few miles away. You gave it a gentle touch of tones, and a robotic voice would tell you the numbers for things like how many watts of power you were broadcasting at that moment. It was the duty of the DJ to record these numbers diligently, so that they could go in the book and never be read by anyone ever again.

The red book was the Emergency Broadcast System manual. In the event of nuclear war or tornadoes, it would tell you exactly what to do for the last five minutes of your life.

Cascading to the floor and joining the back of both desks was a black waterfall of tangled cables that all looked the same. God have mercy on anyone who disturbed the cable monster.

The fact that any of it worked at all was a miracle, and only the “engineer” who built it had any clue HOW it worked. But through a long chain of magic and physics, when I pressed the play button on the CD player sitting here, a whole city of people and I could listen to the music together.

I was enchanted.

My show ran Tuesday nights from Midnight to 2AM, because I was the FNG (Fuckin’ New Guy) and got the slot that nobody else would take. I didn’t care. I was the last show on the air at night. Nobody actually told me that I had to shut the station down on schedule, and that meant that I could run as long as I wanted. My actual showtime usually ran until dawn when Al would come in and start his shift, a Jewish morning show called “Hatikva!” at 7am. It gave me just enough time to pack up my milk crate of tapes and CDs and get to school before class started.

It wasn’t long before I had worked out a solid groove and was absolutely comfortable on my long nights of being a fifteen-year-old kid completely in charge of an entire radio station. The only time I ever saw anyone else at the station was if one of my weirdo friends came to hang out. Usually they were all sound asleep while I kept the gas station clerks, third-shift factory workers, and tow truck drivers mildly entertained and jamming through the night.

I had no format, style, or shtick. My entire show consisted of playing whatever music I felt like from my own massive collection of CD’s, and talking about the music, the stories behind the bands and the songs. I have an encyclopedic, and fundamentally useless knowledge of music. I played the stuff that I liked, and taught the things that I knew. My brother-in-law, Tony came up with the name of my show. We called it The Molotov Cocktail Hour, and it fit.

I never really cared who, or how many, actually listened. I was talking to the whole city, or at least the tiny fraction of people who were awake. My show was never promoted, and I never did any marketing except for the one time when I accidentally printed forty-thousand business cards and passed them out to everyone I could. It was simple, and there was a purity to the performance. Just a kid who was sharing his passion with anyone who cared to listen.

My show did well, and my audience steadily grew. We didn’t have ratings or anything, and I measured my viewership by how many phone calls I got during the show. This was long before anyone outside of a research lab had email, so people had to actually call me if they wanted to talk.

I held my steady time slot (because nobody else was dumb enough to ever want the graveyard shift) and had a ton of fun. I would take chances and do things no other DJ was doing. Having such a long show let me do things like play an entire album with no breaks, and then spend the next hour talking about it’s history, the band, the recording process, and all the little trivia that went with it. People loved it, and I became a staple among the third shift factory workers of the Westside.

I also became popular with local music nerds for a cool reason. This was back when people got a lot of new music by recording it off the radio, and I had a strict personal rule about never talking over the song I was playing. I kept a specific CD playing for voice over music and would switch to that whenever I was talking. This made it possible for people to actually record music from my show, without my dumbass voice talking over the end of it. It’s a simple thing, but wow did I get a ton of phone calls thanking me for doing it.

The best thing about working overnights in a shitty little radio station is that nothing ever happens. Except for the occasional visit from one of my weirdo friends or lovers, I never saw anyone until morning. It was dead quiet all night, and we were on the outskirts of town so there wasn’t even any traffic. It was incredibly quiet and peaceful.

Most of the time.

I was seventeen, it was shortly after Midnight, and the rain outside was Vanilla Sex; fucking near horizontal. The window was rattling enough that you could hear it through my microphone. I was expecting the power to go out anytime and was playing “Big Generator” by Yes and making the best of a bad situation.

That’s when the world exploded.

Just above and behind my right ear the Emergency Broadcast System box started screeching with the full-throated wild abandon of an autistic kid who just had his juice box snatched. If I ever meet the cocksucker who thought it was a good idea to rackmount a 120 decibel alarm horn four feet from the DJ’s ears, I’m going to wrap my dick around his neck and try to drop-start him like a fucking chainsaw.

The real problem wasn’t that the box scared the living shit out of me, launching me out of my chair and onto my feet, ready to run out of the room in a moment of pure adrenaline and fear. No.

It was that I was between songs, talking live on the air when it happened.

In times of extreme duress people instantly drop to the language of their upbringing. This is especially true for immigrants and on-air talent. I am no exception. Without a moment’s reservation or hesitation I brought forth a superlative string of expletives and invectives that would have every tightass, conservative biddy in the women’s auxiliary clutching her pearls and blushing so hard she’d have a stroke right there at the bridge table.

I regained my composure after a few seconds, pulled the binder off the rack, followed the EBS instructions to the letter, and was suspended for 30-days even before the fifteen-minute-long Tornado Warning had cleared. Big Al the station manager was pissed, and I was heartbroken.

My fellow jocks however, are not without a sense of humor. A universal truth about DJ’s is that they’re widely regarded as assholes - it comes with the job. If over the course of your life you’ve had more than five people begin a fight by saying “I’ll bet you think you’re fucking funny, don’t ya?” it’s probably a good idea to put together a tape and a resume. You’re most likely DJ material.

Now, every one of my listeners heard my ten seconds of “WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT!”. The substitute who filled my time slot the next week could have easily said “Chris was suspended for a month for swearing on the air, you’re stuck with me for a few weeks.” and gone on with his day.

But no, of course he didn’t do that.

Because he wasn’t just the typical asshole late night DJ. This was a guy who had a personality that washed over you like an unwelcome wave of sweat when you’re having a bad, late-night shit. He got on the air, opened my show, and proceeded to tell my entire listening audience that I had died in a car crash.

Because he’s a cunt.

Now, all my friends knew better, so that was no problem. My parent’s phone wasn’t in the phone book. Remember, this was before the internet was a thing, people used phone books, not Google.

My grandparents’ number however, was the only listed number with my last name anywhere in the county.

My sainted, patient, meek grandmother completely lost her fucking mind when people started calling her with condolences. Several people even sent her flowers. She had herself well and truly un-fucking-hinged by the time she called my parents (a total of about five minutes after the flowers and phone calls started the next morning after the show).

Once she found out I was alive and well, she was absolutely prepared to kill me with her bare hands. Even years later, she thought this was some stupid stunt I pulled, and she never believed me when I told her I had nothing to do with it.

Even at the station people sent in cards and letters, a couple people sent in mix tapes. It would appear the dorky kid on the radio all night long was more popular than I (and Al) had ever imagined.

I had to call Al and explain the situation to him. Al was more pissed at the other guy for what he pulled than he was at me for swearing on the air. At least I had an understandable reason for my actions. Al taught me a valuable lesson about good management, learn the difference between when you have a problem, and when your boss has a problem. Asshole DJ wasn’t my problem, he was Al’s.

Al was…..displeased. He told me that he’d handle it, and he did in his characteristic style.

After a conversation that I would have bought tickets to hear, Al fired the Asshole DJ. He put me back on the air (two weeks early!), and now not only did I have my usual time slot, I had his as well! I was ecstatic, because now I had a whole two nights a week!

I began my first show in his slot by informing the world that he was suffering from a debilitating bout of sabre-toothed fire-breathing crotch crickets and would be gone for the foreseeable future.

Payback is a bitch. But you can bet your fuckin’ ass I never swore on the radio again.",2020-12-28 04:28:37
How I got fired 4 times from tech jobs,93,kk08h2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/kk08h2/how_i_got_fired_4_times_from_tech_jobs/,5,1608908186.0,"Heya everyone, 

So my experience is as follows, every time I join a company and my manager get fired, my days gets numbered shortly after. 

Job # 1, I joined the company to do development work, it wasn’t easy to get it, I had an interview with 5 technical people who tried to grill me, but I end up getting it. 

11 months later, my manager left for another job, new manager got hired and shortly I got fired for absolutely no reason, they told me it wasn’t performance related, they wanted to restructure. 

Job #2, joined another tech company, 3 years later, my manager got fired, 2 weeks later I was let go, also they told me it wasn’t performance related, they wanted to restructure lol 

Job #3 joined another tech company “money transfer business”, two years later the project I’m worked on completed, I was assigned to report to new manager who also fired me, so I’m told things got messy after and the person who let me go was fired 3 months later. 

Job #4 I joined insurance company, difficult interview, but I got the job, 2 years later, manager left for another company, and I got let go shortly after also they wouldn’t provide me with any reason. 

Wtf ... I know this has happened over the years, and I delivered on every project I worked on, yet that’s how I get treated. 😕",2020-12-25 16:56:26

I'll let you speculate which one. My role was to help 5 executives, including the CEO, to book travel and other nuances.

Around this time of year, I was sending company holiday cards when my boss asked me to pick up her dry cleaning, so I left for an hour to do that and grab lunch. When I got back, the cards were gone. I stuffed them in a folder marked ""Holiday Cards"" and they were for our clients. 

Well, my boss is an idiot and in the short time I was gone, she somehow mailed 20 of the company holiday cards to her family! In full transparency, I asked her about the cards and told her to open one. Instead of being embarrassed, she was mad at me for leaving them on my desk? 

Looking back, I really stood up for myself. I said, ""Why would I have your family holiday cards when you never gave them to me? I'm only responsible for sending the holiday cards for the company."" She fired me on the spot and I stormed out. A few days later, I got a call from the nice CEO apologizing and offering me to come back, but I decided to accept an offer I had been sitting on to become an engineer instead. 

It turns out that place a total mess now, and on the verge of bankruptcy. Not going to lie, it was scary to join tech as a junior engineer and I had a really hard time keeping up. But if I had stayed in that Executive Assistant role, I'd still be in the same position today. I'm now an engineering manager. Anyways, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone!

Of course, it's dark, so I'd usually ask if they want me to turn on the lights.

So, I shout across the room, ""Sysco!""

I pause. I'm standing in a dark corner, I don't think he can see me, or even if he is looking up. I'm just a voice in the dark.

I said, ""Did you bring cookies?!""

He says, ""Nope.""

I say, ""Sysco always brought cookies.""

He says, ""Okay"", like, 'I'm outta here, too weird.'

Many of them came from large cities in California (we were not located on CA- kids were sent to us because rules regarding restraining kids in our state was not as strict. It’s basically not allowed in CA except police, dentition centers & hospitals). Many of these girls had behavior problems & had been running the streets & committing crimes for years. As they were doing whatever they wanted most missed a lot of school. Once during black history month we (staff) wanted an easy, calm night & found a relevant movie on Netflix. We decided upon Malcolm X as the beginning of the movie his life is similar to many of the girls- crime, prison, etc & he turned his around. Anywayyyyyss we announce the movie to them and are about to give them more info about it when a 17 year old girl raises her hand & very seriously asks ‘what’s a Malcolm X?’. This happened about 10 years ago but I will never forget it. She was so serious too. Like Malcolm X is not an ‘a’ he is a person. It’s funny as it’s sad.

During the pandemic, our department has been closed, open, mostly closed, kinda open, closed...it's been all over the place. I mostly work from home, as do many of the other employees who can do so. We hired a new director DURING this weird time, so she hasn't actually met most of the city employees who work under her. 

So today, there was an online all-hands Microsoft Teams meeting that was intended as kind of a meet and greet. She had us all go around and introduce ourselves and we did some online icebreakers -- it was kind of pointless, but whatever, we were being paid for it, and it was nice to see everyone. It was the *whole* department, though, not just my sub-department, so I didn't know most of the people on the call. And one of the people on the call...

I don't know who he was or which sub-department he worked for, but he spent the first half hour of the meeting eating Freeze Pops. One after another. So many Freeze Pops. My co-workers and I kept up a running commentary on Freeze Pop Man in our Slack, counting the Freeze Pops as he ate them. Once he had eaten *five* Freeze Pops in the first fifteen minutes of the meeting, we figured he was done. Then he got up, and returned wearing a sweater and holding a connected sheet of *four more Freeze Pops* (all orange ones, if you were curious). We're losing our shit in the Slack channel now, all like, dude, if you have to put on a sweater, maybe you should *stop eating Freeze Pops.*

He consumed those other Freeze Pops pretty quickly, but we figured he was done until he pulled from (nowhere?) another blue Freeze Pop. And then another. And another. All told, this man ate 12 Freeze Pops in the first 35 minutes of our meeting. It was amazing. And hilarious. And I salute him.

Company's Negligent Attitude Concerning COVID Could Really Harm Employees!,49,kf6igj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/kf6igj/companys_negligent_attitude_concerning_covid/,6,1608239900.0,"Please note, looking where to share this story as I feel my company should be held accountable for their poor behavior.    I originally posted this on glass-door.  The review was up for three weeks until it somehow disappeared.  I worked in the semiconductor industry for Lam Research in America.   At the onset of China's COVID-19 outbreak, in mid-January 2020, I was given 24 hours notice to travel to China for a customer escalation.  US news had not yet reported the virus.  I was not made aware of a viral outbreak until I arrived in China as all of the Chinese-based Lam employees knew about it.  While there, I was not told any preventative measures and not supplied any safety equipment except given a face mask, when I requested one, for my trip back to America.  Once I left China after fulfilling my obligation to my manager to stay a week -- as well as for safety reasons -- management told me I should still be in China regardless of the outbreak.  This was despite management's promise to handle the escalation in China after I left.  Management, however, decided to spin the story to our VP that I'd stay longer and that me leaving was a sign that I'm not committed to the customer or the business.  It gets worse.  I was told not to quarantine despite asking and, a week after my return, two close coworkers displayed COVID-19-like symptoms and both were out for over a week.  HR is ineffective in these matters by stating management shouldn't have asked me to stay in China yet the managers responsible for this harmful decision still manage people.  HR has further stated no one could have known the severity of this virus citing ""a 2015 Ebola scare that didn't amount to much"" yet neglect -- and refuse to discuss -- previous outbreaks such as SARS and H1N1.  Additionally, HR said that my co-workers potentially catching the virus is pure speculation since there was no official COVID-19 test.  These events happened in early Feb 2020 before we had any COVID-19 tests or started our lock downs.  This seems outright negligent and irresponsible!  Important lessons can be learned that seem to be ignored.",2020-12-17 23:18:20

We do not discuss any of topics in my title to save us grief and disrupting our relationship with patients. This rule applies to our employees and honestly, it’s better that way.

It’s already stressful being there, due to the workload, it is *loads* better to not have the heavy burden of any of the above topics looming over us until we’re clocked out.

I was given a tougher, older patient who is notorious for going on tangents about ALL of the above topics. Personally, I ignore things pretty well and don’t hesitate to change the conversation on uncomfortable subjects or pretend I never heard it and carry on with what I was originally saying.

Patient A was not having it.

We begin the apppintment, ask our routine Covid questions, check vitals, proceed to appointment. We are in full PPE. Patients can take their mask off in the dental chair and must put it on if they leave the chair for whatever reason.

Patient A begins to scoff and laugh as I remind them to wash their hands before coming into the room and get a temperature check.

“As if that’ll tell you I have COVID! It just tells you if I’m hot or cold.” Yes, that’s correct - but if you’re running above 99, then I have every right to stop what I’m doing and tell my higher ups.

Patient A takes mask off and wants to go the bathroom. I remind them they must have a mask on at all times unless sitting in the chair. They begrudgingly comply and tries to take it off again before sitting down, but I stop them to check vitals and *then* have them sit.

The entire time I’m doing their polish, Patient A *has* to take breaks to inform me that Covid is a poison of the mind and we’re all succumbing to it. I’m suffering because I’m protecting myself. We as a society shouldn’t be such sheep to government entities. If I just believe in God, I’ll be saved.

Each time they would speak, I would need to suction the back of their mouth because of how much saliva would pool and my face shield was becoming dirty by how much spittle flew up as they complained about Covid and how much it sucks to not see people’s faces.

The entire time, I kept quiet. Not responding. Not nodding. Not paying attention to the words. They repeatedly asked my opinion while I told them to turn their head toward me for a better angle. They asked if I even knew what my co-workers looked like anymore. I didn’t respond.

When the doctor came in, the tangent started right back up. Doctor was more responsive but still didn’t engage, moving the patient back to do their evaluation.

Once patient’s appointment was complete and I walked them up front, they began chastising me for not responding to any of their questions. NONE of them were dental related.

I let them know I wish they had a good day and left promptly to get ready for my next patient. I don’t care if they come back or not. I don’t care how much money the bring in. It really doesn’t matter to me.

At this point, I know my side in history: Covid is real and it has killed thousands upon thousands of others. I don’t need to argue with others at work to justify that when it has literally happened.",2020-12-04 04:56:54
Tourism in a rural area,31,k5abd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/k5abd0/tourism_in_a_rural_area/,1,1606919753.0,"This isn't one specific anecdote, more of a rant on how bad my last workplace was organized.

I've worked in two tourist offices (in France). The first one functions as a private company, even if it receives order from local elected officials. Lots of specialized employees trusted to do their job.

The second one, which I recently left, is handled directly by the local government (""Communauté de Communes"", one level above municipality). I was one of only two employees dedicated to the Tourist Office. Our bosses and the accountant have many other things to deal with.

So we had a lot of work. What could already be a full time job for the two of us is manning the frontdesk at two different locations. It serves no purpose to have two, so close to each other, but politics : each mayor would watch the world burn before his location is closed.

On top of that the job includes :

* creating the brochures and distributing them in a 50 km radius

* Inputing the data on all accommodations, restaurants and events in the regional database

* Updating the website (I also translated it to english)

* Guided tours and hikes

* Renting electric bikes (and maintaining them)

* Being present at major events in the area, and at conventions across the country

* Maintaining the markings on the hiking trails

* Ordering and accounting for the souvenir shop (no cash register by the way, all done on good ol' MS Excel)

* Answering journalists questions and babysitting them around the area

* And sometimes we were called to help for other events that had nothing to do with tourism.

My former colleague and I are both Art History major, him a masters degree and me a BA (recruited for the guided tours, barely ever had time to do any). We were payed barely above minimum wage. The many many extra hours are not paid, we have to hopefully find days in the off season to offload them.

When we obviously have to close at least one frontdesk to tend to another task, the mayor (and the tourists) complain. When we miss an event or delay a task to keep the front desk open, everyone complains that we just sit on our butts.

We had many meetings (during opening hours, obviously) with our boss and the elected officials to improve the situation. The solution is clear. Either hire more people, close one location, or abandon several tasks. But they can't agree on anything. So it goes on ... well without me.

I glossed other many details. Work hours, vacations, accounting, contracts, and many other things were so badly handled that it could probably bury them in legal troubles if it was actually checked.",2020-12-02 16:35:53

(Box trucks with metal shelves on the inside, sometimes I unload rental trucks tho, like uhaul, penske, budget, etc.) I also work in the back of the building unloading oversized and overweight packages by hand.

Recently I've noticed that my coworkers would either a:show up late b: not show up at all c: go home early claiming to be sick d: go home early without saying anything. Since I'm the one in my area who has almost perfect attendance through the almost 4 years I've worked at this company, I usually have to be the one doing my coworker's job plus doing my job as well. Not only is it annoying to finish my work for the night and find out that there's more work after I finish because my coworkers decided to skip work again, but also as a result I've threw out my lower back from doing so much damn work.

Neither my part time supervisor, my full time supervisor, nor my manager seem to give a flying crap about my coworker's lack of attendance. 

Eventually I was talking to one of my coworkers during break, and he told me "", one way I like to get out of work early is to stick my finger in my throat and cause myself to throw up on purpose."" I looked at him and asked him "", how often do you do that? Does anyone else here do that?"" He then says "", I do it almost every day, and so does everyone one else, even the supervisors know we do this, and they never say anything about it, they'll usually just find someone else to cover for me anyways."" He obviously didn't know that I'm the one covering up for him. 

I'm really tempted to quit my job after hearing this, but I don't want to give up the $14.8 an hour plus benefits. Plus I hope to move up and drive for this company. Until then I'm just gonna have to tolerate doing my lazy ass coworker's job, while dealing with a sore back, while having my supervisor ride my ass constantly while not giving a flying rat's ass about my coworkers, all while we have peak season coming up next week.

What are you going to do anyway on “ALL” those Saturdays off.. I mean really?,73,k1nbk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/k1nbk9/what_are_you_going_to_do_anyway_on_all_those/,17,1606424509.0,"This is a follow up to my “Stop stealing my Parking place story” I didn't think this is really malicious compliance but more of a small victory. It might be a stretch but I couldn think of where to put it and I had a few requests for a follow up.

Here is the parking place story and this took place a few years later -[https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/k1j98f/stop\_stealing\_my\_assigned\_parking\_place/gdp7qpm/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/k1j98f/stop_stealing_my_assigned_parking_place/gdp7qpm/?context=3)

So I had been working at this large dealership. I liked my job and my co workers, the only real issue was the Saturday schedule. Initially it started out as an 8-12 every 3rd weekend then every other and then every other Saturday from 7:30 to 5 so essentially another full day every other week.

Maybe that’s your thing, and you don’t find it a big deal but we were already working 7:30-5:30 M-F and this added 2-3 full days a month without any other compensation.

The end result was everything you need to do on the weekend HAS to get done on your one day off and by the following Saturday I was pretty burnt out. Especially as I was I heavy line mechanic so it was a pretty physical job.

Back to the story. At the time the manufacturer (but will remain nameless) was requiring the dealers to get their technician/mechanics trained to a certain standard. This require the dealer to send us off site to a training facility so we were gone for multiple days and it was a double hit financially as they had to pay for the class, pay us to go and we didn’t earn anything for the dealer. Getting the certification require many many trips to class.

So for the time I was there I had been going to classes and also talking to them about somehow rescheduling the week so maybe we could only have to work every third Saturday Not a bog ask I thought.

Anyway time goes by and I was approached by a former co worker telling me that the dealer down the street wants to talk to me as they are in need of someone with my certifications as the former service manager had been short sighted in getting his people trained.

The money wasn’t going to be different but they would pay to move my tools, offered vacation time from day one and the icing on the cake would be No Saturdays.

I told him I was interested but could he wait a few weeks as the dealer I worked at gave out year end bonus’s and I wanted to collect on mine before I left as I felt I earned it working for 10 1/2 months of the year.

I waited to give my 2 weeks so I would leave right after Christmas and was sure to get the bonus.

Here is were the petty revenge comes in.

A few days before I was set to leave I get called up to the General Managers office for a “talk” I knew this was going to happen as a last chance effort to get me to stay. The conversation went on for 45 minutes but Ill just give the highlights. Cast of characters is just GM and Me and like I said my only real issue was Saturdays.

GM So I understand your’e leaving and I was hoping to convince you to stay.

ME. The only issue Ive had is the Saturday schedule and as we’ve talked about this before your stance was its not going to change so my only option is to leave.

GM I don’t get it. Im here almost every Saturday and a lot of Sundays as well and…

Me I cut him off saying “ We’re not in the same playing field here. If I made your money, got your perks, got to take “Business Trips” to play golf in Hawaii or Phoenix, I would work those hours too but we don’t so here we are.”

GM Still what are you going to do anyway on “ALL” those Saturdays off.. I mean really?

ME Maybe nothing that’s not the point, If I want to sit in my driveway and spin, trying to compress the sand into diamonds with my ass cheeks that’s my prerogative, as long as Im not here working.

GM Surprised Pikachu face and crickets. …. Well if you change your mind Im here to talk.

If there really is classical revenge I waited until they handed out the bonus for the year and then promptly walked back to my box and left. While me being gone effected the number of qualified people and there was a considerable expense in my leaving. The Gm knew where I was going and called the other dealer and accused him of stealing me and filed a formal complaint against them.",2020-11-26 23:01:49

Karen can’t understand appointments,94,jxvnd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jxvnd1/karen_cant_understand_appointments/,2,1605900363.0,"Just got this one today.

So some time ago I made a grooming appointment for Karen over the phone. I always tell people The soonest available then when I book them I make sure I reiterate the date and time. If they want to get in sooner I put them on a waiting list so if someone cancels they can get in. But I always make sure to say “okay sir/ma’am your appointment is at 0:00 on day of month”

So I made this apt and this morning the woman calls. Here’s how it goes. 

K: hi so someone scheduled me for the 1st but I’m leaving that Monday and my dog needs a grooming and I wanted this coming Tuesday.

Me: okay sorry about that. But it appears we are completely booked for this Tuesday. I can add your name to the waiting list.

K: then what?

Me: if someone cancels they will give you a call. 

K: okay just, someone made a mistake in the date and I need to get him in

Me: I understand. If we get any cancellations, we will let you know. 

Do I figure that’s the end of it. Nope. She just called a few minutes ago. She starts with a ramble that I can barely understand 

K:.....so I need to get in on this Tuesday, got the 1st. 

Me: ma’am so I do have you on the waiting list for this Tuesday as we are completely booked.

K: why did you have me for the 1st at all. I can’t do that date 

Me: I’m not sure ma’am (cause that’s the apt you made with me) 

K: well will there be any cancellations?

Me: I don’t know ma’am (I can’t predict the future)

K: well you just let your boss and the groomer know that a huge mistake was made and my dog needs a grooming 

Me: will do ma’am",2020-11-20 21:26:03
Property management Saga: The beginning.,42,jxonn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jxonn0/property_management_saga_the_beginning/,0,1605877464.0,"Where to even start. I guess a disclaimer. 

Names will be changed. If you know where this is, keep it to yourself. Here goes crazy!

The beginning. 

Worked as a leasing agent in a large city, learned from the best of the best. We moved one state over and to a smaller city. I applied for a Property manager position of 375 units. Not the largest community but definitely the craziest. Been here 2 years. First job as a manager. They were desperate. :)

First day on the job: the outgoing manager would be staying a month to train me before she moves out of state. Her name is Lucy (30’s, little pit bull, always having to defend herself against her insecurities). Lucy will make an appearance quite often in these tales. 

Lucy introduces me to my new maintenance team. Three 20-30 year old guys, 1 older guy, Jerry, who just mows. She tells me the maintenance manager is out on leave due to an accident. We are saving his position for when he returns but in the mean time Chuck (late 30’s, scruffy, country boy without the manners)was promoted to manager. 

Maintenance goes off to do their thing and in walks a police officer. Wants to know who is living in one of the units, they would like to “talk” to him. Nice. Warm welcome. Lucy and the assistant manager Sheila (20’s, newish mom, dating Hugh, been here about 5 months, moved from a neighboring state) word vomit as much information about the resident as possible and off goes the officer. Why are you releasing private information to anyone without a warrant?! I guess they do things different here. 

*faint sirens in the distance*
Lucy: Is that us?
Sheila: (excited tone) They’re (fire truck) turning in!
Lucy: Grab your stuff, let’s go!
Me: ???
Lucy: Let’s go! In my car! We need to see where they’re going.
Sheila: probably unit 50A.

Lucy’s phone rings. She answers it on speaker phone. 

Maintenance man Chuck exclaims, “Do you know where they’re going?!” 
Lucy: No, but follow them!

We arrive at Unit 50A. Sheila won. 

“Crazy Cathy probably faking an illness again.”

Back to the office we go as I question what that was all about. Lucy says the units will go up in flames easily so we need to be diligent if there is a fire and know right away. I think to myself because 3 chicks and a gangly maintenance team are going to turn into fire fighters and save the world? I agree with Lucy because it is my first day.

The rest of the day is filling me in on the gossip, the residents that hate us and Lucy’s relationship with Sheila. The web will start to weave...",2020-11-20 15:04:24

But, for some reason known only to himself, he insisted that I do the label in YIDDISH!.

He is the only one in the shop that knows any Yiddish, and he even had to do some digging to get the correct spelling. I later found out it still was not correct. But even funnier was delivery people coming in would still toss trash in the can constantly.",2020-11-19 00:38:21

I don't make minimum wage but I  just barely make a livable wage. I have mediocre healthcare that costs  me 1/10th of my wages. My husband and I are both Army Veterans. He was  medically retired 10 years ago. He has COPD and 2 years ago he had a  lung spontaneously collapse. Making him a severe risk when it comes to  Covid-19.

Now I know a lot of you want to believe that this pandemic doesn't exist. IT DOES. We are now leading the [world](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)  with 180,000 new cases a day. There have been more than 245,000 deaths  to date. Even if hospitals are over-reporting double, that's still 5  times the [deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) due to Influenza Season 2018-2019. Can we please drop this narrative that its anything like the seasonal flu?

There is now data that a person can be [reinfected](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/reinfection.html). That means [Herd](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301709)  Immunity will not work like you hope it will. If you get sick with  Covid-19, even if you experience mild symptoms, you could have to deal  with [long-term](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351) complications. Our children, who usually suffer mild symptoms, could have to deal with [Cardiovascular](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/can-coronavirus-cause-heart-damage), Respiratory and [Neurological](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-we-know-so-far-about-how-covid-affects-the-nervous-system/) problems for the rest of their lives.

I understand that you believe that masks are a political statement. [They're not](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449).  As the virus surges through our White House, ask if it matters for whom they voted.  All of the medical professionals in the world are screaming  at us to wear a mask. This virus doesn't care if  you voted for Trump,  Biden or Kanye. Your unclad face only tells me that you are selfish.

You  are correct when you say that wearing a mask isn't going to protect  you. You see that masked employee that you are verbally abusing? That  mask that they are wearing is the one that is protecting you. While your  verbal diarrhea could literally be spraying a deadly virus all over  that Essential Person. That person who makes your sandwich, stocks your  food and toilet paper. They run around the store 40 times a day  disinfecting every surface you touch. We wear that mask 8 hours a day, 5  days a week to protect YOU from the deadly virus that is raging out of  control in our country.

We don't  have the option to work from home. Our work is ESSENTIAL. Our population  must eat. You do not need to 'Just Browse'. If you can't wear your mask  due to medical reasons you are likely very susceptible to the Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome that is making it's rounds. You should be  staying at home as much as possible. You are at higher risk of the most  serious symptoms and the death. I'm trying to protect you as much as  possible. We provide [3rd Party](https://peoplesparty.org/) home [delivery](https://www.instacart.com/) and curb-side pick-up. Go Home.

I  have worked every day since this all began. We hunted down 15 vendors  to find you toilet paper, hand sanitizer and cleaning products. We are  working so hard to make sure that our community has the food that we all  require. Our crew has no part-time help. No one wants to work part-time  during a pandemic. Our corporate is making money hand over fist. We're  getting a $250 bonus. We are over-worked with no end in sight. The CDC  is [estimating](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)  another 20-40,000 deaths by December 5th. Then here you are, with NO  MASK upon your face, with the audacity to get mad at me when I ask you  to leave.

You have shown time and  again how little you care for me and my family. I have every right to  get an attitude with you. You are endangering my life and the life of  everyone I love. The most important people in my life, my husband and  child, are put at a health risk every single time you walk into my store  with no mask covering your face. Every naked nose could send me home  with a virus that could literally kill my severely compromised husband.  Each time you invade my space with your face open to the air you are  risking my child's healthy future. Don't glare at me like I have  offended you by backing away from you. You don't have to be [sick](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/20-percent-of-people-with-covid-19-are-asymptomatic-but-can-spread-the-disease#Only-20%-remained-asymptomatic) to pass this horrible virus to your friendly grocery store worker.

Since  March I have been wearing a mask. 8 hours a day. 5 days a week. 8  months. 1,280 hours I have worn a mask to protect you from the deadly  virus that has killed more than 1,000,000 people [worldwide](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=covid+death+worldwide).  It's my right to refuse to serve, assist or allow you within 6ft of me.  It's my right to protect my loved ones from your selfishness. It is not  your right to be a public health hazard.

We  could have a vaccine in April. As early as April. Could be Summertime.  This pandemic is getting worse, NOT better. 6 months at best. Another  6-8 months. That's the entire length of the pandemic so far going into  the worst Respiratory season. Cold and Flu season is upon us once again.  That dreaded season of cough, sniffles and Covid. Just like Covid;  Rhinovirus and Influenza can also be contained by being polite and  wearing a mask. It's up to you not to spread your disease to those  around you.

Oh, how I despise your  stay-at-home order and working from home existentialism. As you stomp  around like a raging toddler with diaper in hand. Screaming at the wage  slave in front of you without a thought in your head for anyone but  yourself. Yet I still go to work and make sure that your favorite brand  is well stocked. My family has to eat after all. The VA sucks for any  real healthcare, so I'd rather not lose my benefits. Especially with a  deadly virus ripping through our populace and tearing through our  medical personnel.

When I see you  walk into my store with your face uncovered, it fills me with rage. I'm only asking that you wear a mask while you shop at your favorite store  for your favorite brand. I am a person. I have the right to live and to  make sure that my family lives. You have the right to not wear a  covering on your face. Just like businesses have the right to deny you  entrance. No Shirt, No Shoes, No Pants, No Mask. Of those, the mask  seems the smallest. Just take a breath, put on the mask and breathe.  You'll be OK and the sooner you figure that out, the safer we'll all be.

We're near the beach and a couple bars, so I'm pretty used to drunk and high people at my job. But these three men were the weirdest customers I've ever encountered in my four summers working there. For context, this happened this past summer.

Most nights, I work in the restaurant, but that night I was working in the prize booth in the arcade. It had been a pretty normal night, nothing crazy yet, except for a person calling a green stuffed panda ""green Pikachu"". Anyway, I had three men in their early 30s walk in. They seem pretty normal. I scan their card, tell them how many tickets they have, and tell them to look around and let me know when they know what they want. They walk around the room for about five minutes, until Man 1 says, ""We should get some of the felt flowers for the milfs out there."" My jaw drops behind my mask. I think, ""Well, this is happening tonight."" Man 2 says, ""Yeah, we'll take one of each color of flower for each milf."" I hand them the flowers. 

They continue to look around. Man 3 then says, ""Let's get a Chinese handcuff"". Man 1 says, ""Why do we need a chinese handcuff?"" Man 3 then says, ""Well, we can give the milf the flower, and then give them the Chinese handcuff. Then the milf won't be able to get out of it when we do it to her."" Alarm sirens begin going off in my head- if they were to actually do something like this, could I be charged for giving them the equipment to do such a thing? I just gave them the handcuff because I didn't know what to do. Finally, man 2 says, ""Finally, we'll get a Tootsie pop for her to suck on."" 

They were finally out of tickets. I then put back on my customer service face, and said, ""Have a nice night."" They then replied, ""Oh, we WILL."" and left.

So yeah, the creepiest customers I've ever had.",2020-11-10 23:58:30

So we do grooming 4 days a week. Not everyone knows that so some people call and ask for a certain day, I tell them the groomers aren’t in that day, they find a different day. Cool. Alls good. Not this man. So it’s Thursday. No groomers. A man calls.

Me: hello this is the pet shop. 

Man: yes I need to get my dog in for grooming today 

Me: I’m sorry man but the groomers aren’t in today but I can put you on the wait list for tmmr

Man: no! I need my dog groom today! We have plans tomorrow!

Me: sorry sir, they aren’t here today and they are completely book for tomorrow morning 

Man: f you then *hangs up*

2nd story 

A woman comes in and gets some dog stuff. So I ring her up and she says “that’s a good price” I just smile and think nothing of it. After I ring her up I go to help other customers. But I soon notice that she’s just standing outside the grooming door for maybe 10 mins at this point. So I ask if she needs anything. She replies “I need my dog”  so I ask for her name and I see she didn’t pay ahead, but she also didn’t tell me she was picking up. Meaning she hasn’t been charged. I tell her she needs to pay first and she goes ballistic claiming she paid. She didn’t. Finally I had to go through the receipt with her to show her she didn’t pay for the grooming.",2020-11-08 20:17:56
"Nope, that's not ""my"" car (anymore)",78,jjp0nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jjp0nh/nope_thats_not_my_car_anymore/,3,1603896193.0,"NOTE: Not sure if this belongs in this subreddit or is there a more appropriate one. Let me know if it's wrong. Maybe /r/pettyrevenge ?

Those of you in the US know that many charities will accept donations of vehicles, running or not. (And for those of you who don't, now you know.) What usually happens is those got moved to a central lot and were auctioned off. Whatever the vehicle is sold for (minus fees for the auctioneer) is credited as your ""donation"" to the charity. And they are legally required to mail you a receipt so you can claim it as an income tax deduction. 

Also, while you can ""buy"" a car, you can take some time to ""register"" a car under your name. Officially buyer has 10 days to transfer title under themselves, and seller has 5 days to report the title transfer to DMV (department of motor vehicles). But the paperwork is a bit lax at charities and auctions, esp. for crappy vehicles. Anyway, onto the story. 

So when my poor car gave up its reverse gear for the second time (the first time I replaced the transmission), and the car by this time is worth less than the transmission it will need, I decided to donate it to a worthy cause. So I drove the vehicle there, got a handwritten receipt, took public transit home, and forgot about it. 

Imagine my surprise three weeks later I got a ""towing charge"" invoice mailed to my home from a company I haven't heard of.  (Remember I said I used to work for a bus company? I know most of the tow truck companies in town, both small and large)  It's just an invoice with one line-item. ""Towing charge"". No details. 

So I called them up and the conversation roughly goes as follows:

Me: Hi, I got an invoice from you, Number (insert here). I have some questions. 

Phone Lady (PL): Let me look that up for you. Yes, I have located the Invoice. Am I speaking to Mr. (my name)?

Me: Yes, that's me. What is this invoice about?

PL: Your vehicle (license plate) was removed from a private property lot in (neighboring city) at the request of the property owner on (date) and (time). When are you going to retrieve the vehicle? 

Me: That is very interesting since I donated that vehicle to (charity name) on (date). so that is no longer my problem. 

PL (sighs, turns robotic): Sir, you are the registered owner of the vehicle. Our yard is storing your vehicle at the rate of (insert figure) per day. Your current amount (insert figure) is on top of that. After (X) days the vehicle will be auctioned and we will invoice you for any outstanding amount. 

Me: I understand that, but I am telling you, that is not ""my"" car anymore. I donated it on (insert date) to (charity). 

PL: Please submit any evidence you have to our corporate address. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Me: Must submit evidence in writing, got it. Thanks, nothing else today. 

So I waited another week, waiting for the receipt to arrive. But a second invoice arrived first. This one has a second line: storage fee, X dollars times Y days = so and so amount. 

Another week, yet another invoice, and finally the ""receipt"" from the charity arrived. It has the donation date, the auction date, and the yielded amount. 

$80 USD. 

That's right, my poor car is worth only $80 USD. Oh well. Not my problem. 

I promptly made a copy of the receipt, then underlined the received date three times in red, then for extra pettiness, drew a circle on what the vehicle's worth.   (Let's just say invoice #3 is showing a figure 5x-10x the vehicle's worth, I don't remember exactly. )

I promptly wrote them a nice letter in very nice words basically telling them to pound sand, not my car, not my problem. 

And for extra pettiness, I put ""attention: accounts receivable"" on the envelope (and their address), then went to the post office and did the whole registered mail with delivery confirmation, so there's no denying ever receiving it. 

Never did hear back from them. 


P.S. I figure what happened was whoever bought my vehicle didn't notice it didn't have a reverse gear. It looked as if it's worth a bit more than that (the brand is reliable, and engine was fine). But when he realized the vehicle is worthless without repair, he basically abandoned it and never transferred the title under his name. The towing company then decided to invoice me as I am officially still the registered owner. Not really their fault, they probably heard all sorts of sorry excuses. But again, not my problem.",2020-10-28 16:43:13
I climbed under the bus a dozen times because my boss is a cheapskate,80,jj41ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jj41ly/i_climbed_under_the_bus_a_dozen_times_because_my/,8,1603814946.0,"I've mentioned that I once worked for a bus charter company. The problem is my boss was a total cheapskate. And this is one of the stories where he treats people like dirt instead of spending money. 

One of the buses developed a problem: after driving a certain number of miles, it loses its gear. It has an automatic transmission, so this is obviously internal, nothing we can do about it except take it to a transmission shop.  And since it's not really drivable, it should have been towed. 

Not to my boss. 

He grabbed the backup bus and got me to follow in my car to follow him up to the disabled bus. The existing driver took the backup bus, transferred the passengers and left, leaving the ""broken"" bus and us behind, and my own car on the side of the highway.  Highway patrol already came by and asked us to call a tow... or they'll call one for us. 

So my boss jumped into the bus and tried to start it. It won't start. Nothing from the starter. 

I climbed under the bus. Looks like the ground wire had came loose from the starter, so incomplete circuit. But a starter in a bus is like 100 lbs, I kid you not. I don't have to tools to remove it, redo the ground wire, and put it back.  The connector had snapped off, so it's not a matter of just screw it back in either. 

So my boss ordered me to just ""hold the connector to the ground stud until he got the bus started"". 

Okay, fine. 

It's getting dark, next to a highway where big rigs drive by at speed limit and wind whipping me every few seconds. 

He got the bus started. I got out, slapped my dust off, got into my car, and followed him off the freeway. 

But he didn't stop. He went through the underpass, got back on the highway, and started heading back home. 

I called him and asked him what's going on, he said he's going to drive it home. I reminded him the transmission was acting funny. He said as long as it moves it'll be fine. 

Keep in mind we're about 2.5 hours from homebase (120-150 miles)  

As predicted, after about 25-30 miles the transmission conked out. And the only way to fix this was to turn the power off, thus resetting the transmission computer. Which means I have to climb under the bus and do the restart procedure again. 

And again. 

And again. 

(and so on)

And it's getting worse, enough that my boss is forced to take LOCAL roads instead of the highway, as these highways are not that wide. 

What should have taken 2.5 hours took 5 hours instead. And my car was a total mess because I had climbed in and out and rolled on the ground so many times both I and my car were filthy. 

Turns out the bus need to be towed ANYWAY because our mechanic said it had to be done at his shop... which was an hour away... back the way we came from. 

We could have saved a TON of time and I would have been a lot cleaner if my boss weren't such a cheapskate.",2020-10-27 18:09:06

This happened yesterday, and I'll preface the story by adding how it SHOULD have gone if my boss wasn't so damn neurotic:

&#x200B;

**Me**: Hey boss, just wanted to make you aware that these materials for the light fixture *(holds up tiny bag of screws with picture of said fixture taped to the front w/ a note added)* is only for mounting -- not assembly. President of the dept doesn't need these fixtures mounted, he only wants to look at the fixtures, so I'm leaving these on the table here in the office.

&#x200B;

Simple, right? Right?

No you dum dums -- how naive of you. Here is how it went:

&#x200B;

**Me**: Hey boss, just wanted to make you aware that these materials for the light fixture-

**Boss**: That needs to go in the box. Where is the box? Is it with President?

**Me**: Some of boxes are but -

**Boss**: You need to take that to President! It needs to go in the box and stay together! Where is the fixture?

**Me**: It's with President, sorry i meant to clarify the box is here and I can put it-

**Boss**: So the box is here?! Why isn't it with President? Didn't you say it was over there with him?!

**Me**: No, SOME of the boxes are-

**Boss**: So is that material for the fixture? You need to take that to President, doesn't he need it?

**Me**: No, these materials are only for mounting, and he doesn't want or need to see them mounted.

**Boss**: \*Sighs, exasperated\* All of it needs to stay to together. All of it needs to go in the box. Where is the box?

**Me**: The box is here-

**Boss**: \*giggles condescendingly\* So first you say the box is there, and now it's here. Where is the box for this fixture?

**Me**\*super anxious and confused at this point\*: Sorry, my mind is all over the place. Other Assistant and I took 5 fixtures to President - of those 5, only 3 of them were IN their boxes bc they were fragile. 2 of the boxes, including the one for this fixture, is here in the office.

&#x200B;

*\*Note: Boss was completely aware of what I took to President, and which of the fixtures were boxed before i delivered them.\**

&#x200B;

**Boss**: And doesn't President need those materials? Doesn't he need to mount the fixtures? He needs those materials, boobookenny.

**Me**: No, President doesn't need to see them mounted, only assembled.

**Boss**: And aren't those part of the assembly?!

**Me**: ...no, they're only for mounting. I even confirmed with him and Other Assistant that he doesn't need these.

**Boss**: \*Sighs\* so what do you need from me?

**Me**: I was only trying to make you aware that I'm leaving these here, so that if you saw this bag of materials in the box you didn't panic.

**Boss**: Oh, i thought you were saying that President needed these materials, was looking for them, and had asked you to ask me about them. That's fine. Put it with the box.

&#x200B;

This is what i deal with on a regular basis. I have, on average, about 3-5 panic attacks a week.

Idiot 2: A little while latter, I can't get into my training.  Supervisor goes over. The email says use the link to take the training 2 weeks from now.


Idiot 3: I want to work from home! I bought a Laptop! Supervisor says great, do you have wireless internet? Idiot says, I don't know.  Did the store sell you a router? I bought this box, I think they said something like that. Supervisor basically says good luck with that..",2020-10-20 23:56:15

One we had pegged as a 'maybe', but she called (despite a no calls please in the ad) and basically convinced my partner to interview her. Partner has a big heart and set up an interview for 1pm (time chosen by candidate).  Going by her resume, this woman is late 30s / early 40s.   1:10 goes by and she's a no show, so I send out our usual rejection letter and get the following reply.  


> Dear YYY -

> I am sorry we didn't get the chance to meet about the XXXX job.  I was interested in the position.  I still am.  If you would like to meet another time, please let me know.  I was on the bus and I suddenly remembered that I was late for the interview, this was at 1:41 p.m.  The thing is, I am not interested in a full time position.  I couldn't work on Wednesday or Thursday, because of my other job.  If this doesn't meet your requirements, I understand.  The hours that were discussed (10:30 to 6:30) sound perfect for me, as I am not a morning person.  Also, I am not too far away, making it very convenient. 

> Good luck finding someone to join your team.


The response pretty much scared me - the list of red flags just seems to go on and on.  I'm really surprised just how out of touch this person is.

* can't be bothered to remember an interview

* doesn't want full time despite job being full time

* doesn't want to work mornings 

* not sure if the 'good luck' is a threat or not

Tales of My Awful Boss,6,jdac48,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jdac48/tales_of_my_awful_boss/,6,1602997227.0,"So for context, I am an 18 Y/O girl who has been working for four years now. I have worked for multiple companies and am currently working for one of the craziest boss' I ever have. She owns a for-profit thrift store and has for the past 9 years. So far I have worked for about 6 months for her. These are the tales of how nuts she is.

Recently her a-hole bf came to the store to pick up his 6-year-old daughter. Every night after close she has us come sit out back with her and smoke, watch her drink, and partake in the lettuce of devils. Although I wouldn't mind she gets fairly drunk and often says some pretty rude and downright mean things. So anyway, her bf comes and gets her daughter (we'll call the daughter L for short and Boss M) as usual. He seemed pretty angry as he stomped around the store and yelled at L to hurry up or he was leaving without her. A few minutes later after he had left I watched him get everything and get in his truck before locking the door because he had made me feel uneasy about the situation and I didn't want him coming back in.  Well not soon after he had left I'm towards the back entrance where my co-worker and M are having ""miller hour"" when I hear him begin to yell at her. I see my co-worker rush to the front and grab the work phone and pocket it. It is important to note here that she had cheated on him in the past at the store with a random guy. She has a theory that bf is hacked into the cameras and is watching her. This cheating business happened well before I had started working there. Apparently, she had been messaging the other guy on the work phone and her bf was now screaming at her to give him the phone to look through while additionally calling her an alcoholic. I can hear L yelling at him saying ""Don't hurt Mommy Daddy! Stop!"" and suddenly hear a noise that sounded like he had just punched her. My co-worker comes back out with 911 dialed but not connected and asks him if the police needed to be called. The bf walks back to the truck and goes home. We all sat out back talking about it and she clarifies that he had thrown her beer on her and stomped on the can, this being the noise I heard not him hitting her. After a bit of chatting I leave and go home.

Later that week she comes to the store and tells me that he had kicked her out (bf pays rent on the house, and her names not on it) and that she doesn't know where she's going to go. Later that night bf comes and picked L up like normal and I watch out the window since M was talking with him and I didn't want things to escalate. She is smiling and laughing with him! She comes back in and informs me that she won't be here Friday because she and bf are going fishing over the weekend... I ask why if he just kicked her out and she says that she doesn't want him going all by himself. I say whatever and leave it as this is not my problem. 

This is only one example of her craziness. Now let me tell you all about her calling me fat and making fat jokes until I am almost in tears. 

When I first started she would make offhand comments about how short people gain weight really easy and that I needed to be careful or I would ""pudge out"". I am 4'11 and weigh 110lb. I am in no way fat. She then goes on throughout the weeks telling me I shouldn't eat more of whatever we're having and that I don't want to get fat, do I? One day I am on the phone with my mom who is asking what I want from a local taco store. M is listening in, asking me who it is and why she's calling. I tell her she's asking me about dinner. I then tell my mom I want two tacos and a quesadilla. M snorts when I say I want to tacos and says ""Maybe you should only get one.... two seems a bit much doesn't it?"" I tell her that no, two is not too much and I will be just fine. After three weeks of this, I tell her to stop making comments on my weight and she apologizes and stops. 

This does not, however, keep her from going on a twenty-minute rant a few weeks later about how my Dad is going to kill himself from overdosing and how selfish and awful he is. My Dad is an addict and in no way is a bad guy or malicious, just can't quit his addictions that he had had for about 30 years now.  M's Dad had passed from overdosing and apparently, this now makes all addicts terrible. She tells me how one day I'm going to get a call that he's dead and that I am going to feel awful and like it's all my fault and that I could have done something to prevent. She tells me how selfish and terrible my Dad is for doing this to me. I look visibly uncomfortable as does my co-worker and try and tell her that it's not like that at all but this doesn't stop her. Instead, she tells me that she knows because she's also a parent and would never do something like this to her child. Once she finally stops I get up to finish my chores and leave. She comes inside and sees I look sad. She has the audacity to ask me what's wrong and makes me hug her. My co-worker pipes up and tells M I have a headache and probably just want to go home. I agree and leave for the day. She never apologized for saying that and tells me all the time how worthless my Dad is.

So after working for her and getting treated this terribly I decide to get a second job and move to just working Monday and Friday and well as getting my mom to pick up my other shifts. M is not happy about this but agrees as well as boosting me to $12/hr on the condition that I ""don't fuck her over"", whatever that means. Yesterday I was waiting for her to come inside and give me my paycheck. I wasn't complaining and I at some point had caught her eye through the window and smiled and waved because she was just looking at me. Finally, she comes inside and stomps over to the coat rack and angrily says ""No one will be getting paid on Friday if these coats aren't all zipped and the fucking linen rack isn't done. This looks like fucking shit."" I turn to her beyond angry at this point and calmly say ""Well M, I was not being impatient. I was just talking with co-worker while I waited. I will zip up the coats and do the linen rack before I leave tonight."" This catches her off guard and she says ""Well why did you tell me she was waiting for her check? You made me look like a bitch!"" M tells my co-worker. co-worker says ""Because you asked me why she was still here, I didn't she say she was being impatient."" M huffs and starts my check, complaining the whole time how hard it is to pull up the payroll and what not. I take about twenty minutes, off the clock mind you, to fix all the coats and linens. I was never told we needed to zip up coats and my mom had been working as well. I thought she had done linens and co-worker had told me I was fine to go and he'd make sure I didn't miss anything! While I'm doing the clothes she thanks me for doing it and when I don't answer she says it in an annoyed tone, clearly expecting me to say you're welcome. So I do growing even more pissed at this point. I finally come to get my check and she forces me to give her a hug and say good-bye to her. I reluctantly do so just wanting to go home. 

I have now determined that the next slightly disrespectful thing she says to me I am going to tell her off and quit on the spot. My other job is begging me to come work full time and have far better treatment, benefits, and pay than she has. Thank you all for reading and if there are any grammar mistakes I'm sorry, I'm not the best at grammar and failed it despite my best efforts in school. If any of you have any suggestions on what I should exactly say to her come the time I say fuck it comment to tell me!

TL:DR 
Boss has bullied me about my weight, told me my Dad is going to kill himself my overdosing in a twenty minute rant about it, makes me hug her, and makes me work off the clock and threatens to take my pay away if I do anything wrong like not zipping up the coats. She also told me yesterday that she had spat lougies on the company next doors car because they parked in front of out store. Dont worry, I put my two weeks in yesterday!",2020-10-18 08:00:27
AITA for quitting my job after only about 2 months?,108,jda0yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jda0yi/aita_for_quitting_my_job_after_only_about_2_months/,29,1602995751.0,"Couldn't post this to AITA because of character limit so im posting here

 Ok, so in the middle of October 2019, I got a job interview at one of my local pizza chains. Right off the bat, I could tell that the boss, we'll call her H, was overworked and very understaffed. The interview went well, and since I had already interviewed there once before, I got the job right then. We even went so far as to schedule my first few days of training right there at the interview. I was very happy to have gotten a job, and my training days went by quickly after that. H made a few remarks about how the training and the first rush hour usually scare people off and that she was glad to have somebody be excited for the job for once. 

I liked the job, even though some of the coworkers were not so pleasant, but about a week in, I realized that something was wrong. I wasnt on the written schedule yet, but I was sent an email telling me when I was scheduled. I had set up alarms for when I had to go in, but on a day that I wasn't supposed to be in until 3:00pm, I recieved a text from H at 11:00am, asking me if I knew that I was supposed to be in at 9:00am. I thought that I had obviously made a big mistake and I went in as fast as I possibly could. When I got there, of course I got yelled at for ten minutes by someone who wasnt even my boss, telling me that they had had a lot of customers and were struggling to keep up and that this type of behavior was absolutely not permitted. I tried to explain the mistake and was met with a ""Well that's your problem. I dont want to hear excuses. Just get to work."" After which I proceeded to cry and from there, I began to develop a hate for my job. 

Well, apparantly, as I came to realize, I hadn't made a mistake on what time I was supposed to be in, but rather, it seemed like they were changing my schedule on me without my knowledge. It happened at least every three days, and I knew for a FACT that I was not making that many (if any) mistakes on when I was scheduled for work. I cared about my job and I cared about being a good employee and coworker who could be depended on. I texted and emailed H to ask her about this, and she said that to her knowledge, nobody was changing my schedule, but that part of a job there is that my hours are subject to change, which sounded right, but I think that would at least warrant for them to tell me beforehand. She also told me that if i wanted to stay on top of my changing hours, I needed to be into the store EVERY DAY to check if my schedule had changed. Now, keep in mind that this was my first job, and I thought, hey maybe this is just how it works, but now I've come to learn that its definitely not, unless you're working an on-call type of job. My job was a full time job with few enough hours that it was more like a part time job. If my hours were being changed, she should have at least told me, as she DID have a way to contact me, both through email, AND through text and call. 

So, the stress was mounting, and I hated going in to work, not wanting to be yelled at or humiliated. H herself was great to work for, and she told me several times that I was one of the most skilled pizza builders that she had had in a long time (meaning I made pizzas quickly and that she liked that I actually cared about what they looked like) but my other coworkers, excluding one or two, were not very nice to me. They would take frequent smoke breaks during rush hour, leaving me to work the make table, oven, cut table, and packaging deliveries all by myself for five to ten minutes at a time, then scolding me if (more like when) I was backed up when they came back in. I also had a coworker who would take the orders, who we'll call M, that would come back to the kitchen frequently. If I was building pizzas, she would yell at me that there were things coming out of the oven that needed to be cut, and if I was on the cut table, she would yell at me that the orders were piling up and that i needed to step up my game. I recognized her from my school, and she was younger than me, but still bossed me around. She would always have this look of disdain on her face when she saw me, and, although she had ALSO been trained to help at cut table when it was needed, she would stand there, leaning against the delivery table playing games on her phone and texting friends in between barking orders at me.

Everybody pretty much let me know that I was terrible at the cut table and packing deliveries. 

Make table was great when I had help, as it went by quickly and I could do what i actually liked about the job. I made a friend who was maybe my moms age who was also very new to the job who we'll call Harley. I had been on about a week longer than she had, and so I taught her a lot of the stretching and topping and ratios and whatnot because nobody else would teach her. She said that she appreciated that I taught her in a way that she could understand and that I wasnt harsh. We had the same struggles and the same people that hated us just because we were new. We were both the ones who had our hours changing all the time without us knowing, and we were also the ones that everyone piled the extra work onto. It was good to have at least one person who I looked forward to seeing every shift. 

Even though it was stressful, I hung in there, but things got INFINITELY more stressful when Dixie started coming in. Dixie was the Region Coach (Regional Manager, but we called her the RC), and managed the store in both of the other towns that had ***** ***s near us. When Dixie came in, we all knew that we were going to have an awful day, not because she wasnt nice enough, but because we had all been trained to do things a certain way, and she had us do things completely differently when she was there. She had us stretch dough differently, make garlic knots differently, season crusts differently, make a different pattern of pepperoni, less sauce, less cheese, do dishes differently, no breaks (well I guess I wasnt ever allowed to take a break anyways) throw away any pizzas that we had accidentally messed up (H would let us take them home if we wanted), she would take over our stations for us if she didnt feel that we were operating according to HER rules, the list went on. 

Eventually, she came in almost every day, and H had no say over anything anymore. Work was terrible. 

Back to the issue of people changing my hours. Eventually, Dixie called me and asked me why I hadnt been coming in when I was scheduled. I was on the written schedule by this time, and every time a new schedule was put up, i would stand in front of it and make sure I got EVERY one of my scheduled shifts put into alarms and onto my phone's calendar. I told her ""I'm sorry, but half of the time I don't know WHEN to come in. I think that people are changing my schedule, because I have every one of my shifts written down, but I still keep getting called and scolded for missing shifts that I do not have."" She then went on to tell me that, one, no, nobody was changing my schedule (which i knew had to be some sort of lie, as my aforementioned friend, Harley's, schedule was being changed too) and two, if I was late or didn't show up again, it would be a second strike against me (the first which I didn't even know I had, go figure). It only occurs to me as I'm writing this that maybe (very big maybe, because it still seems pretty far fetched, as everyone knew our names) everyone was confusing me and Harley for a lady who NEVER came in. 

The scheduling issue was the straw that broke the camel's back.

After that call with Dixie, I never went in to work again. I tried to give some sort of notice to H (even if it wasn't two weeks notice), but she never picked up, answered her email, or was able to recieve my texts. I texted Dixie again to ask her to deliver the message to H that i wasnt coming back in, or to at least give me her current contact info so I could tell her myself, but every time, Dixie would refuse, telling me to ""figure it out myself"" and that ""it wasnt her job to pass on resignation notice or H's contact info"". So to this day, H never got my message, and I never got to say goodbye to Harley. Dixie was even the one who took over giving me my final payroll, but at least I was finished. 

TLDR? I got a horrible job at a pizza place where my hours were changed randomly without me knowing, I was treated awful, got work dumped on me, and was walked on a lot.",2020-10-18 07:35:51
Tales from the arcades,19,jcvylt,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jcvylt/tales_from_the_arcades/,3,1602944544.0,"* if the format is fucked that's because I'm on mobile.

Most of the time I was there, things I did were just pretending to be busy, and running around finding a senior tech that can handle the problem that I can't solve. But SOMETIMES there's tales absolutely worthy of being shared, so I've decided to post some here.

Here's a hot one, I'm not the one who experienced it but i was an eyewitness.

An... elderly woman (Karen) and her grandson walked in, made a purchase, Register clerk (RC for short) gave Karen a card and TOLD HER EXACTLY how you can play on most of the cabinets with the card and no physical credits.

Karen and the kid went straight to the Initial D cabinets. *They are the racing simulation cabinets, it has this name because it's based on the anime of the same name.*
But after 5 minutes, she returned to complain that ""MY GRANDSON PUSHED THE BUTTON AND NOW THE CREDITS ARE ALL GONE"" with a voice so loud that she can be heard clear as crystal even when you're 20 feet away from the front desk. *This is because the kid managed to somehow let the machine register more rounds than one because the system is a bit slow, some credits gets lost if you click it faster than it can register. It's a system than can work absolutely fine if you're patient with it.*

RC replied, ""MA'AM, I SHOWED you EXACTLY how to play using the card system, I was extra careful about this because I see you have a kid with you."" But Karen wasn't having any of it, oh hell no, how can this be her fault that the machine is wrong? Now she's ""DEMANDING TO SEE THE MANAGER I'M GOING TO COMPLAINT""

But unfortunately for her, the manager was nowhere to be found ( he might have been taking a little break then as I'm not even sure where he went)

RC told Karen that, if she were to see the manager she had to wait as he was not available. The cycle continued for a minute, but at last Karen decided that it's meaningless and withdrawing the credits out to play is better. RC called Karen back to give her some credits as there's no other way to get the lost credits back.",2020-10-17 17:22:24
"Two guys argue in an intersection, the car was damaged, but it was the bus' fault!",3,jc20zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jc20zx/two_guys_argue_in_an_intersection_the_car_was/,2,1602817508.0,"Welcome to another episode of ""tales from the driver"" (I'm surprised we don't have a subreddit for that?!)  where we tell tales of wow from the perspective of a transportation worker (usually driver, but conductors and others are welcome)

In today's episode: two guys argue, one car broken, but it was the bus' fault!

This tale was relayed by a different bus company owner, let's call him Z, also an acquaintance of mine. We met on the street and we were just shooting the (bleep) when he said he was on the way to see a lawyer about another collision. He claimed it went down like this. 

Z was driving through downtown of a major metropolis. All the streets were one-way downtown, and this street had four lanes. Which lanes were not important. He's at one lane, then to his right, came one of those old-style Cadillac convertibles, you know, long as a boat. Traffic light is red. 

The pedestrian signal already counted down to 10 when an old-timer started to cross. Bus driver, Z, shrugged. This city is ""pedestrian-friendly"", and a lot of poorer people who hang out downtown often do this to annoy the drivers.  They know they cannot cross all the way in the remaining time, but they know the cars have to wait for them to finish crossing. It's just their little power trip. 

The old-timer was using a cane, and he was shuffling slowly.  By the time the light turned green for the Cadillac and the bus, the old-timer had just past the bus and was in front of the Cadillac. 

Z checked left and right, made sure he's clear of the old-timer and started to accelerate. He went barely 15 ft when he felt a crunch on the right side of the bus. He hit the brakes and stopped and turned on the four-way flashers. 

He got off the bus and can't believe what he saw. The Caddilac driver looking completely poleaxed. The Caddilac's driver door is on the ground, torn off by the bus, which suffered heavy gouges to the side from mid-bus all the way back to the wheel arch. And the old-timer was beating on the Caddilac's hood with his cane, yelling ""Serves you right!""

Needless to say, police was called, many squad cars arrived to control traffic, and it was only much later that Z was able to piece together what had happened. 

The old-timer had walked past the bus, still in cross-walk, and was in front of the Caddilac when the light turned green. So the Cadillac guy honked the horn at the old-timer. 

The old-timer retaliated by whacking his cane on Cadillac's hood (bonnet to you Europeans) 

The Cadillac driver wasn't having that. He opened the driver's side door... 

Right into the moving bus... 

Which tore his door off. 

And now the Cadillac's owner is suing Z's company because they consider the accident Z's fault, as he should not have moved the vehicle because old-timer was still in the cross-walk. Then it's just matter of a ding or a dent, not severe body damage to two vehicles. 

I told Z that the reasoning is ridiculous, and I hope he wins. 

Actually, I don't think I've ever heard back from Z whether he won or not.

Bus company put out of business because one old lady did not know which bus company to sue,12,jbzcje,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/jbzcje/bus_company_put_out_of_business_because_one_old/,6,1602806769.0,"This is more of a rant. This involved a friend's company. 

To set the background: Bus company have to answer all sorts of odd claims of injury, I've seen people who claimed injury from the bus company even though they were already OFF the bus and walking away. Or all sorts of strange claims that were somehow, always the bus' fault. This is one of them.  

A bus company (which we will call ""BusCo"") is owned by E.  One day, he got this registered mail. He opened it. It was notification of a lawsuit against BusCo. The really curious thing: everything is typed except the company name, which was hand-written. Did not recognize the name or the lawfirm. So he dutifully called up his insurance and started a claim process, except he doesn't know anything. No date, no bus number, no driver.  

His insurance assigned a lawyer, and they went over the paperwork, called up the other side, and finally got some details. A certain old lady X claimed she was injured onboard a certain casino bus that runs between the major city and the casino in the evening and comes back early next morning. She made it off the bus, but casino ended up calling her an ambulance.  

There is only one problem: BusCo has NO BUS going to that specific casino that evening. This is easily proven by Busco's dispatch log and casino's arrival log. 

But you can't really prove a ""negative""...  As the X's lawyers refused to accept that they sued the wrong company. X herself is of no use. When questioned, she actually CANNOT identify the bus company at all, or even the specific bus.  She does remember the driver was called J, but no full name.  And you guessed, it, there was no such driver employed at BusCo by that name, even by nickname. 

E (the owner of BusCo) was actually good friends with casino security, and security told him, unofficially, that X's lawyers sent someone to the casino one night, and basically wrote down the info of the first company that arrived from the city. And it just happens to be Busco. Security knew this because the ""investigator"" first tried to ask the security guards about at what time would the buses from the city arrive. 

CLARIFICATION: In this business, many runs are made through sub-chartering, i.e. company A got a job to do Y, but but company A can hire company B's bus to actually do it, as long as it's not prohibited in the contract. And sub-chartering obviously does not happen on a schedule, esp. if it was an emergency substitution or an extra run due to heavy demand. 

E was furious, but he's stuck. And due to this ""outstanding claim"", BusCo's insurance renewal is now in jeopardy.  X's lawyers are asking something in the SEVEN figures, something about extensive knee damage, rehabilitation, blah blah blah. And since this ""risk"" was unresolved, his rates went WAY UP despite having had no claims before this incident. 

All in all, it took almost EIGHTEEN MONTHS for E's lawyer to get a summary judgement declaring BusCo has nothing to do with the case, by getting the security video of the bus that X supposedly disembarked from, and proving it is of a completely different model of bus that BusCo does not even own.  Something about round headlights vs. rectangular headlights. 

However, by this time, E had already dissolved BusCo. He could not operate the business with the insurance rate jacked up by this claim and their lawyer unwilling to see reason despite their weak case. And without insurance, he cannot run the business. He sold the bus and went into restaurant business instead.

P.S. By comparing notes, between me, my boss, and E, we actually figured out who J was and whose bus it was. Unfortunately, by this time, that bus was pulled service and junked. And that grainy security video is not conclusive proof. No idea if X and her lawfirm actually got any money out of any one. Doubt it, based on their lousy investigation skills.

P.P.S. Bus companies in this jurisdiction are required to maintain a FIVE MILLION USD insurance policy to operate. This seems to make them a target for spurious lawsuits.

Troubling Tales from the job,43,j9l75y,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/j9l75y/troubling_tales_from_the_job/,8,1602481139.0,"I used to work really shitty hours.   Day started at noon or 3pm 50% of the job was driving somewhere.  For context I live in Indiana: Fairly normie creepy things around here haunted house this abandoned mall that gang shit yucky amount of racists ect.  I would drive 4  to 8 hours to malls in the immediate states (Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, sometimes further like all the way to Florida or North Dakota)  I have one story that is local.  It's a big project so we have a team of six of us.  The project is at Lighthouse Premium Outlets it's in northern Indiana right on the coast of Lake Michigan.  We roll up at 7pm sundown is in thirty minutes .  It's getting pretty cold because the wind off the lake.  It's early March and the trees are still pretty bare giving you an excellent view of the energy plant that's set right next to the outlets.  The plant has a cooling tower that looms over the entirety of the mall.

[It looked exactly like this when we first rolled up](https://preview.redd.it/1t8co2dvnls51.jpg?width=537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30f6245e0370b847d491d48ad896765eea5dfecb)

&#x200B;

So we get everything setup around 10ish  first thing we notice is this place is DEAD like everyone cleared out Immediately when the sun went down.  About midnight we're halfway done with the job 4 of our guys are already shitty, tired want to go home and I agree but I'm one of the leads so I have to keep moving one cause its cold as hell and two cause we don't leave till the jobs done.  Three guys leave to go get food leaving Mike, Manno and me.  It starts pissing down rain about 15 minutes after they leave.  So we find shelter under that awning that you can see in the picture.  Manno starts talking to Mike saying they need to go finish another job and they want to wait for the other guys to get back.  About an hour later the boys are still not back and the rain has let up so Manno takes Mike they pack up tools and go back to one of the 3 box trucks we drove up and they leave for Detroit.  I am now alone.  I will now be alone for about an hour and a half.  This hour and a half is one of the three reasons I don't work that job anymore.

I'm prepping as much as I can so we can do some heavy lifting when the boys get back.  I don't want to be crushed by 500 pounds of aluminum and fiberglass while alone; Which it turns out I am no longer.  I'm predrilling holes in material, I finish, I stand up, turn around and freeze because there is a large man sitting on a planter just watching me.  as soon as he sees me notice him and lock up he speaks up.

&#x200B;

""Oh, hey man.  You working?""

me:  ""uh.  Hey ya how's it goin?""

""is cold...""

""Ya True brother.  True.""  I notice his jacket and immediately relax.  He's security.

""Hey man you got a cigarette?""

""Oh no sorry man only a juul.""

""That's fine can I hit it?""

""Oh um sorry it's in the truck my guys took to go get food sorry.""  (me thinking what the fucking hell is this?????)

As soon as I say that he gets up and starts quickly walking away before he leaves he mumbles

&#x200B;

""Fuckin cold man..""

&#x200B;

It's been drizzling this whole time: I'm walking to the truck to get some drill bits its a bit of a walk I'm dead tired so I'm dragging my feet my headphones in and head down as I'm coming up to the parking lot I think I hear something under the music I'm listening to.  So I pop a headphone out and  I'm right it's the sound of metal clinking and dragging on the sidewalk behind me.  So I peel of to the side of the sidewalk to let what ever it is behind me pass and I glance over my should and it's a dog.  Head down swaying keeping pace with me about 9 feet back.  Not a huge dog medium sized its collar had a bit of chain attached to the end and it was walking in a way where it was dragging across the ground.  My heart drops.  I love dogs.  and I recognize this dog isn't ok.  I don't know what to do I just stop.  Full lock down I'm hard panicking any tiredness has left me.  it's caught up to me by now as it walks past me it sways deep towards me but it's pace never falters.  It just kept going.  I cut across the parking lot as quick as I can and caught my breath in the cab of the truck.  I never saw it again all night.  While chilling in the truck trying to reason with myself the boys finally come back.  I get out ask them what the fuck took so long apparently they ran out of gas and all the fast food around had closed.  I'm pretty grumpy so I get them started working and help here and there but I'm on pins I'm not feeling well and I just want to go home so once the job is done I'm ready to leave. one truck already left.  I forgot my gloves on the site so I run back to get them real quick the security guard is back.

""You guys all done""

""uh hey ya we're leaving.""

""Hey you guys bring a dog?""

""...No.""

""Huh, alright.  well he's mean as fuck so be careful.  Hey can you come back to the security office to sign off on the work log?""

""Uh hold up let me go get my boss."" ( I am the only boss here at this point)

I start walking back to the truck and Patrick (my coworker) is no longer there.  (this mother fucker left me behind!!) so I walk around as much as I can to see if he pulled around somewhere.  No dice.  So I'm calling him over and over again he finally picks up and says

""Oh,  I thought you went with the other guys?

Waiting in the parking lot standing under the orange yellow sodium lights at the foot of the giant cooling tower shivering  at 4:30 AM.  A low wail picks up from apparently no where.  growing louder.  Then quitter.  It's a Klaxon coming from the power plant like a tornado siren/ air raid siren.  in the cold morning mist had rolled in and the area was straight out of silent hill and with the way the evening had gone I'm shivering from pure dread I'm not cold anymore I just hate being outside.  Patrick Finally pulls back up and we get out of there 3 hours back down to the office.  I didn't sleep the whole time and I pass out every time on the trip back.  My mind was racing nothing super natural happened but the whole night was wrong.  as I was telling Patrick about everything that happened he said he noticed weird things all night as well.  He also says he remembers seeing a dog when him and the boys first came back. later he says he saw it in the woods that surround the parking lot and power plant just walking around but he said it reeked to high hell which I don't remember .  He said it was corpse like rotten.  This didn't help me fall asleep but it definitely solidified it in my brain as somewhere I never want to go back to.(edited)

Having been all over the Midwest the northern states are fucked.  they are creepy the people in the remote areas are fucking weird and bad shit happens up there.

Thanks for reading stay safe and happy Halloween.",2020-10-12 08:38:59
It’s bad for me,67,j8q5cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/j8q5cd/its_bad_for_me/,8,1602356455.0,"So I just came out as bi to my family and friends. So I decided I want to wear my pride ribbon on my jacket at work. I got it years ago at a pride event at my high school and decided to finally wear it. 

So I’m minding my business, ringing up this guys items and he says 

Man: “you know that’s bad for you right?”

Me: “what is sir?”

Man “that” *points to my jacket*

Now my jacket has several other pins on it, mainly horror ones so I ask 

Me: “horror movies are bad for me?”

Man: “no, that” *touches ribbon*

Which honestly made me feel weird cause it was right on my breast. 

Me: “that’s your opinion sir and I’d appreciate it if you’d keep it to yourself”

Man: “just know your going to hell for that”

Me: “good thing I don’t believe in hell” 

Yeah he wasn’t pleased with me",2020-10-10 22:00:55
Hot for teacher,1,j4skgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/j4skgn/hot_for_teacher/,0,1601783300.0,"Hot for teacher

Back in high school, we had plenty of young attractive male teachers. They were always extremely professional and never did anything questionable towards students. Fast forward 5 years, one of my former high school teachers happens to be having a beer at my work. (Waitress at a local bar during college) Of course, automatically noticed each other and kept making constant eye contact. Eventually once the rest of his party had left, I finally walked over and joked how I bet he didn’t remember me. We chitchatted for the rest of my shift as I walked by grabbing beers for my guests. I hinted a few times that I was going to another local bar to have a drink after I was finished there. Luckily he got my hint that I was hoping he would show up there, which he did. A few drinks later and lots of casual flirting, he decided to leave and I told him I would walk with him outside. Let’s just say by the time we had walked to his truck for him to leave, he already had me pinned up against the front seat. Was the greatest make out session I could imagine. Safe to say, I ended up back at his place letting him teach me a whole new lesson, but this time on my body. 

That night I learned a valuable lesson from that former teacher- how a man who knows what he is doing can fuck the shit out of you if he wanted to. And ladies and gents, he most certainly did that. 

Moral of the story- if you see your very attractive former teacher out in public post high school, go fuck him. It will not only be great sex, but an awesome story one day.",2020-10-04 06:48:20

She also wasn’t wearing a mask (and since my boss doesn’t mandate it :/) i couldn’t say anything. She kept getting in my face or getting close to me and I kept trying to back away.

Showing too much fragility in the kitchen,34,j4jlm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/j4jlm7/showing_too_much_fragility_in_the_kitchen/,5,1601747881.0,"I have been working as a server for about a year in a relatively big club somewhere in Canada. I am not good at confrontations, so I try to just do my job and avoid as many unnecessary social interactions as possible. The way that I wrote this is just sad and full of details… it makes me look weak and miserable, but I really need to sleep, and writing it down might help me clear my mind for the night.

Last night, right after I started my break, I went into the upper-level kitchen which is usually used for banquets and major events when the club is at its full functionality (entry and guest capacity are really limited due to the virus) I passed by the Chef’s office, he was sitting on his pc trying to strike a friendly conversation with me as usual. After answering him, I turned around to check what the employee’s meal was for the night in the oven right in front of his office. There were a bunch of boxes of curry, It didn’t look appetizing to me at all so I closed the oven and started walking out of the kitchen, then the Chef stopped me and asked me what was wrong with the food, to which I just replied that I don’t like curry and would just rather grab something from the downstairs kitchen. The Chef was not happy with my reply, he asked me why would they make food for me in the kitchen, looking back, It might have sounded like I wanted to order an actual dish from the menu for myself when I actually just wanted to grab some fries or bread rolls that we serve for the guests. Without knowing fully what I was about to trigger, I told him that I usually grab something to eat from downstair when there is no food for the employees, this offended him greatly and prompted him to ask me:

“Why do you think you’re better than anyone else that works here”

Implying that I get better treatment than other staff really confused me, I treat everyone there with kindness and respect, and hearing something like that opened an old emotional wound. The yelling kept going for what felt like 15 whole minutes and everything started to blur in my head, he kept asking variations of that question at least 4 more times and threatened me with going to my supervisor to ask her about why would I be getting free food and a better treatment until my eyes started tearing up. I was standing there in front of his office with my eyes locked on his facial expressions, without knowing what to answer to any of his questions and being astounded by the whole interaction, my eyebrows kept arching up as a reaction to my surprise but my mouth was covered by a facemask (thank fucking God for the masks) so he couldn’t see my surprised Pikachu face impersonation and took the eyebrows movement as me challenging him. Since I kept stuttering and that was the only clear feedback he was getting from me, he then started to mimic it and kept questioning what it meant, mocking me and telling me how he is the one paying for all the lost food that I’ve probably stolen every day. My brain stopped processing all those words being thrown at me, I turned around grabbed one of the chicken curry boxes from the oven, looked down, and started sobbing uncontrollably, apologizing profusely for whatever I did to offend him and begged him to just let me go to my break. After he noticed my heavy breathing and the tears going into my facemask he gave me a bs apology and told me that he didn’t mean to upset me, he said at least 2 more sentences that I couldn’t decipher and without another word, I walked away into the breakroom. Thankfully, the room was empty for the first five minutes, so I let out all the frustration in tears, not being able to defend myself for fear of losing my job broke me.

My break was ending and I needed to go back to work, the supervisors saw me standing behind the bar, cleaning my tears with my sleeve and brought me to aside to ask me what was going on, I tried my best to not recreate the whole thing in my head and lied to them, telling them that I received some bad news and one of my grandparents was in critical health so I could be sent home without having to look fragile to them as well.

I was supposed to work another shift today, but I feel like I need at least a week away from there to process what happened without being questioned about it by people that saw me crying and think about my life choices.

This is my first post; I hope it's interesting enough. Thank you for reading.",2020-10-03 20:58:01
Working with the scourge known as Stoner Boi,25,j43x76,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/j43x76/working_with_the_scourge_known_as_stoner_boi/,0,1601675923.0,"Hi there! it's my first time in this thread but I'm here with a tale from a friend whose seen things and  watched bad bosses go down with the ship!

\----

Alright it's Abraxis's friend here again and gonna try a different story here as being out of work and having some free time has gotten me thinking on some of my work experiences. And one I remember very well actually came from a job I left about a year ago now. Namely my experience with by far one of the laziest workers I've ever had the displeasure to work for. (I would later experience a second one similar at another job but that's another story)

Now for privacy reasons I'm going to try keeping details at the minimum. But to sum up where I worked it was bowling alley with a restaurant, bar, gambling hall heck even a kids play area. Was a dated but pretty good place to hang out. Heck I to this day have very fond memories of working there before I had to leave cause I couldn't stand the direction it was going in (Another story). I'm just trying to make it clear at the time I had no issues with the job.

As to my role in this place. I was a humble dishwasher, I'd occasionally do extra work namely cleaning jobs that no one wanted to do or were disturbed to attempt, help move around stock and also helped taste test and give feedback on new food ideas chefs would come up with. We were all and all pretty close staff wise and watched out for our own. I think there was truly only one person up to when I left I truly never got along with. (Excluding owners, but again another story) Point is this was great job for anyone who either had social issues or just starting with entering the working world. And small humble back pat for me, I was considered one of the best dishwashers they had and so I regularly got busy shifts and good hours with tips. Which didn't mind, but hey everyone needs a break and some help.

Enter Stoner Boi (Because the stuff we came up with would make a sailor blush). Now to kinda explain this kid's attitude. He was very much your stereotypical party stoner teen who clearly thought he was the hottest thing for whatever reasons, hint he was not.

Now starting off he did do his job helping me at the dish pit while I and others trained him. He wasn't great but hey figured he was probably around the age I got my first job I'll give him a chance and dish pit can be hard to get used to as it's very fast paced especially on weekends when buffets and specials are out. After maybe about a few weeks he started doing stuff on his own without folk and already I noticed red flags. The big one was that suddenly he wanted time off and would come to me to ask for it off. I figured at first hey I'm a cool guy he's young I need the hours and money sure I'll do this for him. 

Yeah eventually I had to start putting my foot down as once became many more times. He'd start calling in sick and my bosses (We'll call them Chief and the other Game Master, both were the head chefs) would call me in. Now keep in mind this kid wasn't working many shifts at most he'd be working maybe 3 five our shifts at most. Basically covering me so I can have some set days off. Of course stubborn as a mule me took the shifts when he'd no show after he'd fail to convince me or someone to take his shift. Cause hey need money and I'm not doing it for his sorry ass anymore I'll do it for the Chief and Game Master cause those two are awesome. Eventually it got too much and my body started crapping out as I was working sometimes 12 hours straight a day cause I had to cover his shift and mine. I think ended up pulling about 60 hours in one week cause of this.

But yeah my body crapped out and I got sick with a combination of fatigue and a nasty flu. I couldn't eat anything cause it'd just come back up so with my crazy metabolism I lost weight fast and couldn't do anything barring occasional excursions to use the bathroom and cook rice. I of course called in sick cause well I was legit sick. I think it was my third day missing work and Chief calls in asks me to come in and cover Stoner Boi as he's sick too. 

Of course I got pissed and told him dude. I'm literally vomiting so much I'm losing weight. I think at the time he was thinking I was faking or fed up with Stoner Boi as he told me to bring in a doc note. Which I protested against cause I was clearly ill and with a known illness that could be transferred and you want me to go to a clinic when I'm barely functioning to get a doc to write a special paper saying what I'm saying is true. Well I complied any way and in about 2 days later I was back. I still remember everyone's faces and Chief apologizing to me profusely for not believing me. They even started feeding me to try and help me get my weight normal again. And apparently they ripped Stoner Boi a new one. I'd like to say his work improved and he was diligent. But nope I swear a few times he came in coming down from a high or a hangover and I still had to pick up the slack.

As to why he wasn't fired to put it simply it was his first job and bosses went out of their way to give him a chance to improve. Well while his work ethic didn't improve I at least wasn't having to cover his shifts no more and just had a bit of extra work each day. Not that it mattered as I had gotten pretty competent at doing catch up. Plus it helped too I had a family camping trip that I asked for time off coming which I had asked off months in advanced. Well Stoner Boi sees that on the schedule and asks if I switch shifts with him cause he's apparently got some basket ball game. I tell him flat to his face no I had planned this months in advance and covered his sorry rear enough to the point it made me sick. He seemed to begrudgingly accept it. Come camp trip I get a call from both bosses asking me to come in. Apparently Stoner Boi bailed. I told them sorry mates been doing this too long and I'm on vacation I asked for with family. They were cool about it and understood.

Come my return I of course find I have to play massive catch up. Simply cause there was just too much to handle even with our dishwashers beyond me and Stoner Boi. Get caught up only to find out Stoner Boi put in his two weeks notice. Yeah if only despite being scheduled again he bailed. Luckily I only had to work a little extra each day with normal 8 hours and actually have days off. But yeah never saw Stoner Boi again. And that was the tale of the Stoner Boi co worker. I eventually left that job but that's another story. But yeah I hear Stoner Boi is actually a taboo subject for some that still are there. Just goes to show the great effect one horrible co worker can have.",2020-10-03 00:58:43
Tired of being talked to like a dog,54,indgs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/indgs3/tired_of_being_talked_to_like_a_dog/,9,1599356507.0,"I've been working as a caregiver for the past 6 months and now also working 2 other jobs to make ends meet. I really like being a caregiver, I've worked about a year in a memory care centered retirement home and have a first aid cert. Also an LMT but that's another story for another time. 

Usually I love my job but I'm tired of how my current client talks to me. She is not memory care, so no dementia. She is wheelchair bound but very independent in her own life which makes me happy. She asks me to do a million different things in a short time span, half of which i dony feel are really care or cleaning-related. I usually don't mind doung these things but she is hosting a porch sale on a tiny enclosed porch and keeps adding to it. She also wants all these piles of knick knacks to be sorted out and neatly stacked for the sale when there isn't even room for them! It's like she expects me to have super powers of space and time diffusion and is disappointed that I don't!

I don't know why this bothers me so much. I like caregiving, it's grueling, exhausting, and important. I'm not so into this yard sale retail thibg though. I guess im just too old to put up with a cognitively able adult talk to me like a high schooler.

A print shop is a living, breathing beast of a room filled with things that will hurt you the moment you don’t respect them. It’s a well balanced hurricane of noise and bustle with people all moving about doing a thousand things at once. It’s the mental picture I always get when I hear some guy with a mid-atlantic accent made of enlarged adenoids and unfiltered cigarettes in an old-time film talk about “Progress and Industry”.

It’s generally not considered to be the kind of place you get to see Heroes in action. But, life and industry are full of surprises. Sometimes those Heroes come in the form of a person you’d least expect. 

Borz is one of them.

This fuckin guy - in his short-sleeved, button-down dress shirt and giant square ‘80s glasses that defined half his face - was the living, breathing definition of a nerd. Sure, his glasses had gone out of style a decade before, but he didn’t give a shit. Borz didn’t bother with fashion. He rocked a moustache that would make “Diabeetus” Brimley proud; he may have done this to hide the fact that he quite possibly had no upper lip at all. Borz has always been a “Form Follows Function,” no bullshit kind of guy.

Borz owned being a nerd, and was confident, capable, and cool. He gave no visual clues of being anything more than an old-school trades teacher who wasn’t about to take any of your bullshit.

That’s exactly what I thought of him anyways, when I walked into his class as a high-school junior in the early ‘90s.

He was the instructor of the Printing/Graphic Arts class at the Tech Center, and like a hickey on a hemorrhoid, I was to become a bright and shiney pain in his ass. Everything you need to know to truly understand my relationship with Borz can be explained in the fact that during my second year in his class he changed the default error sound on every computer in the entire department to a loud recording of himself saying, “Boden, just leave the thing alone!” 

And to think it all began with a clerical error.

I was originally enrolled in the Media Production class. I’d had some manner of recording studio in my parent’s house since I was twelve, and that was the path I wanted to pursue. So, when I saw there was a class for recording and production, I thought it would be a natural fit. It was, in fact,  the one and only reason I signed up for Tech Center in the first place. But the fickle finger of fate fucked me, and when I showed up for my first day of class I was directed to a totally different room.

Somewhere along the way, a computer had flipped a bit, a secretary had screwed up, or maybe God just decided the Borz needed to be punished. Whatever happened, I was magically assigned to the printing class. I was pissed. What the fuck do I want to learn about printing for? I don’t care about printing. I don’t want to waste years in a bullshit class that I’m never going to use to learn a trade I don’t give a shit about. I went back to the office to bitch, and the poor secretary - who was tits deep in a thousand minor crises on the first day of classes - kindly asked me to just ride out the day and that tomorrow I’d be put back into the right class.

“Yes, Ma’am,” I said, and walked quietly back to class.

It took only two hours of my first day with Borz to change my entire opinion on printing. The secretary kept her word and changed my class assignment the next day, but I never set foot in Media Production. I just kept going to Borz’s class. They couldn’t drag me away.  
See, a print shop is a delight to the senses. There’s nothing even close to compare it to, except maybe working in a chocolate factory. To this day, the smell of a printshop is one of the happiest memory triggers in my world. Everything in there has a distinctive smell, even the different printing processes have their distinct smells, from Offset to Flexo to Screen. It’s incredible, and I loved it from the moment I walked in.

It’s also loud as hell. If you’ve ever worked in a shop with an air compressor you get the idea. Only imagine twenty air compressors of all different sizes running at the same time in a room with thirty people. A printing press makes such a distinctive sound that there’s actually a word for it. It’s the onomatopoetic origin of the word “cliché”. 

Conversations happen at a respectable shout, like in a night-club. The first time you step in the room it’s intimidating as hell. After a week, you’re not only used to it, but it becomes comfortable. Hell I’ve had naps in the process camera darkroom.  
The first thing you walked past as you entered the print shop was the large, old, battleship grey, Steelcase desk sitting just to the left as you step in the front door. This was Borz’s desk, or at least, the desk that was ostensibly his. It was the spot that any teacher would have their desk, but in the three years I spent with Borz I never saw him sit down, much less man a desk. Borz isn’t exactly the kind of guy who does “desk” work.   
The desk was a catch-all for random shit and drawers were often left hanging open. One day I noticed a pair of absolutely gigantic, flat-head screwdrivers sitting in one of the side drawers. Each one was about eighteen inches long and had a shaft about half-an-inch thick. I’d never seen them used for anything, and all the other tools were spread around the shop. These two were clearly special. I pondered their existence for a moment, but quickly went on with my day and forgot about them.

At least, for the next year and a half...

I was cutting business cards on the hydraulic paper cutter - one of my favorite machines to operate. There’s something about a machine that has a four-foot-wide razor blade with a thousand pounds of force behind it that just satisfies the reptile brain and makes my dangly bits tingle. It doesn’t care what you put in there, it’s going to crush it and then slice it. We will not discuss the things that a high-school kid will put in a large hydraulic smashing/slicing machine, but I will admit to being the reason that by the end of my first year there, the blade was about as sharp as the head of my dick and required not just sharpening but outright replacement.

It’s quite simple to operate, you only have two buttons and a foot pedal. Put the paper in the right place on the table, noting the yellow strip of plastic set in the table where the blade will come down. Push the pedal with your foot and the hydraulic clamp comes down to hold the paper in place. Note that you often need to have your hands very close to this, and it doesn’t give a fuck if your hand is in the way when it comes down. Many people have learned what a “degloving” injury is this way.

Assuming you did your job with half a brain and were paying attention, you then put your two healthy and intact hands along the front edge of the machine about 3 feet apart and then push the two big buttons at the same time. Only then will the four-foot-long razor blade come down and shear off anything from a single page up to a couple reams in one smooth slice. 

I’ve done this so many times that I’ve actually done it in my dreams. It’s easy, relaxing… mind- numbing. I’ve spent hours in front of this machine and completed many thousands of cuts.

When you’re standing in front of the cutter, about two feet directly behind you is a medium-sized Gestetner offset press, somewhere in a 200 or 300 series. The gentleman who was running it that day was a gigantic, dopey kid with platinum blonde hair and skin so pale he was teetering on Albinism. He carried the physique of a pudgy gorilla and had an IQ roughly approaching room temperature on his best days. He was about six-and-a-half feet tall and had forearms as thick as my thighs. At that moment, he had a rag in one hand and the jog button under his other.

That was the moment when every person reading this who has ever been a pressman at any point in history, just visibly twitched and gave an understanding wince.

An offset printing press is fundamentally two massive slabs of steel set on edge with as many rollers as some little German man can figure out how to set between them. There are rollers for water, ink, plates, blankets, and they come in every form you can imagine: knurled steel, shiny chrome, hard rubber, and even cloth. Offset printing is all about the rollers.

All of these rollers are set in motion by only a few controls. There’s the typical Go and Stop buttons, the Big Red E-Stop on every press, and there’s a forward and reverse Jog button. “Jog” means to move the machine just a small amount, and it inches everything around just a little bit and at a slow speed for as long as you push the button. It’s a common cleaning practice to jog the machine just a fraction of a turn, wipe everything you can see, jog a little more, wipe some more, over and over again.

What you absolutely fucking do not ever do is move any part of the machine while your hand is near it. Because the rollers are almost all in contact with the roller next to them, and wherever two rollers meet is called a “pinch point”. The space between them is just enough to fit a thin film of ink, water, or a sheet of paper. Because the ends of the rollers are set in bearings pressed into giant slabs of steel, they don’t stretch worth a shit. Running anything though these gaps aside from the ink, water, and paper that they were designed for results in a level of excitement, expensive sounds, and injuries that no pressman ever wishes to experience. Any press will handily remove body parts, and large ones have eaten men whole in what can only be described as a horrific and gruesome way to die.

Modern presses are festooned with guards and even contact rails for the larger pinch points. The contact rails will emergency-stop the machine if you bump into one, and will usually save your life, but not your arm.

None of that, however, was on the mind of the idiot albino gorilla who was cleaning that press at that moment, though. Running a printing press is only about ten percent of your time as a pressman. These presses will blast five thousand sheets of paper through in an hour with ease. The actual printing is done before you know it. In reality, you spend about ten percent of your time running the job, about twenty percent setting the machine up, and about a thousand percent of your time cleaning the damn press. This is not a career where people wear nice clothes.

The high albedo, albino gorilla was on this third color of the day, cleaning the Cyan from his press as I was cutting the sheets of business cards for the school faculty into neat little stacks. This had been going on for the better part of half an hour when I heard a quiet, little voice muddled in the din like a fart in a hurricane.

“Uhhhhhhh… Borz?” the gorilla said, at a level that would have been appropriate for a conversation in an elevator.

He never yelled. He never raised his voice, even once. He didn’t flail or throw things. He was perfectly calm. If he was any more laid back, he’d have been in a coma. What he did do was get even more pale. His face looked like a sheet of 110 Index.

“Uhhhhhhhhh… (the sound of a human brain trying to find second gear)... Borz?” he said, several more times before it registered in my own brain, and I turned around. People shouting, “Hey Borz!” was a common thing in that room, and as he’d said it so quietly, it didn’t really register my attention. Besides, I was focused on my own low-forgiveness task.

And that’s when I turned around behind me and saw the damn fool with his middle finger about an inch farther into the pinch-point between the two ink rollers on top of the machine than anything thicker than a film of ink can fit. That had to hurt enough to make The Pope say motherfucker. 

“Aw, fuck! **BORZ!!**” I shouted at the top of my lungs while taking two steps and punching the nearest Big Red Emergency Button on the wall. There were a couple of these in the room, and they were the emergency shutoff for every circuit feeding the presses. It was the button that turned off the world, and was on top of the list of things you ***do not fuck with***. The roar of the room stopped in an instant; you could have heard a mouse pissing on a cotton ball.

Thirty people all stopped whatever they were doing, yanked into a new reality by the sudden silence, and heads started prairie-dogging above equipment and the cubicle-height dividing wall near the prepress area. I looked up and the first thing I could see was Borz on a dead run from across the room. He lept clear over a waist-high Itek press like it was a thousand-pound hurdle; three long strides later he had slammed open the drawer in his desk. Within ten seconds of my pushing that button he had a giant screwdriver in each hand and was running past me towards the dopey gorilla.

“Are you ok?” he asked, without stopping moving.

“Um, yeah,” said the dipshit, still totally calm.

I stood back, only a couple feet away, with a front row seat as Borz marched up the Gestetner with poise, purpose, and passion. He threw his arms back, let loose a yell and with one smooth motion he brought his arms ferociously down and drove each of those screwdrivers deep into the gap of the offending rollers - missing the gorilla’s finger by only an inch or two on either side. The gorilla nearly pissed himself. Christ, I nearly pissed myself, and I didn’t even have any skin in this game.

And then came the moment of my young life that taught me a precious and permanent lesson about never judging an individual by their outward appearances alone.

Borz gave a loud grunt, set his shoulders into it, and heaved with one arm while pulling with the other. He began applying a staggering amount of force into the screwdrivers, so much so that the hardened shafts began to noticeably bend. Forthwith, his upper shirtsleeves stretched, bulged, and went as tight as a funeral drum. In a matter of seconds, with a growl from him and the creaking and popping sounds of permanent damage promising a lengthy repair bill from the ink system, he hate-fucked that press to a crygasm and levered up a gap between the rollers big enough that I could have fit my hand through it.   
The gap opened up leaving the kids smashed fingertip smeared against one of the rollers for a moment until he quickly pulled back his hand and the fingertip peeled off with it, dangling in space unnaturally, as thin as a piece of cardstock. By now, a crowd had circled to witness the spectacle and the sight of the finger was too much for one of the guys in the back. He narrowly made it into the hall before loudly making the second biohazard from our classroom that day. 

Moments later, the gorilla was in a car being driven to the emergency room of the hospital in town.

We all stood there in shock at what we had just seen - **did nerdy little Borz just fucking** ***DO*** **that**?   
What none of us knew was that the man who we had only known as the nerdy guy with the big glasses and the walrus ‘stache, was actually a championship windsurfer in his summers off and spent his time carving waves from Michigan to Maui. When he wasn’t surfing, he was building race cars and doing things with Mazda’s that God and Wankel never intended. Under that short-sleeved, button down, engineering outfit, was a set of arms with muscles that could snap your bitch ass in half.

Borz was a secret badass hiding the ripped body of a surfer dude with a layer of nerd camouflage; he lived the quiet life of a tradesman and educator in the backwoods of rural Michigan.

The world slowly came back into gear after we all spent a good ten minutes just taking in all that had happened. I went back to cutting my cards and just being quietly in awe of the impressive feat I’d just witnessed, with a fair bit of newfound respect for Borz.

The gorilla came back the next day with a big bandage and splint on his finger, he was fine in the end but his middle finger is a half-inch shorter to this day. For the remainder of his time in High School he was given the new nickname, “Lefty”.

Heroes are quietly lurking everywhere; never underestimate the nerds. Some of them are pretty fuckin’ rockstar.

Thank you Borz, you’re still “BAAAAD!” Even now, twenty-seven years later and a decade after your retirement, you’re still one of my heroes. Thank you for your patience, your persistence, and for never giving up on me, or the countless other dumbass problem kids whose lives you helped shape. I am unendingly thankful for the lessons you instilled in me, not just in knowing my points and my picas, but knowing craftsmanship, dedication, and treating people with decency and respect. You made a hell of a difference in a thousand lives, and I’m proud to be just one example.

Thank you for being the greatest kind of hero, a Teacher.

The energy of our waiting room was off,102,hscel7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/hscel7/the_energy_of_our_waiting_room_was_off/,7,1594915915.0,"I wanted to share this as I just found the whole thing quite funny and bizarre, 

I work in a small clinic and we share the building with another practise, they let us seat our patients in their waiting room. 

One day I hear the door bell go so press the buzzer to let them in. After about a half a minute I don’t see anyone appear so I go open the door myself to see a patient standing there looking down his nose at me and frowning. The main door has a big plaque that says ‘when you hear the buzz  please push the door’ so I make a light hearted ‘oh the door can get stuck sometimes’ and he says no I read the sign however it’s incorrect it sounds more like a drone than a buzz so you should get that changed. I was a bit taken aback but said sure we’ll look into it for you (it couldn’t sound any less like a drone btw). 

I tell him to take a seat in the waiting room and someone will be with him shortly. A few minutes later he pops his head into my office and tells me to come to the waiting room immediately, once we get there I’m like is everything alright sir, are you wanting a tea or a coffee? And he turns round as says your waiting room is all wrong, the energy is totally off you need to move everything around now. I am now trying to work out if he is having a laugh or if he is genuinely  upset with the layout (it’s a lovely waiting room- big tall chairs and a chesterfield sofa, big tv, wall of fridges etc). I said I’m not sure what you want me to do as it’s not really our waiting room, we are just allowed to use it. He then said right that’s it I’ll have to do it myself, started trying to move the furniture and asking the patients already sat down to move. 

I basically had to go get one of the managers of the other practise to calm him down and stop him moving things around, they seated him in a separate room to avoid further upsetting the other clients. Before he left that day he handed me a very detailed plan he drew of what the waiting room SHOULD look like, I pinned it up on the wall so I can reminisce.",2020-07-16 19:11:55
I see another two! (long),36,hnw48x,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/hnw48x/i_see_another_two_long/,2,1594266562.0,"# I posted this 4 years ago in /r/pettyrevenge, I like it because it is 100% true, word for word. Here it is:

So, I'm back at my photo studio and I get a phone call from Donna, an Art Director at a regular corporate client of mine.

Can she bring over a couple of new Suits for executive portraits?

Sure, I'll get set up.

She shows up a few minutes later and says that the Suits will follow shortly.

The Suits show up and they look cool, one is in his mid-fifties; has the requisite great salt and pepper hair, although his complexion is a little ruddy, nose a little bulbous, indicating that he likes to drinks a bit.

The other one, who I'll call ""The Playa"" appears younger at first but I detect some tell tale wrinkles on his face, indicating most likely that he dyes his hair. He's not wearing a tie and his shirt is open one button too low to show off his gold chain that matches his bracelet.

\------ The Shoot:

Once I have the lighting for a portrait set up, it takes less than a minute to get a good shot. The key is to communicate with the subject, make the shooting event very real and happening right now. I can use a prepared patter or I can work spontaneously but the key is to have an open heart and take our impressions up to a higher level.

Meanwhile, I have worked with Donna before. We have developed a system where, while I'm shooting and my images are going directly to the computer, she'll edit them and mutter comments and directions to me, like, ""Good"", ""more smile"", or ""chin up"". This is while I'm chatting with the subject, but I can hear her muttering, and truthfully I probably concentrate more on what she's saying than on what I'm saying...

So, I start in with my repartee, ""This will be easy"", I tell the Suits, ""I've already received a couple of requests from the ladies at your company for copies of these photos.""

And they freeze. ""Which ladies?"", the Playa asks.

""No ladies,"" I backtrack, ""I was just joking, haha""

And we move on. I walk the first Suit onto the set and I ask him where he's from. ""California"", cool. I start shooting and talking, a flash about every two seconds.

I ask him if he's been to the Happy Hour at the local Sports Bar, he says no. ""You gotta go"", I tell him, ""everybody is there, and if you get enough shots into Teresa, she'll get to dancing on the tables"" haha

I go on and on, along the same lines, I switch to the Playa and start with him, Donna is muttering in the background, I really don't remember all the things I said, undoubtedly all about how lovely the women at their company are and how liquor flows freely in this part of town.

We finish up, it took less than two minutes, and the Suits and I walk over to the computer to edit the shots with Donna. She starts flipping through them and the first Suit says, ""Well, I'm sure you'll pick something good"", and turns on his heel and walks out the door. The Playa splits right behind him.

I follow them out, to lock the outside door and not a word more was spoke between us.

I go back into the studio and Donna is there with her head on the desk. ""Are you OK?"", I ask her.

She picks her head up, throwing her hair back and stares for me for a moment drinking me in......""Do you know who those guys were?"".

""Not at all""

""You haven't heard from anyone in the company about them?""

""No, I swear"" I'm starting to sweat.

She seems to be deciding whether she should confide in me, she says, ""When I first heard you talking I thought you were just spewing men's bullshit, the way men talk to each other, but as you went on and on, digging a deeper and deeper hole, I realized that you had no idea what you were saying. You must be some kind of idiot.""

Am I?

Here's the story: ""We bought these guy's company. The two jokers came with the package. In the first three months ""Playa"" has been hit with three sexual harassment complaints. He's not even allowed in the art department without an escort. And who's the person who fields these complaints? THERESA IN HUMAN RESOURCES, the one you said dances on tables! And the other suit, he just got back from two weeks of alcohol rehab, and you're talking up the $1. shots! JESUS! Didn't you hear me muttering 'change subject'?""

""I thought you meant 'change the pose' !"" Jeeze.

She stares at me for a little bit, what can I say, I'm crest fallen.

""My boss hates these guys""

I perk up.

""And he is going to LOVE THIS! It was DELICIOUS! I've got to call him right away!"" and she reaches for the phone.

I grab her hand, ""Stop!, please don't. Can we just make this our little secret? Please please please. I'm so embarrassed"".

""OK, but remember, I can't be responsible for my actions after a few $1. shots at Happy Hour! haha""

And she just walked out the door with a little smirk on her face, we didn't even finish editing the photos.......",2020-07-09 06:49:22
"Why I Had To Walk Naked Across A Factory Floor, and Why I Can't Eat Peanut Butter. The greatest lesson in 3-phase motor rotation you'll ever read, and the latest Chris Boden story. Enjoy!",144,hmvn8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/hmvn8w/why_i_had_to_walk_naked_across_a_factory_floor/,17,1594132444.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/swqvjich4g951.jpg?width=3300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b01c6752fc06c66a32fd20a4361e5db0ab69333

Size matters, and I’m a skinny little shit.   
Despite the fact that I have the wingspan of an Albatross, I have the waist of a Dachshund. I’ve always been the skinny guy. As a result of that, I’ve been the go to person to be crammed into places other people wouldn’t fit for my entire life.

There’s a tiny locomotive, currently sitting in Coopersville. A diminutive, US Army 20-ton Whitcomb that looks more like a toy train than a real one. If you ever wondered what it would be like if you cross bred a SmartCar with a Diesel Locomotive, this is it. Decades ago, when I was a twelve-year-old boy, it was owned by the Muskegon Hysterical Society. One summer afternoon, when all the king’s coffee and all the king’s men couldn’t put Whitcomb together again, I was voluntold to wedge my skinny ass in there to help change out the carbon brushes on the motor. 

Railroad men don’t tend to run on the small side. Stumpy, sure, but even the “little” guys on a railroad tend to have thighs like tree trunks. They all crowded around the side of that little tan engine and watched me disappear inside through a tiny opening. I would reach out my hand with a set of brushes in it. Some nice gentleman that I couldn’t see, would take them and hand over a shiny new set. Then my hand would vanish back into the darkness of the engine bay. This process repeated and after a while a scrawny little fucker, covered in schmoo, emerged triumphant from the little door. 

The amount of times I’ve been the one to go into places other people either can’t fit or won’t go is off the fucking charts. Tight, deep, high, cold, dangerous, or inaccessible has been a recurring theme in my life for as long as I can remember. The odd thing is that I enjoy it - most of the time. There are certainly exceptions, though. When you spend a lot of time doing either confined space or high altitude work, you’re going to occasionally have at least a few unpleasant experiences. 

I’ve encountered a grease-tank the size of a small swimming pool in the basement of an abandoned smoked sausage factory that would not just give you nightmares, it would fuck you up for years. I’ll skip painting a vivid mental picture and simply say, you’ve never seen so many flies.

I’ve traversed a train bridge across the Grand River to explore a gigantic steel gear (it was a swing bridge in a former life), and seen a span the length of a football field that was completely covered in large, very well fed, spiders.

I once dropped into a utility vault and was all the way to the floor before we realised that we’d just come down a ladder that was two feet away from a wasp nest the size of a basketball. That was a bit scary, the terrifying part is that we were now inside a ten foot concrete cube and the only way out was back up that ladder. You couldn’t have got a pin up my ass with a jackhammer, and that is the day I learned how to run up a ladder.

But all those stories can wait for another day, because nothing, fucking nothing, compares to the peanut butter jacuzzi.

So, here is the story of why I can’t eat peanut butter.

For almost every school day of my entire misspent youth, we walked across the parking lot of the big, tan building on the corner of our neighborhood. It was the shortcut to the railroad tracks we hiked on our way to and from school. Never did we bother to learn what they actually made inside the factory, but once in a while we’d ride our bikes through the big pile of sawdust outside. 

When I was 19, my Dad’s company was hired to design and build a machine for them, and I got my first look at what they actually produced there.

Bird feeders - specifically suet cakes - and tons of them! Little blocks of suet or peanut butter, mixed with bird seed, that people put in backyard feeders for wild birds. Dad’s job was to build a machine that would prepare the peanut butter for the assembly line. 

It was a complicated machine with some interesting components; it looked like a large box about five foot cubed. There was a small hatch on top, about eight-by-twelve inches. It had a small ramp that sloped down to the hatch and was about two feet long. The ramp is where the operator would place a fifty-pound block of peanut butter. At that stage, the peanut butter was very similar to the stuff you’d find in a peanut butter cup, firm and almost crumbly.

The operator would place these peanut butter blocks on the ramp, slide them through the hatch, and then they would fall into the box. The only other openings to the box were where a driveshaft for the big mixing auger passed through right in the middle of the top, and a small hole about an inch in diameter on the bottom where the pipe was welded in place for the output.

Inside the box was a giant “mixing paddle” -  it was actually made from a snowblower auger. It was cheaper to buy a brand new one than to fabricate the part from scratch. The auger was the size you’d find in a garden-tractor-style snowblower. It stood on end, with a block of UHMW (Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) as a bearing on the top and bottom, and a driveshaft from a motor coming down from the top of the box. 

Everything was designed to be hosed down and cleaned, and the auger moved slowly on its axis, so just making the shaft end smooth and letting it ride in a hole in a block of UHMW worked perfectly. For applications like this, it’s the “poor man’s Teflon” and works great when you need something to slide against something else, while being wet or food safe because it will never rust.

The outside of the tank was wrapped in a beautiful and intricate zigzag of copper pipe that went  up and down all the way around the entire box. Hot water was pumped through the pipes to heat the entire tank and melt the peanut butter until it had the consistency of bearing grease so that it could be pumped down the line. The pipes were wrapped in an outer box shell and the space between the inner box and outer shell was filled with insulation.

The whole point was to load in about 1500 pounds of peanut butter, heat it until it melted into goop, mix it well, and send it down the pipe to be mixed with birdseed and then pooped out in little dollops into its packaging. It had to be melted, otherwise it was too thick to pump. Even the output pipe had to be wrapped with a heated water jacket or the peanut butter would solidify in the pipe and clog everything. Peanut butter is a pain in the ass to work with.

It was my job to wire up the machine that Dad had built. There wasn’t much to it, and I was thrilled at the chance to do such a serious and important job for Dad. I’d never wired up someone else’s project before, so even for something so simple, I was honored.

It wasn’t exactly rocket surgery, but I was an idiot apprentice at the time. The whole setup was run off a couple relays and thermostats. The machine was made to be set-and-forget. A motor for the output pump, a motor for the mixer, the pump and valve for the hot water… that was it - easy. No PLCs or anything fancy, just a thermostat, a couple motors, and a handful of relays in a little control box. It was as simple as it could be, and that was the point. It didn’t need to be fancy, it needed to be reliable.

I spent a whole weekend doing all of the wiring. I had a pretty solid idea of what I was doing, but I’d never worked with anything at this scale before. I didn’t even draw a schematic. It was simple, and I just kept it all in my head as I went. The first time I turned it on, one of the little Omron relays did a convincing impersonation of a grenade. A small mistake, but an expensive one. Dad got me a new relay after I changed a couple backwards connections and it came to life. 

I was ecstatic. I ran and got Dad and showed him my handiwork. I was standing there beaming at the magnificent contraption that I had brought to life. There really wasn’t anything to see, but the lights came on, the motor hummed, and the relays clicked. I was beaming with pride at my accomplishment.

Dad gave it a thorough check to see that everything was working just so, and asked me to hand him a screwdriver and a pair of dikes (diagonal wire cutters). I pulled them off the bench and watched him open up the control box, which puffed out with a massive wad of orange wires when he opened the door. The wad of wires floofed out like an afro to be proud of, and was easily double the size of the small enclosure from where it emerged.

Dad gave a sigh, and simply said, “Orange?”

Orange was the first spool of wire I’d grabbed… and the only one. It was simply the closest spool on the shelf, the right size, and had enough to do the whole job.

I stood there thinking about how it was going to take me a full five minutes to pack all that shit back in there as Dad calmly unplugged the machine, walked back over to the control box, and proceeded to give it a boot-camp haircut.

I didn’t know whether to shit or go blind.

“What the fuck, Dad? That took me two days! It worked! How the fuck am I supposed to know how to hook all that back up? I had a system!”

“It looks like the drippings from a drunken fuck,” he said, “There’s no way we hand off work like that to a client. What you made was a prototype, now make it pretty. If YOU can’t tell how the wires go together then sure as hell no one else can either. Someone will have to fix this someday. You owe it to them, the client, and me to make this not only work, but able to be fixed easily when it doesn’t. The guy who fixes this ten years from now might be you. Now do it right.”

And that was my lesson in craftsmanship. It was a lesson cemented into my brain over the many hours I spent meditating upon the thoughts like “I’ve quit better jobs than this” and doing a mental feasibility study on leaving a few slices of ham tucked deep in the cabin air vents of his truck.

There’s a lot of guys who talk about craftsmanship and never really bother to explain exactly what that is. Craftsmanship is the hours of work you put in when the job is done and the damn thing works fine, to make it not only work well, but make it pretty. It’s a mixture of engineering and art. 

Every young engineering student is taught that “Form Follows Function”. Craftsmanship is learning that “Form” can have an artistic aspect as well, and that “Function” can mean allowing it to be easier to repair,  easier to clean, etc. It’s not just taking into account the machine as it is today, but as it will be in the future decades to come.

Most people don’t think of skilled labor as a form of artistic expression, but ask any electrician, plumber, framer, or welder, and they will all tell you that craftsmanship is absolutely an artform. It’s just a form of art that only those that work in the field ever appreciate, to the rest of the world it’s invisible. 

Any electrician worth a damn can open a box and tell you the skill level of the original builder. They judge each other on such things constantly. It’s nuanced, subtle, and intricate. Every one of the trades does this in some way, and there’s just as much time, effort, and genius that goes into running conduit as there is for carving a marble sculpture or composing a symphony. We live in a world where the majority of our art is functional, invisible, and only appreciated by a silent army of people who are reluctant to share their secrets.

I spent another two days rewiring the machine, with proper color codes and wire routing. I spitefully used an entire bag of Dad’s good, expensive zip ties on the project. It was art.

I passed the subsequent inspection with flying colors and won the pride of my Dad.

Worth it.

A couple days later, we fumblefucked the machine on a truck and hauled it off to the factory to be installed. The millwrights did their thing and hoisted it up onto the 2nd floor mezzanine to be bolted in place. The plumbers did their thing and got the water heater hooked up. The electricians did their part and gave us a one-armed-bandit with 20 Amps of 3-phase 480. I’d done my part and was just there as a spectator. Like anyone else, I love hard work - I can watch it all day. 

I sat on a pallet and ate several handfuls of gigantic raisins that were originally destined as bird feed. They were fuckin massive, tasted amazing, and went well with the show. I couldn’t believe that raisins this big were used as bird feed. They were nothing like the ones you get in the little packs for lunch. I don’t know the story on why or whatnot, but I’ve never had raisins like this anywhere else in my entire life.

By the end of the day, the machine was completely installed and everything was ready to test. All of the assorted teams were standing around with a thumb up their ass, smoking cigarettes and eating raisins, and it was time to see if all our work was successful in real-world conditions.

Dad stood with the client and gave me the go-ahead. I proudly pushed the green button that started everything up on our machine. It hummed to life and everyone was pleased. Dad spent a couple minutes kibitzing with the shop manager and letting the machine warm up a bit. Then they told the guys to start loading the tank with blocks of peanut butter.

We all watched as the guys loaded the first thirty blocks into the tank. Thirty blocks doesn’t sound like much until you realize, that’s three-quarters of a ton of peanut butter! For several minutes, one at a time, we watched them open the box, pull out the bag, open the bag, set it on the ramp, and slide the block through the hatch. The few to land inside made a bang so loud I thought it might dent the tank, but after half a dozen it was just a mild WHUMP. 

It was cool watching something so mission-specific come to life, because we didn’t know exactly what to expect. This was an original and unique machine, so nobody knew just what it would sound like. Nobody knew its temperaments or personality yet. I was fascinated.

And then, it made a sound. 

A bad sound.

An expensive sound.

WHUMPUMPshhhhhhhhWHUMPUMPshhhhhhhhhWHUMPUMPshhhhhhh

Three people all moved at once to slam the EMERGENCY OFF switch.

There wasn’t any way to see inside the tank from the control panel. I knew the mixer was working because the motor on top was spinning, but there wasn’t anything on the outside of the box to actually see. The shafts and gearbox were all washdown rated and enclosed.  


It took about two minutes for us to figure out just what the hell was wrong. Dad grabbed a flashlight and looked through the hatch and saw that the auger was all cattywampus with the top end hanging from the lovejoy at a painful angle, and the bottom fucked off into a corner of the little square at the bottom of the tank about 4 inches from where it wanted to be.  As he explained this, I turned as red as the emergency button they had pushed moments before.

I had wired mixer motor for the giant snowblower auger in such a way that it was spinning in the wrong direction. Instead of pulling the contents at the center of the tank upward, it was pushing down on it and the tank top had just enough give that when a rather solid chunk of peanut butter got wedged in between the auger and the bottom of the tank, it had climbed up out of its lower bearing block and started flopping around inside the tank.

The whole thing only moved at about one revolution per second, but it moved with authority and was chunking around against the inside of a big metal tank. Needless to say, it made a sound...

It was a trivial thing to fix. To change the direction of any three-phase motor all you have to do is disconnect any two of the three power feed wires and reverse them. It took me less than a minute with a screwdriver to get the motor turning in the proper direction.

The problem was that someone still had to get the end of the auger shaft seated back in its bearing block, and that was inside the bottom of the tank...

Which was only accessible through the tiny hatch where the peanut butter goes in...

Which was now heated to a hundred degrees fahrenheit...

Nobody said a word, nobody ever ordered me in there - they didn’t have to. There was a ten second meeting without a single word being said and where everyone gave me “that look”. It was clear that I had been voluntold.

They turned off the heat and I propped open the hatch with a piece of 2x4 that was sitting on the floor. One of the millwrights got a blower with a long yellow tube about 6 inches in diameter and stuffed it through the hatch to blow fresh air inside.

I stripped off my shirt, emptied my pockets, and started towards the tank when Dad cleared this throat.

“Um, Son, are you planning on walking home tonight?”

“Uhhhhhhh… no? Why?”

“Because if you wear those pants in there you’re not fuckin’ sitting in my truck.”

“Oh, shit… yeah……… um… I have a problem...”

“What’s that?”

“I’m… uh… I’m not wearing any underwear.”

The millwrights, the electricians, the plumbers, the client, the shop guys, and no small compliment of the line workers all got a laugh out of that one.

“You ain’t got nothing we all haven’t seen before, figure it out.”

I painfully regretted the fact that I hadn’t worn underwear since I was in elementary school, but luckily I didn’t have much time to think about it. I stripped buck naked, but put my shoes back on for protection and slipped feet-first through the hatch into the peanut butter hot tub. A pair of guys manned the hatch with the blower and held a couple flashlights looking inside so that I could see, and so they could keep an eye on me and make sure I didn’t die.

It was... disgusting. The goopy mess was everywhere, instantly. At this point in my life I had long hair that hung in a ponytail halfway to my ass. The tank was over half full and I had to face upwards, reaching behind me to keep my face above the surface and still get the shaft in the hole. It took me perhaps five whole minutes to do the job, but you’d be amazed how many weeks of time can pass in five minutes when you’re the guy in the tank.

The shaft dropped in the hole with a THUNK, and the top of the tank shook. The sound was deafening, but it marked my success. Immediately, I reached out the hatch, and a pair of hands pulled me out into the cold, and now, painfully bright room. I was hauled out the hatch, dripping with hot sticky peanut butter that now covered every single inch of my entire body except for my face.

The small group of perhaps a dozen guys had grown to well over two dozen men (and a few women) when I came out of there, and they all applauded and cheered like I’d just taken the stage at Woodstock. Every single person in the whole damn shop, even all of the workers from the assembly lines, had come running to see the freakshow. The whole damn factory was at a standstill just to watch my stupid ass emerge naked and covered in slimy peanut butter from that tank. I cannot begin to express how sincerely thankful I am that this happened back in the early 90’s before everyone walked around with a camera in their pocket.

I marched my dripping, skinny, shivering, naked ass all the way to the other end of the facility where I was able to get hosed off.. By the time I’d gotten there, about a block and a half in total, the peanut butter had hardened and I was scraping it off in gobs. The moment it got hit with the hose though, it became a strange combination of hard, waxy, greasy, and even more disgusting. Eventually, I was able to get to some manner of reasonably clean. 

Getting the peanut butter out of my hair was a nightmare that lasted several more showers, however, it came with a weird upside - my hair felt amazing.

My shoes, however, would never be quite right again.

I got dressed, and now that I wasn’t buck naked and dripping with shit, I got to ride on the little electric cart back to the other end of the factory. The machine was running in full swing and eating blocks of peanut butter at a rate of about three a minute. The line was happy, the client was happy, Dad was happy, and everyone in the whole place had enjoyed the most memorable line upgrade in their history.

To this day, I cannot eat peanut butter.

But, I’ll never forget to test the phasing on my motors again!",2020-07-07 17:34:04
The only men in a law firm with 11 woman. She fucking touched my asshole,80,hk4v9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/hk4v9e/the_only_men_in_a_law_firm_with_11_woman_she/,6,1593722133.0,"Ok Guys, let me tell you the story of my last two years of working in a law firm as a single men between 11 other woman:

I will give my best to write in English. Also I want to make sure that you know that I do not care about what your gender is or what you believe in etc. Human is human. Just to point this out as this is kind of a man/woman topic. 

When you work in an office you might know that things can get nasty and sometimes you have to deal with strange people but what I found myself in this time must have been kind of the headquarter of office crazyness. 

After graduation I joined a very specialized consulting industry and worked there for 4 years. I hated it but rest of my life was good so let´s keep going. 

I got fired and worked self employed for arround 8 months and as it was slowly but constantly growing I thought about the option of just staying self employed. There was one law firm in my country, dealing with this sector of the law so I got in contact with them to make them my client. 

Fast forward: I was invited three times for lunch and at the end they made me an offer to hire me. They wanted me to look into their processes and after around half a year I was supposed to do business development. This was the main reason for me to take that offer. 

When I started my first weeks there it came to my attention that everyone in this company is kind of fucked up, hating management, back stabbing each other like hell, totally unhappy and some of them even more. (More about that down below.) However, it were the first weeks and you kind of want to find your place in that structure and focus on good work at all. 

I discovered that there are absolutely no sales activies or any kind of client relationship management. No tracking of nothing. You can say that there was almost no management. Just people doing very easy work for a very overpriced fee. It came out that one of the global players was using them as main contractor for our country and this made a value of arround 80% of the whole company revenue. That is the only reason why this law firm existed at all. This global player started going through hard times so I guess that was the main reason of getting me into that company.  

After updating some processes I focussed on establishing a healthy basis of the very minimum from an economical point of view. They liked my changes but were not willed to provide their part in the change process. Long story short, basically whatever they did, they did because they just feel like to do it. No changes at all ever happend. 

Let´s talk about the general setup:

Company of about 10 people plus 2 owner. All woman. I am the only man. Later another male joint but instantly left after enjoying the daily life there for a couple of weeks. 

**Lawyer 1:**

5 years before retirement. She got berserk crazy at her last job and went to a mental health hospital for a while instead of jail. She was known for this tasty smell of alcohol and she only came to the office when she wanted to come to the office. As she was the main contact person for our ""80% of all client"" she was allowed to do whatever the fuck she wanted. 

One day me and one assistant have been in her office when she started to scream into her bookshelf, saying that she knows that the cameras and micros are hidden there. So she basically was screaming to a couple of books as if they would have been our two managers watching her. She then started threatening them to kill them with a baseball bat and so on. Overall she was the best colleague that I had in that office. :-)  

**Lawyer 2:**

""I do not vacinate my children."" 

""I do not eat meat. Why do you eat meat?"" 

""Do you know that your food is not healthy at all?"" 

Today I would call her Karen :-) She basically had the biggest workload from all lawyers. She was slow as fuck, doing over hours for free, never complaining, never talking, not able to make decisions and willed to accept a very low payment. She sits there for like forever. Almost perfect crew member if you want to establish Colonia Dignidat II 

**Lawyer 3:**

Black belt in back stabbing and declared herself to be super important. If you asked her for anything she usually said: ""I need to discuss this with my team"" (Her team was one half time person and she had a name) When I checked the workload from them I discovered that she and her assistant basically...let´s say they usually had a relaxed day. It came out they are just sitting there in deep hate for the two manager but without having any other option because of their children being to young. Looking back, I cannot complain at all. Did the same at the end and teamed up with them. One day after a review meeting with owner 2 she told me that she started the topic of becoming a partner or things like that to move forward but owner 2 told her that she – so lawyer 3 herself – decided against a career when getting her second child. 

The assistant got pregnant and asked for a new chair as her very old one was very bad for her back. They approved the chair but wanted her to get it herself as they wantet to save delivery costs. I ended up driving her to a store to pick up a chair like 5 months before I finally got fired. 

**Assistant 1**

This was the most crazy person that I´ve ever met in my life I guess. She can be super crazy happy or hardcore desperate. There is nothing in between. No self esteem, not even a little. Her main goal was to get attention at any price. Officially she had a Bachelor and Master in law but in reality she had not even a little idea of legal work techniques. How is that even possible? 

She had a DUI with cocaine and alcohol and killed someone on the road with her car. She got two years for that as it was her first crime ever. How do I konw? Well, she likes to tell the story. Even to her colleagues and Manager. However, for an assistant she was spending a shitload of money for beauty treatments and holidays. Nobody knows where the money comes from. The other day one of my colleagues passed her desk and saw some strange looking aluminum balls in her open upper compartment of the desk so he asked what it was. She explained that this is cocaine and she prefers to store it at work instead of her home because you never know who visits early in the morning. 

When I was alone the other evening in my office she came and thought that I look stressed and offered me a massage. I said no but she already started touching me. As I explained more drastically that I do not want that she scratched my neck so hard that you saw three stripes of blood on it and the middle one was so deep that it took some time to stop bleeding. Did anyone saw that? Yes. Did anyone care? No. I should have taken action at that point. 

Another time she wanted something from me and I declined so she threatend me to tell everyone that I harassed her sexually. Luckily many of the colleagues where in close distance. I could have fired her in that moment but I did not do it. Why? I do not know to be honest. 

A couple of months before I left I was in the kitchen and she and another assistant approached me from behind as I felt a hand touching my butt. Not in a gentle way (would have not been better but to give you an idea) but more like trying to get her finger into me. They both were laughing and I guess it was her. Why would you do that? In an office? In a law firm? What has to happen that you feel save doing this with witnesses in a law firm? Just crazy. 

**Owner 1**

Gay woman and married to owner 2. No problem with that

She is a 100% hardcore narcissus.  Basically she used the company as kind of her own stage to enlighten the world with her presence. Whenever she got praised or landed some shitty interview with a shitty radio station or something she had to make sure that the world knows about it. One day the law firm got picked from a magazin in my coutry to be the best law firm in our sector. (They covered all sectors so I guess they needed someone for our sector) I have to mention that we are the only law firm in the whole coutry, providing (heavily overpriced) service for this industry. She was like...I cannot describe but she taught me what it really means to deal will a nacissus. 

When I entered they asked me to find a way to exclude global players from doing such work like we do in our country on their own as you make the most money out of it from all services in that industry. I made a plan to gather all single lawyers in that industry (there are a few but basically too small to count as competitor at all) and the responsible legal chambers to declare this kind of work to be legal work and therefore can only be performed by lawyers. (It is not based on government officials confirming that but this is another topic) However, a couple of days later she announced to the whole team that SHE had an idea.....One year later and it worked. Everyone working in that industry stopped performing that specific part of the work and asked us to do it because they were afraid of any legal problems.  

**Owner 2**

Also kind of a god like persona because she is a lawyer. Beside of that she was known to not really work anymore. Nobody knows what she is doing on her desk all day but without any doubt she was the most hated person in that office. 

She was using pen and paper to track invoices that need to get paid. We tried to change this to a digital way which was almost impossible. At the end we agreed that she will use an excell sheet instead at least. This ended up in hiring a person to take care of that excell sheet as she was not able to use excell. 

She was the one making salary payments manually each months. In 20 months she managed to forget to pay me 4 (!!!) times. 

If you remember, I agreed to this position in order to get into business development. One day we got aware that our 80% client was recovering so they decided that there is no need anymore to do sales. (One single client with value of 80% in the portfolio and there is no need for sales???) When I asked what they think we can do about my agreement and the fact that I will not have any chance to get comission they just told me that we need to postpone it because the company is in bad conditions....

In the second year I wanted to change my health insurance. In my country you can basically decide on your own as employee and just inform your employer about it. She wanted me to pay for her accountant who would need to change my data accordingly. It is highly illegal to do it like that in my country but a god like peron is above the law of course. 

So, that´s it. If you reached this point of my story, thank you very much for your attention. Maybe you ask yourself why I accepted the above without doing anything? Fair enough. 

Well, I got a degree in law and economics but unfotunately joined this industry. I was not aware that I make a big mistake. I am responsible for that, yes. It came out that this is an industry that only requires you to speak at least a little english and to have two arms as well as to be willed to accept people like the above. The whole industry is like that. Having this in my CV closes a lot of doors but I was not aware of that when I started my journey after university. I pretty much fucked up from the beginning and have to pay the price obviously. 

The reason why I did not leave the company earlier or took any kind of legal action is that I turn into some kind of survial mode when things like that happen on a daily basis. At first you are like: ""Ok, I make it to the weekend and have two days of peace"". After that it turns into: ""Ok, I make it to this evening and have a couple of hours of peace"" Final stage is: ""Ok, I make it to lunch break"" 

It is hard to describe but my whole working life so far was shit. Not always like the above but I tell you, this industry is crazy. While I enjoyed my ride through the office hell my mom died of cancer so only my father and my little brother are left. That also takes a critical amount of energy I can tell you but this is not part of this story.  

Right now I am unemployed and looking for jobs of course. Let´s see. The 80% client left at the beginning of 2020 and they now had corona to fire some people without blaming themselfs. 

Have my peace for three months now. Of course I need money. Hell yes but I still have problems to sleep. I want to forget everything that has happend. It affected me more than I want to. Writing this and sharing this with you guys already feels good. I should talk more about it. 

I very much hope, that I will find a nice job some day to make peace finally. I am sure this will happen. 

To everyone out there, being in a similar position: You´re not alone. Keep going and do it better than me.",2020-07-02 23:35:33
"An epic story of near death, working salvage in an abandoned paper mill and awakening a sleeping giant.",113,hjhkf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/hjhkf3/an_epic_story_of_near_death_working_salvage_in_an/,14,1593632841.0,"I know what the end of the world sounds like, I was there.

By the turn of the millenium, the paper industry around Kalamazoo, Michigan was a wasteland of gigantic buildings, superfund sites, and rough neighborhoods. Even a small paper mill employs a few thousand people, and the area had lost seven of them in the past few decades. Every one of the “Seven Sisters” had died with a whisper. If it wasn’t for the university, the town would have dried up entirely. As it was, most of the area, and especially the smaller towns, were hanging by a thread. The city motto should be “Kalamazoo, a great place to be from!”

The mammoth GPI paper mill was less than a quarter mile from our workshop and had been sitting abandoned for years. Thanks to some local support we got permission to “Take anything but the paint” provided we could haul it out within a two-week window before the demolition crew began their work. We literally signed our lives away on release forms, and the security guard shook his head and smiled when he gave us a key. For half a month we backed up a twenty-foot long aging box truck with a questionable transmission, and sucked the marrow from the dying bones of industry to feed our little community makerspace.

We had a blast. For a team of young nerds and engineers this was like Mardi-Gras and Christmas combined. We explored every inch of the half-mile-long building and filled our truck dozens of times over with shelving, valves, Allen Bradley switchgear, metal stock, and tooling that dated back several wars. Most of it would have been worthless to the scrap companies, but to us it was treasure that would become parts for some of our most famous projects for the next fifteen years.

Anything of real value had already been stripped out. The giant machines had all been sold at auctions years ago. The meth-heads took most of what was left, stripping the wire from the walls. Every conduit was empty, pigtails only a few inches long left hanging out. Tens of thousands of dollars in copper, all to feed someone’s addiction.

The facility was a cavernous, post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s the kind of place they use for movie sets and photography shoots. There were jagged pipes and conduits, razor sharp and jutting out at odd angles. There were holes large enough to drop a city bus through that went down three floors, where gigantic paper machines once sat. The entire place was festooned with “ankle-breakers”, sets of four bolts, sticking up from the concrete floor where some control stand or grinder or something was once bolted down, waiting for the next person who didn’t pay very close attention where they stepped.

In a world where everyone has turned into a pussy, with people making careers out of being offended on the behalf of other people, and with lawyers having worked with insurance companies to take all of the good honest fun out of getting your hands dirty and doing something dangerous, this was heaven for a twenty-something country boy. My weirdo friends and I were having the time of our lives.

We wandered,shopped, and explored for a week before we noticed it. I was fifteen feet in the air, trying to unbolt an old electric fire alarm horn from a steel beam, and just by chance  happened to glance to my left. There, nestled in between a pair of I-beams, was what looked like three large 4-inch pipes. Only the ribbed texture gave it away. I rubbed a small spot, taking fifty years of paper dust and pigeon shit off with my thumb, and showing a beautiful, faded, red jacket underneath.

It wasn't a pipe; it was a cable. It was gigantic cable! It was copper cable. I followed its path and saw that it went up to the very top of the ceiling, across the roof struts of the main gallery, down the other side and vanished through the floor. The room that I was in was forty-feet high, and it was easily two-hundred feet across the gallery.

The only reason this was still there was because it was so well hidden, tucked away in the beams and camouflaged in the grunge. The meth-head scrappers were so caught up in the half-inch and other small EMT conduits they’d never thought to look for the main power feeds that supplied whole sections of the plant.

The problem was, how in the hell were we going to get it down? This stuff weighs about fifteen-pounds to the foot. It’s thicker than my arm, and comprised of three stranded cables, each over an inch thick, entwined in padding and insulation, and all wrapped in a metallic shell with a red plastic outer jacket. It’s tough, heavy, and worth several dollars a pound...

...that is if you can move it, if you can cut it, and if you can get it out of the ceiling without killing yourself.

I got on my radio and the whole team assembled. We all had a quiet freakout when the team realized the gravity of our discovery, and also how hard it would be to get it out of there. Certainly, this was a great place to have to push, pull, lift, and haul tons of materials at once. The problem was that none of the old material-handling equipment was there anymore, and we didn’t have any kind of power to use tools as it was. The building was a long dead carcass at this point, and we were the absolute last team that would be in there before giant machines turned the whole place into tidy piles of steel, concrete, stainless, and glass.

We needed a plan, and one that would work on human power. 

We all headed back to the lab and assembled every harness, rope, comealong, and sling we could find. I pulled out my climbing bags and non-industrial harnesses as well. The next morning we all met at the lab, and then headed over to “Site-T” as we had come to call it. Now, we had a whole new mission.

This old abandoned building was about to become fundraising for our little nonprofit and help us keep the heat on all winter.

We set to work with slings and come-alongs. A come-along (pronounced without the hyphen and in three smashed together syllables while holding a Vernor’s and smoking a Camel), is a lever-actuated ratchet and pawl winch. Smaller ones have a piece of aircraft cable that winds around a drum, and larger ones use a chain and cog mechanism that can let an average man rip a tree out of the ground. They’re small, portable, don’t require electricity or gasoline, and are incredibly powerful. They’re also dangerous as hell if you don’t know what you’re doing. If an attachment slips, if you overload one, or if anything lets go they can slingshot the tail and that piece of aircraft cable moving at Mach speed will slice you to the bone before you even know you’re bleeding.

Stupid hurts and scars carry lessons.

The cables ran in a metal tray for most of their length. The tray was steel, and looked like a ladder with flat rungs. Like everything else in the whole place, it was covered in eighty-years of paper dust that formed a hard, grey shell on everything. The parts up in the main gallery had an extra layer of pigeon shit, just for flavour.

It was slow work with hacksaws and flashlights. A single piece, about three-feet-long was about as much as you wanted to carry at one time if you had to walk any real distance. In most cases, it was about a 2-city-block walk back to the truck. So we worked in teams, some cutting, and most hauling. It was filthy, grueling, exhausting work that went on for days.

After getting all of the low-hanging fruit, it was time to get the main runs down from the ceiling. We’d cut the ends back at the switchgear cabinets free as high as we could reach while standing on the cabinets. But that still left about twenty feet of cables hanging from the ceiling. From there they ran all the way across the gallery and down the other side. They went through a hole in each floor with a bunch of other pipes and conduits. At the bottom they made a bend in the lowest floor, a sub-basement about seventy feet down from the top of the run up in the roof. The bottom run was suspended in a tray along the ceiling of the basement and ran through the maze of pipes that fed the old mill.

We’d gotten everything we could easily reach, and now it was time for the hard stuff.

With a hodgepodge of slings tied to everything we could reach that was solidly bolted down, we hooked up to just one of the three cables. The plan was to pull them out, one at a time, and let them just pile up on the floor. We’d cut it, haul it, and then pull the next one down. The only thing left holding the cables in place at this point was gravity, but there was a hell of a lot of gravity in one of these cables.

There was also, we learned quickly, a lot of stretch. 

We were spread out along the length of the run. A small group was working the winches in the basement, the rest were stationed in ones and twos strung from hell to breakfast. We all had our radios and were in communication, but for the most part it was a nearly silent process that involved a lot of standing around and smoking a cigarette while watching nothing much happen.

I was up in the ceiling, sitting on a pair of old steam pipes that ran parallel to the cable tray. I was at the top level, about ten feet from the last bend where they dropped down to terminate at the switchgear cabinets. My job was simple, report when it started to move. Once the end of the cable passed by me, my job was to inch along with it and give progress reports. We knew it would take hours to pull it out of there. I got comfortable and listened to the cable tick quietly as they slowly worked the ratchet a quarter-mile away from me.

The basement team worked slowly, a synchronized team all working their levers together in time. I could hear the sound of them ratcheting their come-alongs as it echoed up from the depths of the mill across the cavernous gallery where I sat.

The quiet of the mill was awesome. Every few seconds I would hear the cable tick off in the distance ahead of me. They were pulling on the far end, and ever so slowly they were putting more and more tension on the cable. By now it was easily several thousand pounds at the far end. It was fascinating to realise that something so big, so heavy, could actually stretch. Their end had already moved by a few feet, while mine sat perfectly still.

Then suddenly…..BRRRRRT! The cable moved about six inches and I nearly pissed myself. It was loud, damn loud, and I startled out of my daydreaming when the whole tray made the sound as the ribbed surface of the cable dragged over the rungs in the tray. A dozen pigeons took flight from the rafters and either went out the smashed windows near the ceiling or did laps around the gallery before picking a new spot to sit. It sent a shower of dust and birdshit raining down on the gallery, falling into the giant holes below and settling into the darkness. 

The radio cracked to life as everyone checked in. We were all fine, but we all had a healthy dose of fear. We knew we’d awoken a sleeping Giant, and we all had a serious respect for the dangerous combination of energy, weight, and heights we were working with. This was especially true for my dumb ass perched up in the rafters sitting only a few feet from the Giant’s tail.

The dust settled and the silence was again broken by the ratcheting off in the depths of the mill and the rhythmic ticking of the cable. Every thirty seconds or so the tension would release as the cable shifted with a BRRRRRRRT and moved along another six inches.

This was going to take a while.

I got comfortable, I enjoyed the view from my perch and passed the time smoking cigarettes and keeping track of the slow climb of the end of the cable. Over the next hour the pattern of the ticks and the BRRRRTs had stayed pretty constant and while progress was slow, it was consistent.

After an hour or two, the pattern started to change, and that got my attention. The cable went BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT for a solid ten seconds, which is a lifetime in that situation, and moved about two feet. 

My asshole did a fantastic impersonation of a rabbit’s nose.

This was a lot more than the six or eight inches we had been getting. I got on the radio and asked if everything was ok and everyone said they were fine. I told them about the development on my end, and everyone along the length had seen or heard it as it happened. We took this as good progress, and continued on.

Things started moving a lot faster now. We all woke up from our cable-pulling trance and focused. The Giant was stirring.

The cable started moving a few feet at a time, a few times a minute. The basement team kept pulling, and I could see the end just over the edge from the switchgear area. We’d moved the whole run almost twenty feet.

BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth 

That was different…...the cable moved about ten feet and I saw the end flop up and over the turn at the switchgear area. It was maybe five feet from my perch. The whole cable moved, and then shifted gears and slowed down to a crawl before stopping. Before it had just stopped.

You couldn't get a pin up my ass with a jackhammer. I heard the radio say “Look alive! Shit’s moving!” and I replied to the team with “Everyone be ready to run and find a shady spot”.

A minute later, it did it again, BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth and I watched the end drag on past me. I turned in my perch and debated following it along the pipes up here, or climbing down and watching from the slightly safer vantage point of the ground. See, up here, there was no way I could get out of the way. At least on the ground I could run. 

I was just off to the side of the pipes, standing on the unistrut racks over the switchgear cabinets with my head just under the cable tray when it happened.

BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

And that’s when the world exploded.

The cable didn’t slow down, it accelerated, quickly. The forces had reached their tipping point and there was a lot more gravity pulling down on the vertical run than there was friction from the long horizontal run. We had given it a gentle nudge of a few tons and once it had reached the tipping point, gravity took over. Several tons of cable was now in motion, turning potential into kinetic energy and building inertia. The fundamental forces of the universe were thrashing to come back into balance. It was like watching entropy have a bad acid trip.

I hugged the unistrut rack I was climbing on, being very aware of the vulnerability and openness of my current position and tried very hard not to piss down my leg. I mostly succeeded.

The sound was deafening. People always describe things like this as comparing them to a freight train. Fuck your freight train. I’ve stood next to a thousand freight trains over the years and none of them sounded even remotely like this. The ribbed conduit flew over the rungs in the cabletray and sounded like a thousand chainsaws competing in the Indy500 while being shelled with naval artillery. The loose end of the cable, now moving at highway speeds whipped into mounts and pipes and hangers and destroyed anything it touched, exploding into a rain of shrapnel and dust. The entire ceiling turned into a plume of birdshit and paper dust, and the building shook to its foundations as the cable made the corner from the rafters to the drop and flew from its vertical run to just land limp on the concrete floor in a gigantic pile.

The silence was even more deafening than the armageddon I had just experienced. The echos took half a minute to die out in the bowels of the old mill.

The radio went apeshit as a dozen people all tried to see how many of us had died. God had smiled on us, though some of us would have to change our shorts, nobody had so much as a scratch. A couple members of the team didn’t stop running until they were on the other end of the building, one even ran all the way outside and it was still falling after they made it out there.

It felt like we had slayed a Giant.  We all gathered at the Giant’s pile on the floor of the main gallery. There was a smaller pile in the basement, but the cable had bent and hung up here and dropped the majority of itself in a tangle. We were thankful for that, it saved having to haul it up a few flights of stairs. We all took a minute to just breathe, have a smoke, and let the adrenaline pass. None of us were expecting such an experience, but there wasn’t a person standing there who didn’t have a smile on their face.

We headed out for a couple hours, to get a quick shower, change our clothes, and grab something to eat. But every single one of us was back at the lab, ready to go shortly after. We went back to the old mill and repeated the experience, twice, by morning.

It took us days to get the piles cut to portable pieces. We got smart though, and learned we could haul them up to the door in fifty-foot lengths by dragging them as a team. Then we’d cut them up near the truck and just load them on.

The scrap value from all that cable paid the rent, kept the lights on, and fed the team for quite a while. The experience of nearly dying in the rafters of a paper mill though, that was priceless.

I enjoy being happy in dangerous ways, and I can now say, I know what the end of the world sounds like.",2020-07-01 22:47:21
Three Hundred Buckets - The shittiest job I've had in years.,32,hjhgna,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/hjhgna/three_hundred_buckets_the_shittiest_job_ive_had/,4,1593632527.0,"I’ve seen some shit.

The building could only be described as fetid. The mephitic atmosphere punched you in the face when you walked in the door. Years of sweat, stale cigarette smoke, and an overtone of patchouli oil from thousands of college kids with questionable hygiene and an exuberance for body spray had left their stench. It had more funk than James Brown and the assault on the nose was as much a part of the local legend of the place as the music that shook it to its foundations every weekend. Welcome to the famous, and now former, Rocketstar Cafe.

It was the summer of 2008, and I was still living in Kalamazoo, Michigan at the time. Kalamazoo is a town that people just end up in. You just wake up one morning, and there you are. Nobody sets out to live there, and the majority of new people are college students just passing through. But it’s a fun town if you do it right, with hot and cold running pussy and a much more chill vibe than the neighboring cities. It’s way more laid back than Grand Rapids, which has more churches than gas stations and a population of people that put bible verses on their business cards. The only other option was Battle Creek, the eastern anchor of the rust belt. An industrial shithole with a beautiful, but miniscule downtown that looks like a hickey on a hemorrhoid. K’zoo wasn’t great, but it was bearable for a while.

We were working on what was originally the Rocketstar Cafe and what was now the empty shithole at the corner of West Michigan and Sprague. It was owned by a raging alcoholic piece of shit absentee slumlord. Our job was to clean it up and turn it into a new cafe and computer shop. 

Two weeks before, I was standing on the sidewalk outside the Rocketstar on a beautiful summer night as they gasped their last bong hit before going out of business. True to form, it was packed. The entire front room was shoulder to shoulder and the whole crowd moved as one, entranced by the sounds of shoegazer music from the overdriven amps of a locally famous college band. I watched the entire crowd gain and lose six inches of altitude every few seconds as the entire floor structure did a “hold my beer” and all I could do was hold my breath. 

Miraculously, the night ended without any more incident than someone getting smacked around for picking on BoomBox Ronnie. BoomBox Ronnie was a local trustee of modern chemistry and gangsta rap that was shooting for the high-score in the chromosome game. He’s a walking freakshow but a genuinely sweet kid with real heart. Say what you like about K’zoo, but that whole town will line up to kick your ass if you fuck with BoomBox Ronnie. I quietly hope he runs for mayor someday, he’d win, and that would be tremendously poetic. He’s the hero that Kalamazoo deserves.

As anyone who ever hung out at the Rocketstar knows, the old hardwood floors were bouncy and mushy just about everywhere in the entire front room.. Every week there would be a band up front by the windows towards the street, and a packed crowd of sweaty students stomping, bouncing, and swaying all the way to the back. The music was good, the weed was cheap, and getting a blowjob in the back room of the Rocketstar was a right of passage for half the freshman class of any given year.

But now, that was all closed down. We had a summer to clean the fuck out of this place - fix the plumbing, the electrical, the HVAC,  the floors - and build a new business that was scheduled to be open come September. We worked twelve-hour days through the summer heat; it was a job I’d never forget.

The floors, we soon discovered, weren’t just soggy and bouncy... they were rotting to shreds.

We went down into the dirt-floor basement and looked up overhead with a flashlight. The entire underside of the floor was white, green, black, grey, and tan. It was everything BUT wood. In fact, you could barely see any wood at all. It was completely covered in mold. In most places it was over a quarter-inch-thick. I’d never seen anything like it. Without a moment of hesitation or reservation I said “this goes, right now, all of it” and we all shifted from that easy introductory phase of any new jobsite into action.

One team went low with masks, gloves, putty knives, and buckets. They started scraping off the mold. The other team went high with crowbars and rage, and started ripping off floorboards. We all filled dumpsters. It was disgusting, but in two days we had the flooring stripped off down to the open joists and could really see what the situation was.

The situation was…we needed a hell of a lot of new floor joists, these were sponge. The only thing holding this floor up was habit. We spent a week replacing joists and airing out the building. The air was thick, musty, and smelled like a peat bog. One by one we ripped out the stubbed ends of the rotten old joists, half of the center spans of which had just crumbled away. One by one we replaced all of them with fresh new pieces of lumber. 

The entire process took us a week and a half in the blistering summer heat. For the first few days there was so much humidity from the basement as it dried out, that the windows on the front of the building would be covered in condensation if we left the doors closed too long.

And then, something miraculous happened. Something none of us expected. The basement floor did something quite remarkable...

It sprouted.

The entire basement floor was just a generic, boring, “Michigan Basement” with a dirt floor. We never thought anything of it. The previous tenants never went down there, and until the day we discovered the mold, neither did we. But now, that dingy, dirt floor had turned  green. Hundreds of tiny little green shoots had appeared, because for the first time in forever, (since we’d ripped out the floor) there was sunlight down there, and lots of it. 

We had to go explore this. So we all went down and checked it out. While we were down there I noticed an old furnace boiler sitting, half sunken into the floor off to the side of the stairs. It was a rusted hulk and someone was going to tear open a leg on it if we left it there, so I asked a couple guys to haul it off to the dumpster.

It was while they were removing it that they discovered it was sitting on a concrete base, about two feet down under the furnace. They asked me what to do about it and I went to get a look. I grabbed a shovel and hopped into the hole. I was standing on the concrete base with the dirt around me coming up mid-thigh, and I started digging around the edges. I wanted to see how big the base was, so we could determine if we should remove it or not. I couldn’t find an edge in the five minutes I was prepared to fuck with it, so I asked the guys to just dig until they hit the edge and then let me know. I told them to put the dirt in a five-gallon bucket or two and just empty it out in the dumpster. No big deal.

I went back to working on the floor joists and didn’t think anything of it. 

A couple hours later, one of them walked past me carrying a bucket and my mental clock gave me a “what the hell?” so I followed him down.

The concrete pad was now about ten feet square.

What….the fuck.

The basement boys were very happy when we mobilised the entire crew. We all teamed up and everyone started filling or hauling buckets of dirt out to the dumpster. Everywhere we dug, there was smooth concrete underneath. Eventually we got to the walls and confirmed our suspicion. It turns out the basement didn’t have a dirt floor, he basement had a complete concrete floor! Some stupid fuck had filled the entire basement with dirt.

But…why?

Our first thought was that someone had done it to grow weed. It would make sense, and explain a lot of things. We thought we had discovered the remnants of a gigantic grow operation where they were growing a whole room full of pot and selling it right upstairs to thousands of eager, happy customers.

That was our first thought. Sadly, reality was so much worse.

The building had been a cafe of some sort for years and years. Well, restaurants are required to have a special type of drain with an air-gap. The upstream pipe just stops for a couple inches and drains into a larger diameter piece of pipe below. You’ll see air-gap drains all over the place in restaurants because…………... The vast majority of the time they work just fine.

This one, however, did not. The downstream line had clogged at some point, and the upstream never got the message. Nobody ever went down into the basement, the landlord never came to inspect anything, the management changed with the seasons and nobody ever really gave a shit. So for years, it just quietly went on draining raw sewage onto the floor. 

We hadn’t been shoveling dirt, we were shoveling composted human shit and restaurant waste! Together we had hauled well over three-hundred buckets of human shit out of the basement of the Rocketstar. I had never felt like I needed a shower more than the day we figured that out. 

Our cafe never opened, and we got out of there as fast as we could. The absentee drunk landlord sold the place to an even more evil cunt, a shady parasite with a mean-streak and a Jimmy Durante nose who runs a “Cash For Books” gig scamming broke college kids. We got out of there and never looked back.

So, next time I say I’ve seen some shit - believe it.",2020-07-01 22:42:07
Racing Bearings with Compressed Air and How Mikey Nearly Died - A late night in the shop.,115,hjcsww,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/hjcsww/racing_bearings_with_compressed_air_and_how_mikey/,23,1593618461.0,"The greatest argument against evolution is that the average man survives puberty. 

It was a miserable, blustery, autumnal evening in the early 2000’s. Three of us were working late into the evening finishing up processing a massive donation of some corporation’s junk. See, that’s one of many shitty parts of owning a nonprofit; companies often use you as a trash service. 

Pretty much everything you think you know about the administrative side of the nonprofit world is made of spin, marketing, or outright bullshit. Nobody wants to say this, and it’s career suicide for anyone who actually works in the industry to call them out on their fuckery, but that’s just how it is. Here’s one of a million examples.

Companies, and I mean a lot of them, often donate equipment to various non-profits. Shit rolls downhill, and with the glorious power of a 501(c)(3) certification you now have the ability to empower someone with a tax writeoff when they give you just about anything as a donation.

Now, this is great for things like giant checks and foundation support, but those are incredibly rare. The problem is, people have figured out how to use these deductions by donating outright trash, and that turns many nonprofits into disposal centers. Volunteer at any small place in your local community sometime, and you’ll see the absolute garbage that people drop off to Churches, Youth Centers, and a many thousands of other nonprofits.

Countless thousands of hours of human lives have been pissed away sorting through truckloads of other companies' trash hoping to find anything useful. It’s a giant scam and a level of heinous fuckery most foul - here’s how it works.

The value of anything is a matter of how it’s perceived; and perception is everything.

Let’s say, you’ve got a giant industrial machine. It’s some highly specialized piece of process equipment that is a major component of your production line. Now, to the original manufacturer that was a hand-made, mission-specific, one-of-a-kind piece. They spent years developing it, and it took a team of forty people two months to assemble. It had to be shipped in pieces, and a team of half a dozen highly trained techs had to fly out to meet the delivery trucks and spend a week putting all the modules together on-site. At the end of the day, the bill comes in the mail, the bottom line says: Total Cost $12,000,000. 

Fifteen years later, that machine has been operating for 130,000 hours, assuming a little downtime for maintenance. It’s as worn out as a Catholic vagina. Originally, a priesthood of supernerds were flying out to do repairs and maintenance. After 8 years of that, the bean counters started to piss and moan so much about the cost that the service contract was allowed to expire. By then, the in-house techs had a pretty solid idea of how things worked, so they took over maintenance. They didn’t have all the secret manuals or access to just the right parts, but they made do.

Then it got old enough to start being in line for replacement, and maintenance pretty much halted altogether. By this point, it’s held together with Thoughts and Prayers, and the only reason it still functions at all is like a horny Nun - out of habit.

So, their bean counters, who have never set foot on the shop floor and couldn’t actually find the machine if you parked it on their left nut, say that according to their depreciation tables it’s now worth precisely fuckall. They’ve got justification to get a shiny new one, but these guys will look at a dead crack-whore and think “she’s still warm enough for one more go fellas!” So, they get it appraised.

The appraiser (which is the German word for “Bullshit Artist who had too much of a soul to go into sales”) shakes his magic 8-Ball, smacks a stained Ouija board on his abacus, and reads the bones of a roadkill raccoon in the bottom of his morning coffee cup until he has a Grand Mal seizure. When he wakes up, with the drool foam puddled under his face laying on the 220 grit, grey commercial carpet of his office in the fecal position, the voices in his head that know the price of everything and the value of nothing tell him it’s worth $1.48 Million on the surplus market.

So, they list it at auction. After three rounds it fails to meet the minimum bid of $500k. Because the only three other companies on Earth that could actually use the machine either already have a better one of their own, or they’re so far away that the shipping for something the size of a school bus isn’t worth it.

That’s when the bean counters call a local nonprofit. Now, we don’t give a shit about the machine itself or what it is, to us, it’s a pile of parts. But, we like parts, and parts are expensive. So we say “Fuck yeah!” and tell them where to drop it off. Hell, if they’re close we send our own team out to dismantle it for them and spend a week hauling it back to our shop in pieces. All at our own cost, of course. The company could easily donate to help support our expenses in all this, but they don’t because they just gave us a “twelve-million-dollar custom machine!”

So we haul the whole damn thing, in thousands of pieces, back to our shop. It has to go in an isolated room to be quarantined while we sort through the parts and inventory the whole damn pile. Every piece has to be itemized, and a rational “fair market” value has to be established. Often this is done by a few assholes with a laptop looking up each part on eBay for the “previously sold” listings.

Pages, countless pages of inventory are generated for the donation. Every power supply, switch, control panel, actuator, servo - the whole damn thing. Every single part that we can identify and get a price for is catalogued. The process is exhausting, tedious, and a monumental waste of fucking time. At the end of it we now have a whole file folder of meticulously created values and supporting documents, a whole file folder that nobody will ever read.

The machine is now sorted into various piles. Anything that’s useful goes into our supply inventory. Anything that’s good, useful to someone, but we can’t see any application for in the next calendar year, is sold as surplus so we can get fundraising out of it. All of the rest, anything that we can’t use ourselves or sell to someone who can, that’s scrap metal.

Almost nothing goes in the dumpster, not because of some warm and fuzzy environmental reasons, but because dumpsters are expensive. Why pay $300 for a dumpster when you can get pennies on the pound for scrap?

To the scrap man, the bits of the machine that were leftover from us? $5100.

The detailed, itemized paperwork we generated of all the parts? That came out to $147,218.

So… what was the machine actually worth? The donor is going to get a million and a half in tax write-offs because their appraiser said it’s worth $1.48 Million. We don’t get to determine that value, the donor’s appraiser does. In the real world, we might get enough out of it to cover the light bill this month - if we’re lucky.

As icing on the cake, the donor’s PR team gets to talk about the “multi-million-dollar donation of custom equipment to a local non-profit”. In actuality, we worked our asses off cleaning out a piece of their trash, so that we could immediately turn around and hand what little we could get squeezing blood from that stone over to the giant, local power monopoly so that they didn’t turn our shit off for one more month.

This is the glamorous life of working in the nonprofit world.

After many hours of this, we were all at that stage of mentally exhausted where you just get a little loopy and stupid. Given that we had ready access to high voltage and power tools it really was just a matter of time before something stupid happened. Moments like this are why nights at the shop are storied and entertaining. It’s what often made those nights worthwhile.

On this particular occasion, I was ass-deep in a pile of antique PLC devices, sorting them by model number. Mikey was sorting an old wooden crate filled with bearings and pillow blocks. Sean turned to him and recited the ancient incantation that has been used to summon the mischief demon into labs and workshops the world over since times immemorial:

“Dude! Wanna see something cool?”

At that moment, every head in the room prairie-dogged and turned to see exactly what manner of stupid was about to take place.

Sean grabbed one of the hundreds of new-old-stock bearings from the pile, opened the box, and dropped the wax paper wrapper on the floor as he jauntily marched over to the retractable hose reel on the wall with the look of chuffed self-assurance of someone who knows something awesome that you don’t. 

He held the inner race pinched wide in his fingertips and pointed the air gun at the bearings. With a pull of the trigger, the bearing screamed like a turbine engine spooling up. The outer race was spinning at fractional Mach when he opened his fingers and let it drop.

The moment it hit the floor it showered sparks out its ass like a drunken frat boy on the fourth of July and quickly took off towards the nearest wall. It started slowly but built speed exponentially as it balanced out its own friction and inertia of the smooth steel casing against the epoxied floor of the shop. It was a magnificent demonstration of basic physics known to anyone who has worked in a shop for a few years where bearings and compressed air are common.

Mikey thought this was the greatest thing since tits and explosions; he had to try it for himself. He ran across the room, picked up the two-inch bearing from where it had come to rest behind a fire extinguisher by the door, and ran back to where Sean and I were standing already holding out his hand for the air gun.

“I wanna try!” he said as he bounced on the balls of his feet with the gleeful joy of an idiot who has no idea he’s about to nearly die.

I was standing on the wrong side to see it, but Sean took a couple steps back. Without even being conscious of it, I followed suit. Mikey, who apparently didn’t understand how a fucking wheel works, was holding the air gun to the bottom of the bearing instead of the top. He didn’t realize he was spinning it up in reverse.

It was easily spinning over ten-thousand RPM when it hit the floor...

I wish I could say that he was dumb, but lucky, and that it shot between his feet, scared the hell out of us all, and ended up on the wrong side of the room.

But, his shoe was in the way. The only thing that saved his life was that he was wearing big, chunky leather boots.

The unguided gyroscopic death wheel hit the floor and bounced, shooting yellow sparks out a few feet ahead of us, and then immediately proceeded to climb up his left foot.

It was at that moment that Mikey realized, he fucked up.

By nothing short of an actual, tangible, miracle of God almighty, the bearing somehow didn’t touch his baggy jeans or his untucked shirt and missed his head by a cunthair as it launched up, just inches over his shoulder.

That’s when the yelling started.

“You FUCKING RETARD!” I said with the gentle, caring, paternal nature of the shop elder as I walked over to get a new bearing. By now, the old one was lost somewhere back in the supply warehouse.

I grabbed a box at random from the pile and opened the shiny new bearing, about two-inches in diameter with an open face like the last one. I picked up the air gun off the floor and gave a simple demonstration to Mikey on how to hold the nozzle at the proper angle and aim it at the balls, not the races. I also showed him how changing the airstream from the top or bottom changes the direction of rotation. We heard the bearing spin up, slow down, reverse, and back several times. We were all having fun with the sounds it made.

“Now watch this, and realize how close you just came to killing yourself by putting that fucking thing in reverse,” I said, as I walked across the room and pushed the open button on the fourteen-foot high overhead door at the back of the shop.

We were about forty-feet inside the shop, behind the high-voltage cage where the giant Tesla Coil slept silently. We faced the door, and I spun up the bearing with the poise and confidence of someone who had done this since his dad taught him the stupid trick decades before.

I pulled the trigger, spun the bearing up to as fast as I dared hold it in my hand, and dropped it.

Interia held it for the first bounce, and with a couple sparks the second one bit enough to get it moving. By the time it was across the room, it was heading through the door at well over a hundred miles an hour.

Oh, FUCK.

The fourth rule of shooting safety is to, “know your target and beyond.” It so happens, that rule applies to bearing racing too.

With a streak of sparks it shot into the night, across the parking lot, and vanished. We couldn’t see where it ended up, but we certainly *heard* it - large, plate-glass windows make a very distinctive sound when they shatter.

The difference between being a child and a grownup is that when you’re an adult and you do something stupid, you run ***towards*** the sound of the breaking glass.

It had blasted through the front window of the autobody and detailing shop across the street. The window was about six feet square, and the entire upper third of it was pulverized, lying in pieces on the floor inside. The bearing was nowhere to be found.

It was well after ten o’clock, our lab and the auto shop were the only two businesses on the edge of a residential neighborhood and there were houses everywhere. Someone had to have heard that, or we probably set off their alarm system. We knew the cops would be arriving presently. So we all stood around with our thumb up our ass for a full fifteen minutes in weather where the air hurts your face, and none of us had grabbed a fucking coat on our way out.

“Fuck this bullshit, nobody’s coming,” Sean said, and started back across the street to the lab.

“Well we’ve got to do something, we can’t just leave it like that,” I said, jogging to catch up with Mikey on my heels.

We got inside and all found our coats. Moments later we were scrounging through the supply room looking for something to patch up the window. We had steel sheetmetal, but it was way too long and we didn’t want to cut it down for this. So we settled on a large sheet of Lexan that had spent its former life as the front panel safety guard on a labelling machine in a smoked sausage factory. It was a quarter-inch thick and about five feet square, with a shrug of “it’ll do!” we proudly marched it out of the supply room and back into the main workshop.

I sent Mikey off to the tool room to get a roll of aluminum tape, and we all met up back across the street - now properly dressed for the weather. There wasn’t a cop to be found.

With the grace, poise, and silence of a confused rhinoceros trying to rage-fuck a Volkswagon to a crygasm, our elite team of specialists worked diligently into the night. It took another trip back across the street to find some landscaping plastic for the top edge, but we made it alright and while it looked like a hickey on a hemorrhoid, it would at least keep the heat in and any particularly unmotivated thieves out until the morning.

We left a note taped to the inside of the window with a brief explanation, admission of guilt, and my phone number before we all headed off, exhausted and hungry. After a few minutes to have a cigarette and bullshit about the lessons learned that day, we all headed home.

The owner of the shop called me shortly after six-thirty the next morning. I was almost awake enough to remember that six-thirty happens twice in a day. I was unhappy about this fact, but he was far more unhappy about his window and had the advantage of being conscious enough to form complete sentences, though only ones made entirely of capital letters.

I explained that I would be calling the glass repair place the moment they opened and would, of course, cover all expenses. That placated him, and I went back to sleep.

By ten-thirty that morning I was standing in fresh snow outside of his shop and enjoying the show as the two guys from the glass company lifted the nice, new piece of glass from their weird looking truck into place on the front of his office. The autobody shop owner and I spent fifteen minutes talking about the odds, and how often it must happen, that a rock or something gets kicked up by a tire and breaks a new piece of glass because they drive down the road with the panels hanging on the outside of the truck. At no point in any of this conjecture did we actually bother to ask the guy that drives the damn truck, and I’ve gone twenty years since this happened and never gotten the answer.

In the end, I paid $450 for a new window, and Mikey got a lesson in physics, safety, and responsibility. The neighbor was happy, we all had a good laugh about it, and we all went back to finishing up the inventory for that giant donation.

The bearing was found that morning. It was still travelling with enough energy when it hit the back wall of his office to put a sizable dent in the front of his steel filing cabinet. He kept it, and it has sat on the desk in his office ever since. It’s a paperweight with a good story.",2020-07-01 18:47:41

Got my do-nothing coworker from hell fired!,202,h9aib0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/h9aib0/got_my_donothing_coworker_from_hell_fired/,23,1592202234.0,"I work in maintenance for a specialized industry at a major airport. Units that service airplanes, not the planes themselves.

We had this new hire, I'll call her Donna. I did not train Donna, but she requested additional training with me so she could get more hands-on experience wrenching. I tried working with her for 1 day and she argued with me. Said she couldn't work with me anymore. I was kind of astonished, I'm trying to tell her the right way to do things and she was raising her voice and arguing with me. Needless to stay she was stuck doing quality assurance checks for the year or so she was employed. New hires could do more than Donna in under a month.

Our base has a large fleet so one of us was always assigned to help Donna finish up all the mickey mouse inspections and easy stuff. I'm nearest shift to Donna, so, well, fuck.  Now I wouldn't be down on someone for being less capable than me - so long as they are doing an honest job. Problem is Donna never did any of the inspections. She would check off 80% of the items for every unit and leave the hard part for me to finish. Which very quickly led to me realizing that she definitely wasn't checking ANY of the stuff she was signing off on. Daily instances where something is clearly wrong but Donna checked it all off as OK. Like a unit that wouldn't start and hadn't been used all day, but she checked it off. Which then becomes my problem to remedy because she ignored it.

My boss likes to post spreadsheets showing the most inspections/preventative maintenance done and Donna was always 2x above the rest of us on inspections with 0 items fixed/closed. Even an accountant that never left the corporate office knew ""Donna must be full of shit because she finishes inspections faster than anyone and never finds anything wrong."" Policy changed because everyone was sick of Donna making it look like she did the majority of the work while not actually doing any work by checking off all the easy items on every inspection. Yay, small victory. Now we have to finish inspections that we start. She still wasn't doing her job, and it still bothered me. My co-workers kept telling me to leave it be, it's her name signing those documents and it'll be a federal crime if she's caught. (Endangering passengers through negligence, all that.)

Donna was a funny old woman. She liked to boss operators around, and started wearing a supervisor safety vest even though she wasn't a supervisor or a manager. That went on for weeks until one day I jokingly told my boss that a new hire actually thought she was the AM maintenance supervisor. She was back to a normal safety vest the next day, haha. For a while Donna came to work wearing nail extensions which was hilarious because there's no way to wear the safety gloves necessary for handling hazardous materials, so you know she isn't taking any of the samples she is signing off on every day.

Donna liked to call people. A LOT. Not just me, everyone and constantly! Always nonsense like:

**Donna:** ""Hey just letting you know, an operator said this equipment wasn't starting so just letting you know if you wanna have a look at it or something.""

**Me:** ""But did YOU look at it.""

**Donna:** ""Oh it's just a low battery the operator said so. I'm just letting you know in case you wanted to look at it before I report it to the mechanics. ""

**Me:** ""But did you look at it. Why are you asking me to look at the unit for you? Are you really going to write something up without looking at the unit first?""

**Donna:** ""Oh I just thought you might want to look at first because you know so much more than me. It's just a low battery, I'll call Manny.""

**Me:** ""Well I sure hope you are right about the battery then.""

She called me back later asking how to check the battery voltage. Classic. Another one of those 'jesus christ how does she not KNOW this' Donna moments. I found her with a voltmeter out, looking ready to probe both the battery terminals and electrocute herself *I guess.* We all have Donna stories like that. There are just too many to count. This post is getting a bit long so I'll follow up with a part 2 provided there's any interest. Many more Donna moments leading to her eventual firing.",2020-06-15 09:23:54
We don’t work around your schedule! (Service Advisor),46,h79f7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/h79f7s/we_dont_work_around_your_schedule_service_advisor/,4,1591918854.0,"New service advisor, have worked in a shop for a while.

The funniest thing is when customers tell us they have something to do that day and demand their car back within 2 hours of drop off. These customers usually have a few services they want to get done all at once and most of them fall into the category of “I waited super long to get everything done, so get it done *now*”.

I never promise an out time, only because most of our jobs reveal bigger problems. I always let our customers know that it’s recommended we hold it for the entire business day and I will update them if it’s ready any time before - which I’m generally good at.

When talking to a customer about making an appointment, whether it’s a phone call or through our website, I always talk it through with them and ask if they have any prior engagements and let them know we may not be able to get it out by the time of any other activities they have planned.

If we are on a time crunch, we let the technicians know right away and they generally bump it up to try to get it done quickly, when possible. As a small shop, and a good one at that, we work well with our customers and their schedules and most of them are understanding about not getting it back right away.

Anyways, this one customer yesterday was hilarious: they thought they were the “only” one on the schedule, of course.

They brought their car in around 3 pm, when we close at 6. All of the techs are in the middle of laborious jobs that they probably won’t get done till closer to end of day.

The customer says they had an appointment and they did. But they had wanted to come in earlier when we open at 7:30.

They didn’t show and every other one of our 6 appointments showed up and we’re down to the last 4, ready to push them out.

Somehow, our master tech steps away from his other job (which unfortunately had to get pushed to the next night, luckily the customer was okay with it), and powers through the oil change.

The customer continues to creep around the edge of our shop, watching us to make sure we’re actually working. I could see him from my window and he would call anytime they didn’t see the tech in his bay.

Eventually, the customer became hungry and called me for any spare food. We have some candy, but they declined since they don’t like sweets. I recommended the bar that just opened post-Covid restrictions. They stated they don’t like bar food.

It’s now 5:45. The tech is just finishing their notes after a test drive. Perfect. On time. The tech hands me the notes and I go over them, call the customer, let them know everything and the customer immediately berates me with questions:

I tell them the drive belts have some normal wear and tear, nothing severe and not in need of replacing.

They say: *”How could you not know which belts to replace?”*

I’m confused by this so I respond by saying they’re just called the drive belts and there are specific belt names, but I was just told it was the drive belts.

They say: *”Well <dealership> would be more specific. I guess I’ll just take it to them.”*

I say okay. Proceed with the notes. Mention they’re due for a brake inspection at their next LOF or after.

*”Why can’t we just do it now? Why not tackle the problem now?”*

I say because the tech isn’t noting any problems - the brakes were in fairly good condition according to their inspection and wasn’t due for a major overhaul.

*”I guess I’ll wait. I hope my brakes don’t die because of you.”*

I say okay. Mind you, the guy is on the phone outside and can see me and I can see him. He’s very agitated, I’m unbothered.

Finally, the customer gives me a “suggestion”: *”Hey I understand I was late, but when you called me to tell me you checked my car in, I was under the impression it was close to finishing. It was odd to me that it would be done when I JUST dropped off, but maybe I misunderstood that. Could you be better about telling me when my car is done?”*

I let him know: “(Customer), I did tell you that we may not finish today because you didn’t come in earlier when you said you would. We do have other cars to work on and we can’t wait on one car that comes close to closing. Our tech stepped off another job that he was going to finish tonight to make sure you got yours quickly. We don’t work around your schedule if you don’t tell us before hand.”

The customer is exasperated, but tries to say they understand. They say that the dealership would be better.

I tell him “That’s totally fair to say. We’re a small shop and we don’t have as many techs or bays as a dealership. I get that. If you prefer their services, then please bring it to them instead. Goodbye and have a good one.”

Gave him his keys and bill and we closed shop. He spent the next ten minutes trying to back out of the parking spot (it was an open parking spot on the side of the building) and got easily frustrated.

Anyways, long story short: Customer got mad that he brought his car in so late and we just barely finished on time (HIS time) and was mad at me for not communicating specific information when I clearly did.",2020-06-12 02:40:54
So My weekly post. I am a hunter/trapper for invasive/dangerous animals in rural Florida and this is a recent story from my job.,77,gwy4jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/gwy4jr/so_my_weekly_post_i_am_a_huntertrapper_for/,14,1591333053.0,"&#x200B;

So recently I had a client who had a few problems on there property. One with A Nile monitor eating there chickens,Feral hogs trying to eat there cat,Peacocks crapping on there car which is all normal parts of my job

But they also had Wild cattle on the property but i was not hired to handle them so i did not really expect any problems so i walk along the property looking for tracks and near by i heard a loud mooing sound from deep in the palmetto bushes([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenoa)). so i really don't expect a problem and i continue on my search for razor back tracks and i hear again a loud mooing sound and a loud rustle of palmetto bushes. And then out of the huge palmettos comes out a giant angry wild bull coming straight towards me.

So i run in the opposite direction and try to loose it in the palmetto bushes which does not work and its still angry as all hell and right behind me trying to kill me so i see a sand pine tree ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus\_clausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_clausa)) which unlike the picture of this Wikipedia link will show you are mostly straight trees and so was this one but luckily mostly all sand pine trees are short and i was able to jump up and climb and get up and way from this pissed off angry wild bull.

This animal had something wrong with it because it did not leave after seeing me climb up a tree it just circled the tree and so i waited a few hours and this thing did not leave. And so i really had no choice this animal was being highly aggressive to human actively trying to kill a person and so I took my Winchester model 70 chambered in 308 off of my shoulder and shot the animal. but it did not flinch and it did not care it charged the tree trying to knock it over and i shot the animal again this time in the head yet again it did not even show pain it just circled the tree no mooing,no charging the tree this time it wanted me dead.

And i got really scared shit less. i have seen feral water buffalo die from a single shot to the head from a 308 round,i have seen a man eating gator die from a single 308 round. And this felt like a horror movie. so i unloaded the rest of the 3 last shots in my rifles magazine and it felt like noting was working until the last round which the animal fell dead from. after this i told the property owner what happened And they gave me some grief at first but then payed me some extra money for that job.

But i will never forget that bull.

Well recently i posted the list of animals that are invasive or might be invasive in florida heres a link  [https://www.reddit.com/r/invasivespecies/comments/gyilkr/so\_my\_job\_is\_huntingtrapping\_invasive\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/invasivespecies/comments/gyilkr/so_my_job_is_huntingtrapping_invasive_and/)",2020-06-05 07:57:33
funny and frustrating stories from work,31,gur5sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/gur5sz/funny_and_frustrating_stories_from_work/,0,1591039714.0,"context: I worked at a hospital in food service for 3 years after my mental health was nearly scrambled. And these are only a few of the stories that I found funny and the most frustrating. the cast hospital employee: HE, Me: me/op, co-worker: cw, boss: bs  


1: I was taking out the trash with a co-worker and when I emptied out my trash can I saw a bunch of gross bin water. She told me to use the hose on the wall next to us. Now, this was like a gardening hose but confusing, I turned on the faucet and tried to spray the water in the bin. I ended up spraying myself in the face.  


2: I was cleaning the cafe with another co-worker, we have an unsaid rule that 10 minutes after we close you can still grab some food but not from the grill, once those 10 minutes are up we're close. I was cleaning the salad bar while my co-worker was cleaning the hotline when we got a knock.  


me: \*opens the door\* can I-  
he: hi! I know your closed and I'm sorry but can I have some fries?  
(we were past our 10 minute mark)  
me: sorry but we just threw our fries out and the fryer is turned off.  
he: please? I'm hungry!  
(our hospital was just 5 minutes drive away from a deli)  
me: sorry miss, once we're close, we're closed  
(15 minutes pass and I walk back into the cafe)  
bs: op, did you deny he some fries?  
me: \*confused and looks in the cafe\*  
he: \*walking out the cafe with a basket of fries\*  
me: \*thinking to myself\* (jfc I just want to quit, I wanted to go to college but no my parents forced me to get this godforsaken job)  
me: yeah  


my boss then proceeds to lecture me on how I need to work on customer satisfaction.  
me: \*thinking again\* bitch all you do is stay in your office all day and only come out to get some food.  
my boss leaves  
cw: yeah, he came back to tattle  
me:... \*dial up sounds in my head\* all because she didn't get any fries?",2020-06-01 22:28:34

Everyone has a complaint,27,grw97z,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/grw97z/everyone_has_a_complaint/,1,1590627312.0,"So for context, I work at a pet store that had a grooming salon. For several weeks we were closed due to quarantine but last Friday we opened up. We had a wait list for grooming and called as many people as possible on that list. 

Here are 3 short complaints people had 

So this happened yesterday, May 21st. I was working alone that day. Now my boss doesn’t really enforce the mask rule. If it’s just one person getting something quick, I don’t mind. So a woman came in and apologized, saying she left her mask at home and just needed like 2 small things. It was just me in the building and I had my mask so I didn’t care. She was very nice brow. Then an older woman (W) comes in and says to the lady as in ringing her up 

W: you should be wearing a mask. 

So I didn’t pay much mind and the woman walked away. The nice lady left and W came back 

W: you know, it’s the law that people wear mask. You need to enforce it

First off, it’s not. And my boss doesn’t strongly enforce it. I wear mine. He never wears one. 

So she went on for another 15 minutes how the woman is bad and she’ll get me fired for not wearing a mask. Now I’m a quiet person so I just stood there. Finally she got her things and left.

So the second event is pretty short but annoying. An old guy (G) walks in and says 

G: you don’t carry Purina right?

Me: no we don’t 

G: you got anything similar and cheap?

So I start showing him Foods that are on the cheaper scale. The entire time he keeps complaining  that we don’t have Purina and that’s all his dogs will eat. Then why did you come here??

Last one really just irked me. A woman, I’ll call Karen (K) called me to make a grooming appt and this is how it went.

K: hi I would like to make an appointment for my dog.

Me: sure. *starts to get the grooming book out, open to the next available date*

K: do you have anything next Friday

Now I already how we’re booked for like the next three weeks. We can’t squeeze anyone else in.

Me: no sorry were booked up this week. So because-

K: *cutting me off* how about that Thursday?

Me: we don’t do grooming on thursdays

K: how about the week after 

Me: no sorry, so because we had to close for several weeks, we had to cancel a bunch of people. So when we reopened we had to call all those people back first. And we filled up pretty quickly. The next available  appt I can give you is June 5th. 

This is the basic speech my boss told me to tell people. Most people are understanding.

K: *deep sigh*  I am very disappointed.

Honestly, I don’t care. Why should I? I don’t know you.

K: you know, I’ve been going to that store for many years. 

And? You know how many people try to use that line to get what they want? I don’t care how long you’ve come here, it doesn’t change reality. 

Me: ma’am I am sorry but that is the soonest appointment I can do. If you want to book it, I can make a note to call you if we get anything sooner. 

K: no, I need him done now. He’s a mess

So are all the other dogs? What makes you special

Me: I understand ma’am but-

K: why didn’t anyone call me and let me know you were open?!

Now she’s raising her voice. It’s not our job to. 

K: I am very upset. Have the groomer or the owner call me tomorrow.

Me: okay ma’am I will.

After I take her info she hangs up. I text my boss about it and he jokes around that he’ll tell her the next appt is now September and that she should’ve accepted my offer lol. 


The groomer did call her and she was fine with that date. So idek.


TL/DR: woman complains about lack of mask, man complains about food he knows we don’t carry then woman uses the “I’m a loyal customer” card to get what she wants",2020-05-28 03:55:12
Howdy this is a weekly post about what happens at my job.,54,grq1mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/grq1mm/howdy_this_is_a_weekly_post_about_what_happens_at/,23,1590606364.0,"My job is hunting and trapping invasive and dangerous animals in Rural Florida privately I normally hunt pythons,tegu lizards,nile monitors,peacocks and a bunch more. I get hired by ranches,property owners and large commercial farms. So I can't tell exact names or places of the people who hire me but i can tell what happened to me on the job. 

So i can tell a story that happened about not to long ago. So in Central Florida i was hired by a hobby farm owner that has more open land for wildlife then farm And the property owner told me that there was something Killing and eating there pigs recently but ,adult sheep,goats and mini horses not to long ago. So I look at the pig pen and I see whats left of a few pigs mangled and very little left of the animals. And i get into the pen and i take a look at the ground and see Many paw prints that came from some sort of canine. I ask the property owner what lives in the area and they say only that they know of deer,gators,feral hogs,coyotes and other small critters. I ask about the coyotes. And they told me that the property owner hears them howling and barking every night and they cause a bunch of noise and there's normally 10 or 17 during the years they have lived on the property and they go after deer,hogs and this is not the first time they have gone after there live stock. Well this is confusing because coyotes don't normally hunt in packs they are primary solitary animals going after smaller prey like small mammals,insects and small reptiles and rarely one in a blue moon they would go after deer. And if they were going after domestic animals they would be more willing and able to kill small dogs,cats,chickens and baby animals. Not large pigs so from looking at this i can tell this coyotes when they are in a group in Florida its a recent littler of pups about to be adults but is during the time that coyotes have pups. So I then ask the property owner does a neighbor raise dogs. The property owner responded to this question a few years back a there was an illegal breeding fighting dog ring. And this is a smoking gun rarely dogs and coyotes breed and when that happens the new hybrid animal a coydog is more likely to say together in a pack. So I go out on to the property. I very quickly find evidence of this and lay out traps. I don't like killing dogs or any thing closely related to a dog unless it ate a person so I catch them alive and because I own a very secure large ranch property I allow these animals to live on my own property i have allot of invasive and native animals living on my property like black buck,feral waterbuffalo,axis deer,sambar deer,Barasingha,burros,wild horses,nilgal,gemsbock,drama gazelle,eland and native animals too like bison,white tailed deer, gators and more. But unlike most people who have these animals on a property I have mine secured with a electric fence with a concrete wall that goes about 4 feet down into the ground and I Have the non natives that are endangered sent to zoos for breeding programs. But some times I need a predator that can help me so after I trapped these coydogs i let them onto my property and they have been a help to me ever sense. But i still make sure they have a fear of humans.",2020-05-27 22:06:04

It's midseason ofc it will take some time!,24,gm0roq,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/gm0roq/its_midseason_ofc_it_will_take_some_time/,2,1589805881.0,"So In my city, we do not get many outsiders but it does happen (By outsiders I mean, not Czechs). I work for my dad in a tire shop and help around. When someone comes that cant speaks Czech there is usually no problem because I can talk to them in English and all is well. Everyone understands no matter if there is a language barrier that having a full set of tires and changing them will take time, especially when it is midseason.

Now incomes an older man who tries to speak Czech but miserably fails and cannot speak English. Our receptionist after a long time of decoding finds out that he needs his tire fixed. No problem she tells him that since he doesn't need his tires changed and fixing tires isn't as much as a priority for us as changing tires that he will need to wait since there were other customers before him and the workers are very busy rn. So about 10min pass by and no one got to his tire yet. 10min isn't a very long time and if you want your tire fixed during the season you will wait up to an hour since all the workers are very busy. This man starts to peek into the workshop where his tire was put and doesn't seem very happy. Now my boss (My dad) allows the customers to walk into the workshop but the other workers don't like that since the customers are usually in the way and make it a pain for everyone. This man now takes it upon himself to stand in the main doorway of the workshop and stare at us and the tire probably implying that he wants his tire done. I come up to him and ask if he needs some help with anything and if he could be so kind to go back into the seating area where the tv is, so he could make space for us and the wheels. Instead of just waiting he starts to ask me about when his tire will be done and why is no one working on it. While he's talking in a raised voice he throws his hands around and seems pretty displeased. I explain to him that we are in midseason and there are people with cars and wheels that need changing and once a worker will find time to work on it he will right away. Now fixing a tire doesn't take that much time on its own. Its the problem with finding a 10-15min window where you have time and the concentration to fix it. We weren't making this guy wait around for no reason. About another 10min pass by after he sits back down and he starts to shout things in his native language I presume. Not only does he start shouting around other customers but he also periodically slams the table in the waiting room. When I walk in the room to see who is doing all this ruckus. He looks at me and starts walking towards me. I who can put one and one together can already feel that this will not be a pleasant conversation. He puts his hand on my shoulder and starts saying something in his language. He uncomfortably close to me at this point too and I don't really know what to do. He was speaking in some other Slavic language, I only understood that he doesn't have time and to speed up. He lets me go and I go back to the workshop where the tier is and tell one of my co-workers that the guy who wants his tire fixed wants it right now. My co-worker looks at me and asks if he has been complaining and if it was him making so much noise? I tell him that most likely was him and that he was complaining to me. My co-worker seeming pissed repairs the tire and walks out. I follow him as he looks at the guy yells at him to get up and that he has the bill for him. The guy seemed surprised but still annoyed and started to say something in his language again. Co-worker stands next to him while he pays and seems to be complaining to him and our receptionist. The only thing that my co-worker is doing is sarcastically agreeing and once the guy paid he hands him the tire and says that he hopes he will never see him again.",2020-05-18 15:44:41
"I don't care if you're not qualified, JUST DO IT!",59,glm464,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/glm464/i_dont_care_if_youre_not_qualified_just_do_it/,4,1589745346.0," Ik I posted this on r/TalesFromRetail but it was removed because it wasn't retail, so I'm posting here.  

This happened about a year and a half ago.

Background info: I help out at my dad's tire service and I have 10h shifts so you can imagine how tired I am. This happened during the spring season so there is non-stop running around for me since my job is to get the tires to the work stations and then back to the car. I don't do any of the more difficult things like removing the tire from the rims or balancing them.

The story goes as follows: A white BMW drives in and you can already tell its some jack ass due to my city not being the nicest. A guy with a snapback and a tracksuit comes out of it and seems to wait patiently in line, so no problem right? When his turn comes and drives into the outside garage my co-worker (Also my only friend there and the guy I work with the most) goes and starts taking off the tires. The whole time this guy keeps on reminding him to be careful and not to scratch his car or the rims (This piss is of the co-worker because he can't concentrate on the work). Then when I come in to roll the tires to the work station he reminds me too about 50x.

The best part comes when my co-worker is needed with my dad so I'm left to roll the tires there and be with this guy alone. While I'm placing the wheels on their specific side and spots and start leaving this guy yells at me ""Where are you going? Aren't you gonna put on my wheels?"" I tell him that I'm their just to assist and help with small tasks and I'm not qualified to do what he asks of me. This doesn't sit well with him. He continues about how I'm supposed to do my job and put on his wheels. Now to put in perspective, I'm 15 at the time and I'm not really strong, like at all. He has BMW tires with steel rims. They are really fucking heavy. I wouldn't have the strength to lift those and make them precisely fit. So I tell him this. Instead of accepting that, I can't do what he requests. So he comes up to me yanks me towards his car and tells me ""Do your fucking job, I have places to be!"" Now I am kinda scared because if I attempt to put on the wheels and damage the rims, the tire or the fucking car I'll be in a lot of trouble and the business could get sued. Also being a short 15-year-old and getting yelled at by a complete stranger isn't the most pleasant thing either. So I stand next to the car not really knowing what to do.

Thank fucking god my co-worker comes in!

You can't believe how much relief came over me. He says he heard yelling and came over to find out what was happening. The guy started to complain about how I'm not doing my job and that he again has places to be. My co-worker looks at me with a petrified face and looks back at the guy. My co-worker proceeds to the guy that he must be crazy thinking a kid like me could do what he asks for and that he must be really fucking stupid. This doesn't sit well with the guy and he starts to complain about how he has been treated. My co-worker ignores him and puts his wheels on and tells him his bill is waiting at the desk. I swiftly walk back to the stations to relax a bit since my anxiety is screaming at this moment.

I haven't heard if he continued to complain or if there was any more trouble after that. My co-worker after that just came in to check if I was ok.",2020-05-17 22:55:46

Also If theres a better place to post this let me know

Also this is my first post so forgive me for not being a good story teller yet 

This happened years ago when I was fresh off an unpaid internship and went to work at an ice cream shop my friend managed for a little. I figured it’d be a nice change of pace from my stressful internship and I’d be able to put assistant manager on my resume. A little background: the manager and I worked there together in high school so the owner knows and loves us. There are 3 scoops of ice cream in a milkshake. Different ice creams are softer than other, vanilla is usually a pretty soft ice cream. Also it was a chain ice cream shop so there’s a corporate line. 

Okay cast is small: me- me, Em- entitled mom, m-manager


So I’m working alone one weekday morning and we’re pretty slow. A woman walks in with her two kids (middle school and possibly a freshman in high school age) and order a double scoop of ice cream and a medium vanilla shake for her kids.

I start with the double scoop and the first kid takes it and takes a couple bites. 

I go to make the milkshake and since we were slow and i was in a good mood I decided to throw in a 4th huge scoop and less Milk to try to make the milkshake thicker for her. 

I finish and place the milkshake on the counter in front of the register and start ringing her up

Em looks at the shake but doesn’t touch it (this will be important later)

Em- um can you add more ice cream to this? It’s runny

Me, caught off guard a lil- oh um here see 

I then picked up the milkshake and tilted it so she could see it was barely moving. Honestly is was as good as you could get with how soft the vanilla was unless she wanted pure ice cream no milk. 

Me- I put in an extra scoop to make sure it would be thicker for you 

Em- no I need another scoop in there that’s watery 

Me- okay I can add an extra scoop but I’ll have to charge you

Em as you can guess starts losing her shit

I stay “calm” because I shut down when being yelled at. 

Me- I’m sorry ma’am but I already put in an extra scoop, making it the amount that goes into a large, so it would be thicker for you. If I add any more I need to charge you

Em continues losing her shit and says she won’t pay for the shake and doesn’t want it 

I ring her up for the double scoop and as soon as I finish she continues yelling at me

Me- ma’am I’m going to have to ask you to please leave our store

Em- YOU ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON YOU SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO INTERACT WITH OTHERS IM GOING TO GET YOU FIRED

Me, knowing the manager and owner have my back- okay ma’am have a nice day. 

She then goes outside and tries to take pictures of me. When I move so I’m blocked she screams THATS RIGHT HIDE

I then go in the back to do some deep breathing and let M and the owner know what happened. 

Cut to the next day

We got an email from corporate. Em claimed I screamed at her to “GET OUT” and did nothing but yell at her after she tasted the milkshake and it tasted like pure milk no ice cream....

But wait a second... she never touched the milkshake... how would she know what it tastes like....

As soon as I told M she didn’t even touch the shake he got a big grin on his face and quickly pulled up the security cameras to my interaction with her. Since we have cameras at every angle (who knows why lol) you can see 1. Her waving her arms in anger and visibly upset 2. Me sitting there calmly just taking it all then politely asking her to leave and 3. She never touch let alone tasted to shake

M quickly types an email “inviting her to the store to discuss the matter further to come to a prompt resolution” and sends it to the email she provided to corporate. 

Email bounces back. Corporate took down her email wrong. I never saw her again. 


My friend was so excited to show her the video and then tell her if she continues to harass the employees she’ll be banned from the store. 

And there you go. Most anti climatic ending ever.",2020-05-08 20:02:07

Being lazy,8,g90blj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/g90blj/being_lazy/,2,1587992736.0,"I have been working in my current IT centered job (+seniority) for more than 15 years, and still I am surprised how many of my colleagues fill their days with meaningless, repetitive tasks that they don't like, just because ""they have to be done"".

&#x200B;

Being lazy, to me any repetitive tasks screams for automation or - at least - efficiency. I like using shell scripts\*1 to extract the values I need from system logfiles, and coupled with a cron job, I get the files I need delivered to my export directory without any manual input. Others spend a few hours hunting for them... (and no, it's not because they'd rather do this than something else).

&#x200B;

Same goes for training schedules (rather complex here, lots of legal and formal requirements) - once I took over (partial) responsibility for staff training, I spent a few days finding ways of importing all the important data points (e.g., which qualification has which prerequisites, which internal or external trainings are required, how many days of on-the-job training, ...) and basically generated a database that nobody else in the 5000+-employee company has - I select the qualification(s) I need to train a new employee for, get a list of all training activities required, can then check the boxes for all the prior knowledge the new employee has and - bam - here is the list of all training activities required, taking into account all dependencies so they can be done in the correct order. To me, it's well worth it - maybe 80 hours of effort and now I can get results instantaneously, whereas everybody else spends 4-5 hours per new employee for the same task. They don't want, don't need or don't understand the reason for my database.

&#x200B;

Still, being lazy means I see it as a great way to rid me of repetitive tasks, and to generate value for my employer at the same time. Therefore, I can spend my working time with more meaningful activities. Overall, my being lazy increases my productivity...

&#x200B;

BUT - as my dear colleagues don't understand my concept of lazyness - is there a different term that describes my mindset better?

There is also no contact allowed between people who were split. Our office is at the street level so anybody can see inside if they try.   
Now our manager, leť call him Tom gathered us to announce that he was told by the leadership that we are required to wear masks even inside our office. Something he made a poll about and everybody refused (him included).  
So he argued that it´s nonsense and that we (in our building) are not going to wear them. He was told that there will be inspection that will enforce this rule. He pointed out that he doesn´t care because nobody from the company is allowed to enter our workplace, so they can´t enforce it aynway.  
The other manager told him the inspection will simply look through the window.   
So in his infinite wisdom he decided that we will keep our shutters closed at all times, so that the inspection can´t see inside and since they can´t enter the building they can´t bother us with masks.

I will hopefully share many of them, but I decided this would be the first one.

One night, after I had just clocked out and the graveyard shift workers arrived, I noticed that the two crew members who were put on happened to be two of the grumpiest, most hot-headed coworkers that I had at the time. So of course, I immediately think to myself ""What wiseacre thought it would be a good idea to put *those two* on the graveyard shift together?! Oh well, glad I don't have to work with them."" So I went into the break room, sat down, and treated myself to an after work snack that I would have before heading home. Well, mere moments later, I hear loud arguing going on. And it wasn't simply bickering. I'm talking screaming, cussing, and threats of violence.

Then suddenly, one of them ran into the break room where I was and began punching the wall repeatedly. I tried to avoid eye contact with him during this time, lest he redirect any of his rage to me, but I was definitely in shock. After he exited the break room and returned to the kitchen, the conflict continued. At this point, I decided it would be best to exit the work area, so I moved from the break room to the lobby, making sure to stay on the complete opposite side of the kitchen from them as I passed through it. When I got to the front desk, the manager on duty at the time asked me if I was okay, and I told him I was, so then he informed me that he had called the cops on the two.

When I went out into the lobby, a customer who had witnessed most of the incident had *also* called the cops. I thanked him before finding a table a safe distance from the kitchen to sit at and finish my food. During the time I was still eating, the cops arrived, but surprisingly by that time, the fight had already dissipated, and the manager had made both of them clock out.

Neither of them got arrested or charged with anything. The only punishment they got at all was being sent home by the manager, and the one who started it got suspended. Most people I tell this story to think they got off way too easy, and I'm honestly inclined to agree with that. What do y'all think?

P.S. Neither of them work there anymore. Thank goodness!",2020-04-14 09:34:21

So I work at a pet store in NY (which has started their shutdown) and pet stores are considered essential. But we also have a grooming salon, which isn’t considered essential.  So they are closed indefinitely.
I also work in a pretty nice area, definitely well off kinda people. The kind of people who spend over $200 normally in the store, and brag that they spend the most amount of money there.


Here’s my tales 

1) a guy came in wearing a mask, got three bags of dog food and then proceeded to stand 10ft away, throw the credit card at me and told me to just ring him up and throw it back A) uh what? B) I need to scan your items. (It was three different kinds so it wasn’t like I could just scan one and add two) took a few minute to explain to him.

2) a woman came in today and wanted to make a grooming appt (Saturday was their last day of operation). I explained to her that they are closed indefinitely and why. She proceeded to scream at me and say “it’s not my dogs fault there’s a virus!” I felt like saying “it ain’t my fault either” but I just had to stand there and keep apologizing to her.

3) idk I’d this counts as corona related, but it happened on Saturday so I’ll tell it. The interaction went like this.

K walks in

Me: hello. How are you?

K: do you have cats here?

Me: we don’t sell cats no, sorry

K: no I mean do you have adoptable cats?!

Me: no I just have the two store cats here, and they aren’t against for adoption

K: you used to!

(We never did)

Me: um I don’t believe so ma’am. We’ve never had adoptable cats here

K: I know the groomer you know 

K proceeded to knock on the grooming salon door and call over the head groomer

K: hello G, I need adoptable cats

Just yesterday I was working my part time job in a salon we only do haircuts so I am sure you can guess which big franchise this is. A family come in and no one is taking our current situation seriously and practicing social distancing because they really need a haircut.  All three boys get signed in for haircuts and lucky me I get the youngest one he is five. He climbs up on the booster seat and I put a Sanex strip around his neck then drape him up. He immediately starts squirming in the chair. Here we go. I tell him “ if you get itchy do not rub your face on the cape because it will only smear more hair on your face”. I reach down and flip the cape back to expose his right hand and say “ if you get itchy take your hand out from under the cape and wipe the hair off your face, ok?” He shakes his head yes and away we go. I get the perimeter of his head cut wth clippers and he is taking away telling me about his dog, the bike ride he just had, how he was getting hotdogs for lunch after the haircut when he scrunches up his face. I stopped cutting his hair and ask what is wrong. He tells me he sucked hair up his nose. Uh oh. 

I casually ask if he can blow air out of his nose to get the hair out But not so hard buggers come out.  I have two sons and know the ways of five year old boys well.  He does as I ask and nope it goes not work. He then casually takes his left hand out from under the cape and jams his index finger up his nose and proceeds to try and give himself a lobotomy.  When he pulls his finger out of his nose he very casually says “wow look how big this bugger is” me having the sence of humor of a 12 year old boy looks at it and says “ it sure is!”   He then again and before I could give him something to wipe his hand  with flicks said bugger in the direction of the station next to me that was occupied.  It was everything I could do not to laugh my ass off.  I casually looked around at to my good fortune no one was paying us any attention.

Me: how can I help?

Customer: can you tell me what this is?

Me: it’s a flex tap connector

Customer: and can you tell me it’s size?

Me: it looks around 300mm

Customer: yeah and it’s too small, I need a 500mm one minimum, will you get me one?

At this point I open our catalogue straight to the page, slide it across the desk, type in the page on the website and then it to face him, both showing we don’t do it.

Today was any other normal day in the office from my perspective doing my work and moving along to more work. Around 4:50 my boss (the cfo) calls me into her office which I assume would be for any number of requests she asks me to do for her, it was not. She uttered that oh so terrible phrase, ""we're going to have to terminate you."" I was entirely confused and shocked when she said that. I am a 24 year old who had been at the company for 2 years and 8 months since I graduated. I thought I was very good at my job. I was always the person who would be on time every day, come in on Saturdays, whenever it was needed, I would take on additional roles and responsibilities whenever asked because I genuinely enjoyed doing it and learning new pieces to really help out because I am a team player. My Boss would always come to me with new stuff to work on and she always applauded my work ethic and my wanting to learn more and do more to become more versatile to the company. Since I had started there in July of 2017 there has not been a single time where I was not doing all of my job responsibilities as well as helping and doing other peoples responsibilities to help the company. I was always working over 40 hours every week staying late and assisting wherever needed to make sure everything got done. The company itself has a significant issue in turnover because it is not regarded as treating employees well and in December 2019, our single accounts payable employee resigned because it was significantly too much volume for a single person. I took over that as well as my job responsibilities on top of that to make sure all the invoices coming in got paid and our vendors were happily receiving their payments as well as juggling massive reconciliations and other responsibilities. We hired a new guy and I've continued to assist him and train him since then. One of my other responsibilities is reviewing the hundreds of checks that get sent into the office by sales reps across the country to make sure they were deposited remotely, or if they were not, to deposit them in house. At this time over the past two months, I was extensively doing two full time jobs while only being the single individual I am and yet today, ended very differently than most. As I said before, I got a call from my boss at 4:50 this afternoon which I thought was going be just be some tedious request to do something for her. Instead, I got terminated, on the spot. The reasoning you might ask? A customer complained that they were put on hold because we had not deposited their check. The check arrived in the office on Thursday of Last week and was in the middle of hundreds of others that needed to be reviewed. The check was written for early February meaning the sales rep also took his jolly time sending it into the office. I received an email this morning regarding the so I went out of my way to make sure the check was deposited today which it was.Then I get called into the office and fired with the sole reasoning because that check was not deposited and the customer complained with no other reasoning. It was absolutely insulting and just downright ridiculous. A previous accountant was terminated before my tenure there began in which he received 3 ""write ups"" (official warnings regarding work performance) and 16k in severance. I received 0 warnings and was terminated on the spot with no severance, just a quick escort out of the door. I had been doing my entire job along with making sure payables are all complete and doing my month end close reconciliation and I am fired because a check took 3 days to be deposited... Since I left and others have heard, over half of the staff has reached out to me saying ""that isn't right"" and that I need to sue the company for wrongful termination because it was absolutely utterly ridiculous. Firing one of the hardest working employees because he did not have time to deposit one check because you had already given him an insurmountable mountain of work? Why not actually hire the correct number of people you need? That just seems significantly more rationale to me especially since the owner gets paid Millions in dividends every year so affording it is not the issue. It was entirely insulting, degrading and angering to have the boss id done everything for and worked my ass off for to make sure the company was great fire me for such a little situation. First, If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading! It felt good just to get this off my chest because I just find it so ridiculously absurd and unfair. Needless to say, its been a pretty awful day reddit and any help would be significantly appreciated whether it be advice, thoughts on the situation or even just a joke to lighten the mood for me!

So this happened today and I needed to write about it

I work at a small pet shop in the nicer neighborhood on Long Island. So rich people. I’m fairly new, working about a month now, but I got the hang of it and I’m very precise to make sure I ring up everything correctly.

And most people that come in are super nice and friendly and despite having an anxiety disorder, it helps when there’s nice approachable people. I’ve dealt with a couple rude customers but none like EP. 

Now this woman had come in once before, had me bag everything separately, and got upset when I didn’t bag exactly how she wanted. Whatever.

So today, she comes in, piling shit on the counter. It was like 250 worth of stuff, including discounts for a case of dog food and bones. So I ring it up, making sure I get everything and take off discounts for her. Meanwhile there’s a line forming behind her. I’m trying to be efficient and get her out. I’m bagging things separately. Now I start putting cans in the bags, and I barely got two in before she says “no more. The bag will break” like okay lady. So I’m bagging like two cans at a time. So the rest of the transaction goes like this

EP: So what’s my invoice?

Me: your invoice?

EP: don’t you guys print out invoices?

Me: I can give you the receipt once you pay 

EP: sure I just wanna make sure you rang everything up


So I ring her card up, got her to sign and gave her the receipt. Now the products aren’t labeled on the receipts, just the numbers but you can see how much everything costs and how many you were charged for. Now because there was so much stuff, I couldn’t remember exactly what order I rang things up. So she proceeds to stand there and look over the receipt. I ring up the next guy, then she turns to me. 

Ep: *pointing to first item* so let’s go over this shall we?

Me: uhh

EP: *goes over every item, asking what each is*

 I tell her to my best knowledge, then she says “no that’s not the right one it’s this one” (she was wrong, I checked)

Ep: *talking really slow* so I know your new so that’s why I’m going over this with you to help you understand what you charged me for

At this point I’m both super pissed of and ready to cry as my anxiety is taking over 

Me: mhm 

I literally put on my biggest bitch smile I could and just stared. Like I was done. There were other people waiting and her she was, demanding and rude. Like I’m 19. I’m not some 15 year old with their first job. Have I messed up once or twice on people’s transaction? yes. But I take care of it immediately. 

If she had a concern, she should’ve just asked, instead of insisting she knew all the prices and talking down to me like I’m a child.",2020-02-22 20:48:51

"Got to work for my dream job, but my supervisor made me wanna quit",70,f5ebh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/f5ebh8/got_to_work_for_my_dream_job_but_my_supervisor/,3,1581968573.0,"  TL;DR at bottom 
I’ve worked in customer service the last few years and I finally found a job that a, I’m interested in and b, pays well. I’d be working at my old middle school, where I’d see some of my favorite teachers. I want to be a middle school science teacher and I’d be working at the after school program doing STEAM activities. I’m currently in college and one of my classes got out half hour after my shift started + the time it takes to get to work (ABOUT 20 min). The director of the program really wanted to work with me and said we could work around it, since it was just 1 day a week and I would come in early and make up the hours.

On my site it was just me (21) and my supervisor (28). I would ask a lot of questions about how to handle situations or tell her what I said to help me grow in my position and she would give constructive criticism, however it quickly became condescending and she would talk to me the way she would talk to the kids. She started complaining about me coming in late, I told her the director said it was fine. She mainly dropped it but would make comments about me being late from time to time, which kinda got under my skin since I was hired with my given availability. 

One morning I woke up with extreme pain in my mouth and got worse throughout the day, I thought I had a bad cavity. Went to the dentist the next day and my wisdom teeth were coming in and pushing all my teeth together and my bottom ones were actually coming through my gums and getting irritated and bloody. I was scheduled for an extraction for all 4 teeth, 2 weeks out since it could’ve started causing infections and my mouth was constantly aching. I told her the surgeon recommended 1 full week of being out for recovery so I would need to take that time off. I requested fri-thu off since my surgery was Friday morning. The next day she approached me upset I took a week off, saying how she only needed 2 days off then went back to work. She also warned me I only have 10 sick days, so I should use them wisely. As if getting teeth pulled from my face isn’t a good reason. But, it had been explained to me multiple times that it is easier to cancel a request for a sub and just go into work than it is to actually get a sub. So I figured it would be better to just come in if I don’t need the extra time? I just explained my surgeon really recommended taking a week off since it’ll be all 4 and I’ll be drugged up and I didn’t wanna strain my mouth. She backed off, reluctantly and I was pretty pissed. 

Monday after my surgery comes around and she texts me around 6p asking how I am. I tell her it’s been the worst day so far but I’m hanging in there, and she responds saying sorry that sucks I didn’t have a sub today or Friday feel free to come in as soon as you can. I was appalled, she texted me to tell me while I’m on sick leave that she had a tough day and needs me to come in. Like, I’m sorry that the system sucks but I’m taking Hydrocodone I cannot drive a vehicle, I cannot watch CHILDREN!! Especially when we care for children who are on the spectrum!! Like that’s just reckless. Wednesday I text her telling her it’s the worst it’s been and I’m scared I might have to take Friday off. I hadn’t been able to eat anything because of the pain, I could hardly open my mouth and I was hunched over the toilet. I felt like I was going to puke and diarrhea at the same time but nothing would come out. Every 8 hours I take antibiotics and about every 2 hours im taking a minimum of 400mg of Hydrocodone. My body was collapsing in on itself. She tells me not to and go wait until tomorrow to see how I feel, instead of just trying to find coverage since it’s so hard and cancelling the sub if I can come in. Anyway Friday comes around and I don’t go in I’m still in pain but I did see the surgeon and by Sunday I was feeling a lot better.  ALSO the kids wrote me sweet letters and my neighbor (who works the same job at a different site) brought them to me and I was going through them and she WROTE on one of their letters... Not a sticky note on the letter but just wrote on the card.... 

Everything was fine for awhile, but one day I stayed a little late in Math (which I was getting a D in, math is just hard for me) for help before my exam and I texted her I’d be a little later than usual because traffic had picked up. Literally if traffic hadn’t started I would’ve been there at my usual time maybe 5 min late. I ended up being 15 min late which is my bad like I’m not trying to say I’m not in the wrong, but she talked to me about it and I explained my grades and how I was doing in the class. She said for me to think about her, she has to be alone with them for an hour without me and it’s terrible. The next day I go in she asks to talk to me outside and lectured me saying she tried to do school and work too but that she had to choose one over the other, so essentially I would need to prioritize one thing over the other. She brought it up another time outside of this conversation insinuating I prioritize the job. She also asked me to text her when I was leaving school and on my way to work and asked me to show her what I was working on when I’d come in.. 

I started to feel like she just wanted to control what I was doing and didn’t trust that I was doing my work in creating activities? Despite trying to come up with games to play with the kids or activities that incorporated science with art? I always came up with new ideas for my activities and the kids loved me and hated her. Whenever she’d call out and we’d have a sub the kids would practically celebrate and talk shit about her. 

Anyway, late November before thanksgiving break I told the director I wanted to leave at the end of December. When I told the kids they were not happy, the kids I connected with complained it would be terrible because they were stuck with her during my surgery and they were scared lol. I told them they would be fine and I’d visit and they’d probably get someone who’s really cool and wanted to hang with them too. I miss them a lot and I wish I could still play volleyball and paint along with Bob Ross videos with them. 

Bonus story if you like the drama:

There was an activity where the kids were making balloon towers and one of the boys was pretending to kick another groups tower over (the activity was over the winners were chosen) and he accidentally knocked it over. The girls teased and said his name but didn’t care, my supervisor though was NOT pleased. She said that was rude and that “if he had it in his heart he should apologize to them,” and as she walked away, “and it should be sincere.” I froze, I was so shocked.. talking to a 7th grader like that? She went to her desk and called the winners over, he said sorry looking pale as a ghost and walks to his table. He punches the chair 2-3x then the table and puts his head down in his arms and is crying. His friend looks over and I motion him to come and talk outside, I asked if he said anything before it or if it was just the situation that took place. He said it was the situation and he had been having a bad day. 3 days prior we had training where we were reminded to treat kids fairly because we don’t know where they’re coming from or what’s going on in their life. It just really hurt me to see him like that, so I went to her and I told her what had happened since she was oblivious to it and she said it’s fine he needs to get over it. Maybe that’s true but I feel like these kids are so young and impressionable and that could really mess with their confidence for awhile. 

Also, she had a desk and I had to sit at the children’s table to do all my work. I used to put my stuff in a cubby then she started filling it so I put my stuff on the floor. Idk a minor thing that just added to the feeling of her not having a mutual respect. 

TL;DR supervisor talked to me like I was one of the children we care for, complained about my availability I was hired with, and asked me to come in on my second day of a 1 week sick leave for a wisdom tooth recovery (all 4 teeth, terribly slow recovery). Also made a student cry. None of the students liked her and I didn’t either. 

I don’t want it to seem like I’m saying I’m perfect and I haven’t been in the wrong!! I’m just sharing my frustrations and I know I could’ve handled things differently too, but what’s done is done! Some of these things really don’t bother me the same way they did but it’s just something I wanted to share. [also she talked like this ](https://twitter.com/aribigshoes/status/1228957992583942149?s=21) sorry this thang so long",2020-02-17 21:42:53
The girl I was training got in a fight with my coworker,108,f3fmlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/f3fmlf/the_girl_i_was_training_got_in_a_fight_with_my/,15,1581623156.0,"Almost a year and a half ago (19F), I was working at Starbucks and I was training my first barista, who was a returning partner. The first day we sat in the back she was doing the online training and she saw the schedule and asked if M worked there. I loved M, she was 16, we usually closed together and we just had a lot of fun together. I told her she did and I loved her, and the girl I was training, J said, M’s boyfriend tried to hook up with me last month. I was shocked I didn’t know what to say, she explained that he was her ex and last month they hung out and caught up and he brought up sleeping together. 

J was not going to stay at our store, I was training her for 6 days over 2 weeks then she’d go to her new store. She said she was scared to see M because of the boyfriend situation, so I just said to keep working and I checked the schedule and they only worked together once, and it was a 30 min overlap so it wasn’t a big deal and we could just stay in the back. I didn’t want to tell M the situation that J told me because I didn’t want to make things worse if M didn’t know her. So I figured I would tell her after J went to her new store. Well, the day comes around and M comes in and sees her, doesn’t say anything. M didn’t seem to know who J was at all, so everything was fine they even joked a little and we minded our business. Our supervisor left and put me in charge while she ran to get lunch on her 30.

Well... M’s boyfriend came in to drop off lunch, J and I were doing dishes so we both walked out to put them away and the boyfriend made eye contact with J, she immediately walked back into the back and M looked at her boyfriend and said, “ is that why you’ve been acting weird?? Because she’s here?” She walked away from the register and into the back and closed the back door that leads from the FOH to the BOH. There was a customer so I was trying to get their drink quickly so I could go into the back. I heard something and looked through the little window on the door and saw hair and hands flying. The boyfriend saw too and ran INTO OUR BACKROOM to help break it up. I ran in too and he literally ran in and kicked J’s chest to push her down, she fell to the ground with M’s hair in her hand bringing her down too, and I’m not joking when I say he stomped on J like a roach. Probably 2-3 times did he stomp on her chest when she was already on the ground and I was trying to pull M away. 

Luckily the supervisor had just come back, everyone in the lobby is trying to see, I told my shift what happened and while they called the manager and talked I stayed in the front to take orders. They let me go back a little later to give my side of the story and figure out what was going on. Both of them were getting sent home and I went outside to change the trashes and J was sitting at the table next to one waiting for her dad to get her, I asked how she was feeling and if she needed anything. Then as M and her boyfriend are walking to their car they start shouting at J taunting her, and J’s dad got there and started getting heated too calling them punks. It seemed like there was gonna be another fight between the boyfriend and dad but my manager went and broke it up. 

J did not get to keep working at Starbucks, M was terminated and she blamed me for everything. For me that was the worst part of it, I considered her a good friend, and I had told one of the other shifts like I knew they were ex’s but I didn’t want to bring it up in case it upset M, and that shift told M. M texted me saying If I was her friend I would’ve told her first and taken her side, when I hadn’t taken anyone’s side. I tried explaining I didn’t do it to hurt her or to keep it from her, but I knew they’d have a shift together so I didn’t want it to cause tension, and that I didn’t even know if it was true, so I didn’t know if she was just stirring the pot. I understand her point of view and maybe if I was in that position today I would’ve handled it better, but it is what it is.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk

Edit:  Also!! Why was no one mad at the boyfriend??? I’m not the one trying to mess with my ex, I just tried to avoid a conflict. Thanks for the support peeps",2020-02-13 21:45:56
Keep your shoes on!,96,f2m7ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/f2m7ua/keep_your_shoes_on/,2,1581485161.0,"I'm not sure which ""tales from X"" subreddit this fits in, but here's a story from my job at the local zoo.  I'll be blunt, I don't work with the animals, my job has nothing to do with the animals, your lucky I even know where most of them are.  I was in one of the little snack shacks, this one is kinda centrally located, being at the crossroads of two big paths.  

This lady, we'll call her Karen, runs up and starts banging on the side door of my shack.  BTW, she had to walk past the service window to get to this door, so there was no need to do this.  I open the door and she starts screaming at me that one of the kids in her school group lost a shoe at ""Elk Cove,"" and that I needed to get it for her.  We do have an elk exhibit, it's called Elk Meadow, not ""elk cove"" but it is relatively close by.  Unfortunately I am not a trained zoo keeper, I'm a cashier at a hot dog stand.  I tell Karen that I can't leave my register, then I offered to call someone who might be able to help.  She won't take that, and keeps screaming at me because how could I let a 12 year old walk around without a shoe.  I wanted to tell her that she was the chaperone responsible for keeping the kid from throwing his shoe in the exhibit, instead I dialed reception and told Karen again that I'm calling someone to get help.

Reception finally picked up, it was our crotchety older British lady receptionist, We'll call her V.  V has a bit of an attitude, so generally we don't like getting her on the phone when we call reception.  But I'm glad I got her this time, and I am now eternally thankful to her.

Karen finally stops screaming long enough for me to tell V what happened, and V asks which part of the exhibit the shoe is in.  I relayed the question to Karen, who replied, ""I already told you!  ELK COVE. E-L-K C-O-V-E!""

""Yes, but what part of Elk Cove?"" I asked again.

""ELK COVE!""

At this point I should mention that the actual elk exhibit was set back from the viewing area, and most of the paddock right by the viewing platform was actually the grey wolf exhibit, just a small part on one side is accessible by the elk. (don't ask me why the Zoo had these two exhibits together)

I told V that the lady just keeps saying Elk Cove, V reminded me that the wolves are most of the area by the viewing deck, and suggested that the shoe probably is in there.
I tried one more time, ""Was it in the Elk part or the Wolf part.""

""I told you.  ELK COVE!""

At that point, V has me tell her that they can't get the shoe until tonight, because they have to put the animals away first.
Karen didn't like that, she went ballistic about how I was refusing to help and that now this poor kid won't have a shoe.  I should march down there right now, climb in and get the shoe.  How hard could it be?
I still had the crotchety British receptionist on the phone, so I just handed the handset to Karen.   Karen proceeded to berate V about how terrible this zoo is that they won't help her.  When she stopped and listened for a couple of minutes, I knew V was dishing it all back out.  Karen dropped the phone and stormed off.  I assume someone was able to get the shoe eventually.",2020-02-12 07:26:01
The crazy woman at Carglass,35,f0kqxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/f0kqxh/the_crazy_woman_at_carglass/,15,1581126745.0,"This is my very first post on Reddit, so please be patient with me.

This happened a few years ago when I had an internship at a carglass replacement/repair shop, I was put in charge of handling incoming deliveries. Controlling windshields for cracks/other general damage (becomes important for later) and being a general help at the shop.  One day we get a woman coming in late for her booked time to change her windshield, 1,5 hour late. She looked like a typical upper class woman, fur coat, perfect hair, drove a brand new Mercedes S-class and a long haired chiuaua. 

Naturally we didn't have time to sit around and wait for her so we had taken in other cars for repairs. I was in the office/reception when she walks in. The following conversation went along the lines of; 
 
(C is from now on customer, B is my boss, CW are the coworkers.)

C - ""Hi I'm here to change my windshield"" 

B - ""Sorry, you are 1,5 hour late. The workshop is full, I can rebook you"" 

C - ""But I need it changed today"" 

B - ""We can't help you, the workshop is full"" 

C - ""Well then, I'll just go in and talk to them myself""

She then proceeds to just walk straight out into the workshop where customers are NOT allowed to be. Says clearly on the door. The floor is full off glass shards, with her dog, I immedately run out from the office to stop her. Only thinking about the dog that's already bleeding from his paws. She then starts screaming at my coworkers.

C - ""Yes hello, can any of you move one these cars out of here?"" 

CW - ""Sorry what? No, we can't. This car dosen't even had a windshield in yet and the other one can't be stored outside because it's raining"" 

C - ""I don't have time for this, move this car out of here and get my car in. I have a meeting in 1 hour that I need to get too""

CW - ""Are you stupid or just deaf? WE CAN'T MOVE THE CARS!"" 

Me - ""Sorry ma'am but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the workshop and wait in the reception. This is a no go place for customers""

C - ""You don't look like your up to anything important, go get my car and start working"" 

She drops the keyes into my hand and gestures for me to go out and drive her car in.

Me - ""Sorry but I can't drive your car, I'm only 17"" 

(In sweden where I live the age limit for driving is 18)

C - ""Then what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in school?"" 

Me - ""I'm an intern, this is part of my education."" 

My coworkers have now stopped their work to come help me since C is becoming more and more aggresive in her tone. 

CW - ""Could you please go out into the reception, you can't be in here. Especially not with your dog.""

C - ""DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!""

Both my CW:s and me all say at the same time; No, and frankly we don't give a shit. 

Customer is getting more and more angry at this point and shouting loudly. This is where our boss, a fantastic man that I loved working with. He is 2 meters tall, bald head and very fit. Steps out of the office with a look like he's about to pick this lady up and yeet her to the other side of the atlantic ocean. He walks up to the customer, bends over her like the fucking hulk and let's out a rant that I'll never forget.

B - ""Get the fuck out of my workshop"" 

C - ""No, I will not leave before my windshield is fixed""

B - ""WE. WILL. NOT. FIX. YOUR. FUCKING. CAR.""

C - ""I have a time booked""

B - ""That was almost 2 hours ago, if you're late we will not wait. Now take your fucking floormop excuse for a dog and the FUCK OUT OF MY ESTABLISHMENT""

Customer finally looks down at her poor dog (I was ready to punch her face in and take the dog away at this point because he was in bad pain) and starts screaming about how she is going to sue us for the injuries we have inflicted on her dog and that's she's never coming back to this place.

She starts walking to the door and my boss just screams at her; Bye you fucking cocksucking piece of shit. 

After that I always asked to have my future internships at that place.",2020-02-08 03:52:25
Do you send nudes?,49,f0gldu,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/f0gldu/do_you_send_nudes/,2,1581108302.0,"This story takes place at a nail salon I use to work at. It's kind of short and a light funny and weird

So one day a had 2 clients at the same time. A mother and daughter, I just got finished with the mother and was work on the daughter's manicure. They were really nice and we talked a lot.

While I was doing her manicure. Coworker and Boss were also doing clients manicures and they were having their own conversation. I was not paying any attention to what they were says because I was so focused on my clients conversation.

Out of no where, my bosses client (bc) literally yells at me across the room and said

BC: do you send nudes

Me: (in shock and hoping she didnt just ask that) what?

BC: do you send nudes in high school?

Me: ummm no

BC: oh well you haven't gotten to that age yet

Me: uhhhh...

BC: how old are you?

Me: 20

BC: oh... never mind


I am so confused and extremely embarrassed that I was asked that by probably a 50 or 60 year old lady in front of everyone.

I looked at my client (c) and said

Me: what just happened

C: I am just as confused as you are

While I was talking to my clients again, I could hear them making fun of me for not sending nudes in high school 

🤷‍♀️

Just so you know, my client wasn't even in high school yet. So that made her uncomfortable, and it also made her mom uncomfortable that and old lady just yelled that. 

Lol even if I did send nudes in high school, I wouldnt yell it out to a bunch of strangers

Note: you can NOT be a nail tech and work in a nail salon without going to school for it, and I THINK you have to be graduated. Just depends on the state you live in and the school you want to go to.",2020-02-07 22:45:02

But basically I am a nail tech who use to work at a salon, that I will not name, where I was mistreated. I also feel like you should know that I DO NOT LIKE CONFLICT, so some of these stories I dont stick up for myself BECAUSE I had no where else to go (job wise) and I HATE arguing and will try my best to avoid it in anyway.

Part 1 I gave everyone nick names (i didnt use everyone's nickname because I didnt know if I was going to use them or not, but I probably will in this one, plus 2 more)  so I will write down all their nick names again

Bosses oldest kid- B1

Bosses youngest kid- B2

Coworker- C

Coworkers oldest kid- C1

Coworkers youngest kid- C2

Neighbor- N

Neighbors kid- N1

B and C are sisters btw 

In part 1 I gave a list of the stories that evolved my food being taken, but I forgot one. And this one made me SO MAD, that it made me want to quit that day because I have had enough. 

Let me set the stage for you 

Ncame over one day to get acrylics done by C, N also brought N1 to get her nails done too (I did them). N1 has her good and bad moments, it was a pretty good moment so I was thinking it wasnt going to be too bad. Well N was going to be busy after her nails were done so she left N1 at the salon ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY. So now there are 4 kids at this salon. B2 is a really good kid, all he does is sit in the back and plays his iPad and stays quiet, so you dont even know he is there. B1 and C1 are kind of crazy. Like a rollercoaster, some times they are wild or fighting and screaming at each other, and sometimes they are just chillin. N1... ooof, she can be mean, loud, she is VERY manipulative and she knows it, cuz she is sneaky with it, she is very bossy too. Putting all the 1 kids together is a mess. It's so loud and annoying, to hear fighting and screaming and rude comments to each other all day... 

ANYWAYs. I wasnt busy after I finished N1s nails, so I was sent to get pizza for the kids. Which I didnt mind because it was literally 2 minutes down the street and everyone else was too busy to do it, and also N gave me the money to do it. So I brought back the pizza and the kids devoured that thing. A couple minutes go by, N is gone. N1 comes out and says she messed up her nail, so I fix it, and I put a little extra fast drying stray on that nail. 5 minutes later she comes out and says she scratches it again, I fix it again with a lil MORE drying spray. About an hour goes by she comes back out and says there was a scratch on her finger, I ask which one. Instead of showing me one of her finger, she waves her hand in my face and says 

N1: it's just there can you fix it

Me: which finger

N1: can you just fix it

Me: which one needs fixed

N1: this one 

She finally shows me a finger, but keeps wiggling it so I cant see it. I ask her to stop and she does.... there is nothing there

Me: there is nothing there

N1: there is a scratch 

Me: where

N1: *wiggles finger* there

Me: where on the nail, is a scratch

N1: *points* there

Me: there is nothing there

N1: can you just fix it

I just give up and put another coat of polish on it... another hour goes by and she comes back with the same act but this time B is sitting next to me and she knows what is going on. 

N1: can you fix it

Me: I already fixed your nails 4 times 

N1: but I scratched it again

Me: where

N1: *shows another imaginary scratch*

Me: there is nothing there

N1: fix it

Me: there is nothing to fix you are fine

C: let me see

N1: *shows B finger but wiggles it so she cant see anything*

C: stop wiggling I cant see anything

N1: *stops*

C: there is nothing there

N1: yes ther..

C: no go in the back

She goes in the back, and 5 minutes later comes back out, but this time she brings an army... she brought C1 with her. 

C1: Mommy can you fix C1s finger

C: there is nothing wrong with it

C1: can you fix her finger

N1: fix my finger

C: (looks at me like, I'm so sorry) can you fix her finger one more time

C: C1 this is the last time

Me: *fixes the finger*

N1: can you paint the other one too

C: B**** GO IN THE BACK RIGHT NOW, NO MORE

Well... I thought the rest of the day was going to be fine, this is the food part of the story

I was starting to get hungry and the kids pizza smelled really good, but I was craving a deep dish. Mmmmmmm. So I went 2 minutes down the road to get me some pizza. Came back with it and sat in tbe back room, none of the kids were there, I have no idea where they were. I finish one slice of pizza, I got 7 more to go. The kids show back up and C1 sees I am eatting pizza

C1: Mmmm pizza I want pizza

Me: you have pizza

C1: we ate it all

Me: oh

C1: I want your pizza, give me your pizza

Me: I already got you pizza

That whole time B1 and N1 are standing behind her like. If she takes pizza, we are taking it too.
She gets distracted by something and leave me alone... until 2 minutes later. THIS TIME she comes in acting like she hasn't seen the pizza before, reaches her had in my pizza box, grabs a piece and says OH PIZZA? I push her hand away and say firmly (also trying to stay calm but i am very pissed)

Me: No C1 this is MY pizza you already had pizza

She give me this evil braty look and says 

C1: sharing is caring

And crosses her arms like. Ooohhh I got YOU. Btw B1 and N1 are still standing behind her like dogs, waiting for their signal to attack
I'm just in shock, 1 because she said that I was suppose to share more food with her when she already had food. 2 because she is allowed to act like this and 3 HER MOM IS WATCHING EVERYTHING BUT WHEN I LOOK AT HER SHE LOOKS AWAY AND ACTS LIKE SHE HASNT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION
THE WHOLE TIME, and it obviously isn't a quiet conversation, so both B and C can hear what is going on. Also after I bought the pizza for the kids, B, left right after and brought back 2 family meals from bojangles, so they are obviously not starving, they just want anything that I am eating. 

After C1 said that, N1 came in my face (probably as a distraction) and KISSES ME AND SAYS I LOVE YOU. I have no idea what is going on so I say ok... C1 still is trying to take my pizza (I haven't even finished a 2nd piece and the piece are small, and I haven't eaten that whole day) so I stand up, kids look up at me pretty scared because they know I am mad and I did NOT hide it. I closed the box, walked outside, and put my pizza in my car, came back in the salon, didnt talk (because if I did I would have exploded) and waited until I got home to finish eating ... at 7 pm

But WAIT there is more, Grandma brings C2 to the salon... he is BANNED FROM THE SALON BECAUSE HE IS SO UNBELIEVABLY BAD AND HE IS ONLY 1. He has poured out dip powder (expensive) brakes things, hides things, SCREAMS ALL THE TIME, kicks, bites, punches, soooooo much more, AND THEY DECIDE TO ADD HIM TO ALL THIS CHAOS. He is running around scream, hitting people, throwing things, messing with the other kids which makes them mad and now they are screaming and running around, its just... hell

And do you know what B and C are doing... acting like nothing is happening like ""oh yeah this is normal"" ""happened all the time"" ""this is why he isn't allowed here lol"". Why they did not tell Grandma to take C2 back home because he was being so bad... idk, but that was probably one of the worse days of my life. I cant even explain to you everything that happened in words that day, but it was awful. I'm surprised I didnt have a headache with all that racket alllll dayyyy. I wanted to cry honesty 

So I didnt know this story was going to be so long, so I am going to have to make a part 3 to the job stories. And just so you know, all this happened in 1 day

I hope you have a great day, and I hope it is better than this one lol",2020-01-24 06:37:45

Stories of my food being messed with:
1.)
The first time my food was ever messed with was when I took a whole week of food with me. (I was going on a cruise the week after and I wanted to save some money and not eat out). Now, all the kids that are allowed at the salon are old enough to know what is and isn't theirs. But just to make sure, I put all my food in a bag AND TIDE IT, and labeled the food that need to be refrigerated. I brought a container of chicken salad, a box of 4 croissants, and a box of cheezits. The next day I went into the back room for lunch. My bag was untied and the box of croissants was OPENED, but not eaten. The 2nd time my food was messed with and ALSO THE NEXT DAY, my box of cheezits was ALMOST EMPTY, and I remember only eatting a hand full of cheezits the day before. I was only left with not even 1/4 a box of cheezits. I figured out it was the kids who ate them, SO trying not to get super upset, I went to B and c and told them that their kids ate almost all my cheezits... this is what they said

B: Oh they didnt eat it, they were playing with it

C: Yeah I think I saw them making shapes and pictures with them

... I got no apology. I would rather the kids eat my food than play with my food and waste $5 worth of crackers.

3rd time they ate my food. I brought my tide bag of food, I dont remember everything that was in it but I remember I had yogurt and cheese sticks that was eaten from it.

4TH TIME WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
SO for example, because I dont remember the exact day, MONDAY I went to Moe's to pick up food for everyone  (Mexican grill, kind of like a subway but for burritos, tacos, and stuff. So delicious) and I got a Wrong Doug, it's kind of like a crunch wrap from taco bell but better. The other ladies got a burrito. The Wrong Doug comes in a bowl like container with a lid on it, and also comes with free chips inside that container. The burritos come in a bag with free chips in the same bag. So I am the only one that has that container. That day I finish my Wrong Doug but not the chips, so I leave it in the back room. The next day I am sitting at my desk, and I hear B eatting something over near the waiting area but I was to focused on my phone atthe time (we have no clients at this time, so we sometimes sit over there because it's more comfortable than our desk chairs) about 20 minutes go by and B's client walks in and says ""go ahead and finish eating I will wait"". Well now I'm kind of curious what she is eating... AND IT MY CHIP IN MY CONTAINER. I didnt say anything because I dont like conflict and I was also in shock because of how many times my food had been eaten, messed with and played with. But I give her this look like... Are those my chips? Idk if she got what I was trying to say, but she did kind of give me this look like...oh no. These weren't mine...ok so I probably wasnt going to eat the chips anyway, but she didnt ask if she could have them, she didnt pay for my meal, and she didnt pay for the gas to get me to Moe's. If she would have asked I would have said yes.


Other than eatting my food, they would also take my clients

The first time (that I know of) I walk into work. We have a schedule book that tells everyone their appointments that are coming up. I didnt normally look at the schedule book in the morning but that morning I kind of felt like I should. I had a client scheduled that morning at 10 to get a mani/pedi. This person was a new client so I didnt know what they looked like. My client walked in, C had a client at 10 also but her client was later. (C and B speak mong and english. I cant speak mong but I can figure out what they are saying with their body language) B basically told C in mong to take my client while she waited for her late client. Her last client also wanted mani/pedi. So C did my clients pedi. C's client walked in, she gave me my client back but I only got the money for doing a mani. C did her clients mani and asked if she still wanted a pedi, her client said no. I could tell that C was a little concerned the her client didnt want a pedi anymore because she acted like she was going to give me her clients pedi to make up for the pedi she took from me. From then on I looked at my schedules every morning. 
(I hope that store made sense, I know it was a mess lol)

Another time they took a client from me was when, I was doing my clients pedicure. Towards the end of the pedicure my client told me she wanted to schedule for another pedicure in a couple of weeks, I told her I would schedule it when she went to pay. I walk away for 30 seconds to put away some dirty towels from that pedicure. Apparently that gave my client enough time to go over and pay B for her pedi, and she also asked B to make a new appointment. Instead of B putting MY client in MY schedule spot, she put MY client in HER schedule spot...There goes another one of my clients 

Just so you know, I didnt do booth rent, I did  commission. So if I did $100s worth of service I only go 60% of that. So if I lose a client, I am also losing a lot of money. So she was basically stealing my money. 

B also wouldnt let me do certain (excessive) services like Dip powder because she said I wasnt experienced with polishing (that would also mean, less clients for her more for me) Let me just say, I have been painting nails since I was allowed to open the bottle and even then I would sneak into my mom's room and paint my nails, I started really getting into nails when I became a teenager, I love doing nail art, I am 20 now, so there is about 7 or more years of experiences. So when she told me I wasnt experienced with polishing, she made it sound like one day I just decided to go to nail school without knowing how to do anything, and go straight to a salon.

I have a lot more story's about my old job. I might make a part 2 if anyone wants more. Some of them are crazier than these",2020-01-21 08:32:59
Something that I wanted to share,83,elnk3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/elnk3z/something_that_i_wanted_to_share/,1,1578457205.0,"I was reading some stories of hostile work environments were you had people abusing their power and being unpleasant for real reason, or they are having a bad day and took it out on others who had nothing to do with the situation but were in the way. After reading these, I wanted to share my experience with someone who is paid to be mean.

I'm working in a place that's semi-private semi-public with a lot of locations around the US east coast. While I do live in a right to work state, my job gets regulated at a federal level so it's hard to fire troubled employees. 

My worksite also became infected with small cliques that would disrupt work with how petty they were, examples include keeping track of how often the other clique would use the bathroom and for how long, sending products back to review because they didn't trust the other cliques work or wanted to make them look bad, etc.

Luckily, or unfortunately for these people, my old company had a dedicated ""interpersonal conflict manager"" in my state, well ""professional b****"" is the most accurate term. 

Her job was to come into locations that had issues with cliques forming and then she proceeded to tear down ever sense of self worth that these people had. She interrupted social events and shutting them down if they didn't have the right authorization or break time, put rival clique members together on a task and punished them with extra work (we were salaried) if they didn't get the job done, and she had authority to deny people leave from the donation pool, and more.

(About the donation pool: we get a set amount of leave per month and it doesn't roll over to next year if you collect too much. You can 'donate' the hours that won't pass on so people who have no leave but have an emergency can take from it)

Most of her work on my site was before I started to work there and was there for only two weeks more after my start day. By the end of her visit, the clique members were either miserable, quit, or started to cooperate.

The funniest thing is that she is one of the sweetest women I know (as long as you weren't causing trouble). I got locked out of a building my first week, my supervisor wasn't picking up, and to top it all off I didn't pack lunch so I was miserable that day. She found me outside when she came back from lunch, pulled me into her office, and then gave me some macaroni and cheese, water, and a piece of candy while she located my manager and sent an email to HR to get me a set of keys. She talked with me on how my week was and if there was anything else I wanted to know about my job. She made me feel a lot better.

TL;DL: My job has the Wicked Witch of the West on reserve to break the spirit of trouble makers, she also happens one of the friendliest people I know.",2020-01-08 06:20:05
Hole watch/fire watch,51,ekw3ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ekw3ku/hole_watchfire_watch/,4,1578326900.0,"I was a part of a rescue crew that would go into plants when they were down to allow renovations. I was assigned to night shift and we did twelve hour shifts. As hole watch, you monitor oxygen levels and who goes in and out of
Confined spaces. It's a loud and boring job. Occasional injuries but nothing to severe. When a plant goes down, we HAVE to be there with the contractors. So for about a month or so, I'd go without a day off. I still can't tell if I chalk this up to sleep deprivation. But I was about three stories up and the contractors go on their lunch break. I have to stay at the hole to assure nobody goes in. The stairs up to this boiler are metal industrial stairs so you can feel when somebody is walking up them. You feel the vibrations. We have to wear earplugs because some of the pump trucks are loud as hell. For a week straight I'd feel the vibrations coming up to my floor and I'd hear someone say my name from a few feet away. I'd take out the earplugs and look over and no body would be there, obviously. I was the only person on this unit. The contractors would always take lunch at 1:30 AM and come back at 2:30 AM. For the last week of the outage I just remember feeling super uneasy for that hour. It would happen at least once but sometimes twice within that hour. It happended everyday for that last week. It only happened to me on unit three. I got my supervisors to test my monitors to make sure they're functional (and to make sure there wasn't a gas leaking potentially poisoning me, causing hallucinations) so I assumed it was sleep deprivation. Thinking on it however, I was always caffeinated. I never fell asleep or felt like I was falling asleep. But I guess I'll never know. Lol this was the only job it happened on. I thought it was kinda creepy and weird, so I shared it.",2020-01-06 18:08:20

Customer wants discount for being White,109,ej1prv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ej1prv/customer_wants_discount_for_being_white/,11,1577988408.0,"So I used to work at my local zoo at the front just mainly checking people in, answering phones, filling our spreadsheets. It was a very simple job with good pay. On one slow day we had a number of people calling in for some reason. Normal questions were about prices, hours, and the occasional “Can I speak to Dr.Monkey” prank calls. The next call I got was very interesting. It was a woman who was calling to ask for prices. I go through my normal script on prices per age. She then asks me, word for word, “Is there any discount for a WHITE adult?”! I was taken aback. I asked her “I’m sorry I didn’t catch that”, and in a totally serious tone she said firmly “DO YOU HAVE ANY DISCOUNTS FOR WHITE ADULTS?”. Now where I live it’s predominantly Hispanic so not really used to interactions like this. I just ending up telling her as professionally as I could “No I’m sorry we don’t give discounts based on race, that would be racist”. She, no lie, tells me “Well that doesn’t make sense” and hung up. To this day I’m not entirely sure if it was a prank or a legit question. My money is on the latter cause she sounded how a typical Karen would. 🤷🏻‍♂️",2020-01-02 20:06:48
Coworker Denies his memes are Racist,53,ei8dww,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ei8dww/coworker_denies_his_memes_are_racist/,11,1577824233.0,"This was about a week or two ago that the incident first happened. I work in a movie theater and learned that when two coworkers were working in box office, 

My one coworker (I’ll call her A and the other guy B) came to me at the end of a long day of working in box, very frustrated.  Apparently, B had been showing her memes that she found racist (she is black for context). 

He was laughing at the memes he showed her as she looked at him with a very obvious pissed off and confused expression. His reaction? “You don’t get it do you”

This didn’t happen once while in box, but during their whole shift. When I confronted B the next day, he told me they weren’t racist. A confronted him another day, he still said they weren’t racist.

This past week he got written up for racist comments, I hope he has learned and won’t do this again but who knows.

Tales from the nail salon,122,egxcgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/egxcgd/tales_from_the_nail_salon/,5,1577572292.0,"So here's a little collection of stories from the last two weeks. Enjoy. 

Obligatory warning that I'm posting via mobile.

Story 1:

I'm doing a mini manicure on a 5 year old. She won't stop moving, which I can accept because, well, shes 5. 

She asks me about my hair (bright green box braids) and I tell her all about them. She's very excited about my irish accent (I'm in new zealand) and she tells me all about her grandfather, who is from Kinsale, and about how she's going to open a feijoa stand over the summer so she can save up and go to ireland. Its very cute, and her mam seems pleased as punch that her kid is being friendly. At the end of the treatment, her mam says something to the effect of ""look at the nice lady's nails!"" Since mine are currently long and green. I obligingly hold them out for her to inspect, and kiddo says in her finest indoor voice:

""Green is my least favourite colour!""

Her poor mam looked like she was going to melt with embarrassment, having gotten this far without a foot in mouth moment after talking about my green hair, but I just laugh and ask her what her most favourite colour is. Turns out it's pink and purple. Can't really be offended by a five year old with no filter, it's not the worst thing she could have said XD 

Story 2

An adult client this time, getting her nails done for her wedding. She seems nice, we have great chats throughout her pedicure, and she seems happy. Shes getting a French paint, and has chosen a sheer sparkly colour to go over the ring finger on her hands. She makes it clear when I start her hands that it needs to be PERFECT, because the photographer is going to be taking pictures of her hands and is a stickler for detail. Ok, fine, I'm meticulous, I can do this, though it might take a little longer.

I spend a long time on her french paint, making sure it's as perfect as I can get it. At every single step she inspects my work, pointing out even the tiniest flaw regardless of how much left I have to do. I usually do two thin layers of white at the tips to make sure they're even, and she points out that the first layer is patchy. I try to mollify her by telling her I'll be doing another layer to make it even, which she doesn't seem impressed with and lets me carry on.

She then complains that the tips are lumpy, which they aren't, and I attempt to very carefully buff them down a bit to make them smoother rather than remove the whole thing and do it again (gels, which would mean soaking them off and doing the whole paint-cure-paint-cure process all over again) I end up buffing some off anyway, which means redoing them anyway.

Finally, we come to the sparkly layer. I put it on her ring fingers first, and after much deliberation, she decides she wants the sparkles on all her nails. It's fine, it looks pretty, shes finally happy with them. We're almost home clear and I'm putting the topcoat on when she comes out with this:

""You know, I'm not very fussy usually, but i was going to go somewhere else and get them taken off and redone without telling you, but I like them so much better now!""

... ow, my feelings. An hour and a half of work would have gone down the drain only for those effing sparkles. I slap on my finest customer service smile and crack a joke about how sparkles make everything better, and she laughs and tells me I need that on a tshirt. She pays and leaves, and I'm still pretty peeved about that comment. Like, I would have understood if she just said she didn't like them, but there was no need for that. 

Story 3

My manager likes to bring her dog to work on occasion. He's very cute and typically well behaved. One day, manager decides to send me home early because we were pretty quiet, so I grab my stuff and head for the hills. I'm halfway home when I notice a new companion on my short walk home.

The dog followed me out of the salon and is  now with me, looking me like ""WHERE GOING?? I COME TOO!!""

I end up having to go back to the salon, where the manager is outside frantically calling for her dog. We crack a few jokes about my new best friend, and I go home. I was half tempted to keep him, but I don't think stealing my managers dog would be a good idea. Plus I'm not allowed pets at my house XD 

The moral of this story is: don't bring your dog to work.

Tl;dr: kid doesn't like green and wants to move to ireland, rude bride is rude and I accidentally stole my managers dog.",2019-12-29 00:31:32

I knew something was amiss when the teenage skate guard ran up to me with panic in her eyes. I never imagined it would happen. My theory is that a kid's diaper was leaking but I can't be sure I pretended it was throw up to ease my mind. Of course, it had to happen during our open skate so I had to shut that down while I chipped away at the frozen shards of stool. No I didn't snap a picture I was too busy dealing with the brown menace at hand. Never a dull moment at the ice rink",2019-12-28 17:06:03
The bathroom is a sacred space,22,ef3cgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ef3cgl/the_bathroom_is_a_sacred_space/,2,1577204139.0,"Anyone else work at a company with one bathroom?

I work in a shared building with other companies, but we have our own bathroom that is in the common hallway. And because of our shared building, people had been stealing our bathroom supplies so we now keep the door locked. But instead of getting a traditional ""occupied/vacant"" indicator lock, our boss got a sliding plastic board that one has to manually change as they go in/out.

Needless to say, half of the people either don't change it or don't look at it and proceed to try and open the door anyway, which is now only held closed by a (failing) slide lock. 

There is no worse feeling than someone trying to literally knock down the door as you are currently ""occupied"".

Today, not 10 minutes ago, I was doing my thing and I get a not so polite knock on the door. I respond ""occupied"", and continue getting knocks and then several attempts at opening the door. WTF!?

This is after at least a year of this sort of shit happening. (Pun intended)

"No thanks, meth head",87,ef2644,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ef2644/no_thanks_meth_head/,4,1577198490.0,"So I work the front desk in a 147-room hotel in a college town in the midwest. It's our slow season, so not many rooms are occupied, and I have time to get to know the faces of the ~~thousands of~~ six guests in the hotel. We're a four-star hotel right across from the police department in town, so it's a pretty safe place.

Two nights ago, I was working a really slow shift and a guy traipses into the lobby.

D for Dude (I'm guessing a meth head), M for me.

M: Welcome to the Schmoliday Out!

D: Do you have bathrooms?

M: I'm sorry, we don't have public restrooms. *\*Sometimes I'll let people use the bathrooms if they don't throw any red flags, but this guy came in with his skin hanging off his bones, extremely skinny, and was twitching a little. Very a-la-methhead. Also, a few months into the job, I made the mistake of letting a drug addict go to the bathroom. They came out, thank the heavens, but my supervisor was worried. Mind you, they didn't step in when I told them they could use the restroom. Back then, I thought we had public restrooms.*

D: Can I get a room then?

(Red flag number 2... suddenly you're willing to pay for a room when you just needed a bathroom a second ago?)

M (still suspicious): If we have anything left, sure. We have a couple of weddings in house tonight and a hot water issue has knocked a bunch of rooms out of service, so we may not have anything left. Just in case we do, we need a photo ID and a credit card for check in.

D: *\*pulls out a green ID card and a debit card. His left hand is covered in blood\** Here.

The bloody hand and the lack of a credit card and valid operator's license confirmed my suspicions. The guy was just looking for a place to shoot up for the night. I click the mouse a few times to fake looking at the screen, then break the news.

M: Looks like we're sold out of the rooms we have tonight. Sorry.

I keep a knife with me since I never know who is gonna come through the door, as do most people at my workplace, and I was ready to go for it if the guy tried to fight me. Luckily, he slunk out the door and into the night. I told my manager about it, he said good job, and that was the end of it. I went back to watching The Ranch on Netflix because the lobby was empty.

I know this wasn't the best story, but it's my first true encounter in seven months of working here that I've had of refusing service and dealing with a drug addict.

Edit: I offered to call an ambulance for the guy but he declined. That was also a factor in my decision.",2019-12-24 16:41:30
Lessons from the Food Pantry,29,ef0lho,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ef0lho/lessons_from_the_food_pantry/,3,1577189440.0," 

You learn a lot of things when you volunteer, such as data entry, proper shelf stocking protocol, and the fact that tamale powder and quick-cook oats exist solely to destroy any confidence you ever had in your upper body routine.

(Granted, you'd know all this if you had any amount of experience in a grocery store, but should you have been blessed enough to avoid that particular glory, consider filing that last bit away for later. It may save your life.)

Suffice to say, if you've worked in a grocery, you're already prepared for volunteering at a food pantry. The only thing left to learn, is how to love people, but this isn't hard. It only takes one person telling you how they don't have a refrigerator, but they DO have a beautiful kitchen table, before bursting into tears, to shatter any illusions of detachment.

I don't care who you are, you're hugging that person if they let you, and you're telling him or her that they're going to be okay, and you're meaning it, because at that moment, despite never having seen them before, you would do anything to make things better, even if it's something as inconsequential as getting them a coke from the fridge.

It takes an extreme amount of humility for a person to come up to a total stranger, and proclaim they have nothing and that they need your help.

So, depending on the size of the families coming in, we have shelved quantities of dry goods waiting for orders to go out. Once the computer decides to share this with us (frequently it doesn't), we put the food on a cart and add a final box for their frozen meats, produce, and breads/desserts when we have them.

An order for one is not insubstantial. (I can't remember the weight value, so you'll just have to trust me on this.)

We'd just finished pulling an order for one, when we were informed that this particular client didn't have a car. Or a home for that matter. He was staying at a hotel three or four blocks away. Not long after, a thin middle-aged man comes in, wearing a backpack, and immediately starts disemboweling the boxes, because he can only carry so much. Maybe a few cans, some cereal, the oranges are fine... The pantry manager materialized with a couple of duffel bags, which helped, but there's still that weight limit, and he was NOT a big guy.

A volunteer, lets call him Teddy, asks the pantry manager if he couldn't just drive him to his hotel, since he was staying so close. Manager says that we technically aren't allowed, and she doesn't want anybody to get in trouble.

Well, what about letting him take the cart? He can return it after he unloads.

No dice. The last person we did that for, stole the cart.

At that moment, Teddy very cautiously offers to push the cart back home for him. Manager is surprised, but this doesn't go against any protocol... and if the guy decided to do something shifty, we have all of his information on file. This could work.

The client looks Teddy up and down. Teddy is an olive to the client's toothpick, and could probably pick him up with minimal effort.

The client clears his throat. ""Yeah, you see... People around here know me, and I really don't want to be seen... With you.""

Oh. All right then. Teddy asks if he's sure, and the client emphatically asserts that he'll be fine, stuffs a bottle of Gatorade into his pants, and heaves out the door.

There was so much food left, he hardly scratched his order. He couldn't take any of the meat with him, or the pizza, or the heavier stuff like the milk, and the soul-sucking grits.

It was then that it hit me. Pride is so much more than an annoying armor that people gird themselves with.

It's a cage. It's a noose.

It prevents people from getting the fullness of what is offered to them. He had SO much food left over, and it was all his, but because of his pride, he missed out in a big way. And this is just food. (I might mention that he didn't use his clothing voucher for the thrift shop next door.)

What else has pride kept from him?

What has pride stolen from me? Or you? I can think of a few relationships that were strangled out, but how many more didn't even get a chance to grow?

It's insidious, which is why I'm asking you all now, to think carefully about the relationships and events in your life, both past and present. Is there someone who hurt you, that you refuse to reconcile with? Is there an opportunity you can't seize upon because you won't admit that someone else had a better idea, or that you were wrong to begin with?

Think hard on this, dig deep, and when you feel that rebellion swelling up in your throat, instead of breathing fire, take a moment to consider the bridges that are about to be burnt. Don't let pride steal what is rightfully yours.

""When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.""

Bloody Meat,9,eer0tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/eer0tm/bloody_meat/,1,1577137127.0,"I used to work at a sandwich shop where we sliced all of our meats in house. One day, my coworker came in plastered and the manager tells him to start slicing the roast beef. He cuts his hand on the blade, bad. Like, blood gushing, should go to the hospital. We don’t want the jerk of an owner to find out about this because there was a sign above the slicer that said “If you cut yourself while operating the slicer without wearing the protective glove, you will be fired.” We were not provided with a protective glove. We felt bad for the coworker that sliced his hand and accepted his alcoholism because he had lost his mother and his husband of 20 years that same year. So, my manager sends him home and tells me to wash the blood off of the roast beef, clean the machine, and finish slicing so that inventory wouldn’t be low and the owner wouldn’t know something was up. I was shocked. This was my first job, and I had never said “no” to a manager before. I told her that it was disgusting and unsafe and that we had to find another way to make sure that the owner didn’t find out. One of my coworkers was already planning on quitting, so she offered to stage the meat accidentally being dropped on the floor. She walked by the only functional kitchen camera and pretended to fall, launching the bloody meat. She got fired because “she wouldn’t have fallen if she was wearing newer nonslip shoes and she was a liability.” I quit shortly after.",2019-12-23 23:38:47

A fruit sized clitoris,129,ebtnd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ebtnd2/a_fruit_sized_clitoris/,6,1576574972.0,"So this story did not happened to me, I was told by the nurse who was teaching my hygiene classes. Sorry for the format, I’m on mobile.
So the story starts when Nurse is at the very beginning of her career, and she’s working for the Red Cross at a music festival. For some context, this festival is like half people actually there for the music, half people there just to do a bunch of drugs on the camping site. It’s unbelievably easy to get any drug you want on this camping, some people even died from overdose there. Also, there are piercing/tattoo booths on the site, which is super unhygienic.
So Nurse is chilling at the Red Cross, giving ear buds to people when two girls come in, one seems normal and the other one is tripping so hard she’s on another planet. Normal one is pushing Alien one inside and forces her to speak, and that’s when Alien one says that she has a tangerine sized clitoris. Nurse is the only woman here atm so she gets to check that out and indeed, her clitoris is as huge as the fruit. Turns out Alien girl went and got a piercing on her clitoris, and then went from tent to tent to fuck random people. Not only are the piercing booths there incredibly sketchy and I def would never get a piercing there, let alone on the clitoris ; but she didn’t even care to heal it correctly and had sex with (I assume pretty dirty) people on the camping site. Normal girl starts saying that Alien girl didn’t even want to come and have it looked at so she had to force her and she did well. Because Nurse decided to send her straight to the hospital, which was a great reflex cause over there they found out she had sepsis. So, had she not gone to the Red Cross, she would have been found dead in the morning. 
Morality: don’t get tattoos or piercings on a festival site and always take extra care to heal them properly or you might die.",2019-12-17 11:29:32
"Canadian Appliance Source - Vancouver, Canada",8,ebngjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ebngjh/canadian_appliance_source_vancouver_canada/,0,1576540373.0,"On November 25, 2019, I started my employment with Canadian Appliance in Vancouver Canada, East Broadway location. From the very start, it was apparent it was a less than ideal timing to begin my employment. A group layoff and resigning of multiple former colleagues left all the stores understaffed. Adding insult to injury, CAS opened their first location in Vancouver with last minute uncoordinated effort for store setup and advertising. CAS somehow launched the Vancouver location before proper setup and installation of floor models. The company overall appeared to be in a state of disarray and chaos with botched effort to mobilize workforce effectively. Multiple issues were reported from the basement flooding to store facilities. Customers were made to shiver in the cold and cover their ears from excessive deafening noises of drilling and hammering in the background while contemplating for a significant purchase decision with a rep.

I, as one of the two new hires, was able to quickly adapt to the chaotic state of working condition after the on-boarding training. I was the only staff member at the store other than the store manager. Since there were only 2 people working, you would think it's easy to just server the customer on  a first come first serve basis -- nope, we were coerced to use a archaic appointment portal that can't even look up a returning customer properly. With no communication or forewarning, management assigned me to working at multiple locations across Metro Vancouver area - I started my first day at Vancouver broadway location on its opening day. They re-assigned me to Coquitlam. Then they re-assigned me again to Surrey Newton. Without access to a vehicle, I took the public transit and taxicabs to travel between store locations. There was no communication in any shape or form (verbal, email or written).

I was able to generate decent amount of sales on Vancouver’s grand opening date solely based on walk-in clientele - again without any support from a coordinated marketing campaign, and with constant interruptions / distractions from non-sales related activities (e.g. fixing broken floor models). Conflicting contradictions were communicated about the proper usage of the backend systems, proper after-sale cares, proper customer care liaison (e.g. don’t care), and last but not least, consistent communication of customized pricing packages and customers retention. With professionalism and patience I tactfully worked around these obstacles while harnessing a good rapport with my fellow CAS co-workers across all levels. On December 11, I closed the store with the store manager with no issue after a day of operation. On December 14, I reported to the same location. Over 45 minutes, the store managers showed up late. I was then handed a letter of termination from Diane Mobar without any explanation.

Thanks for the advance?,32,e9q8yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/e9q8yw/thanks_for_the_advance/,1,1576170094.0,"IDK if this belongs here, but I figured I'd share this little tale as a lowly hourly wage slave.

So this happened almost 12 years ago. I worked for 3 years at a higher end fast food restaurant that specializes in chicken sandwiches (not the one that beings with a ""P"", they're garbage). It was my first job and the general manager is a great guy all around and extremely understanding, but kind of a tight ass (started at $7.25 and left at $8.25 after 3 years, after being trained in every position and effectively helped run the store when supervisors were absent). For Christmas, we had a party where everyone came in on Sunday to celebrate, ate free food, get handed out awards such as Most Improved, Most Team Player, etc, and also given goals, things to improve on, the usual. So we were given our annual Christmas bonus. As this was my first job, I was ecstatic. Everyone said, ""Don't get your hopes up"". I asked why, they said ""You'll see"". So all of the standard employees (idk what the supervisors and managers got) were given a $50 dollar Visa gift card. Sounds good right? Kind of. When the paychecks came through the following week, I looked at it and there was a deduction of $50 for ""Cash advance"" or something like that. So they pretty much gave everyone just a $50 advance for the next paycheck. I asked around and the veterans said this is how it was. I did a little more digging. I heard through the grapevine, and from managers who were just promoted that I worked alongside with and were friends with, that the GM is given X amount a year for how much money the restaurant saves. Things taken into account are salaries for managers, wages for normal employees, and operational costs. So by taking money out of our checks and giving them to us in advance, the GM saved maybe roughly $1500 in cost since it wasn't an added expense. This amount was compounded with a percentage which amounts to more and was added to his bonus at the end of the year. Don't remember the intimate details since it was so long ago, but that was why everyone was pissed. I see why he does it, but don't call it a ""bonus"". Just call it was it is: a cash advance from the next paycheck so I (the GM) can pinch a few pennies and make even more money. After that, I was kind of discouraged and understood why barely anyone wanted to work hard. They just wanted to punch a clock and go home. I'm not bitching about not getting a bonus, just don't call it that or phrase it to where new employees get excited. Used the gift card to buy a Xbox 360 internet connection thing, which broke in about a week. So yeah, complete waste.",2019-12-12 19:01:34
Never work with children or animals?+,6,e5q450,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/e5q450/never_work_with_children_or_animals/,1,1575416905.0,"Obligatory apology for mobile posting. I haven't posted in a while so this is going to be a monster. Theres a conclusion at the end of each story.

Disclaimer: the fact that I don't have children or pets shouldn't matter here, but I know people are going to ask so let's put that out there now: I have no children, furry or otherwise. This does not have any influence on my opinion. If I had children or pets, I would think/feel the same way. Some of these stories are from the laser clinic, some are from my new job, which is at a nail salon, since I am also a trained nail technician. 

One of my biggest pet peeves is bringing your very young child/any age pet into a salon/spa/cosmetic clinic. 5 times out of ten it's going to be fine, if kiddo is well behaved and sits quietly/sleeps in a pram then it's all gravy, but these are the instances where I think that parents should probably find someone to look after their kid during a treatment. Pets should not be in there full stop. Apart from service dogs. You do not need to bring your fur baby into a salon unless it's a service animal, which is going to be trained to behave a certain way. Anyway, on to the stories.

[i]Story 1[/i] (laser clinic) 
client comes in for microdermabrasion (30min treatment) and brings her daughter with her. I think she's about 5ish. Anyway, I give kiddo some markers and blank paper in the hopes that it'll keep her entertained while I'm working. We can't leave her out in reception because it's a glass front store, literally anyone can look in and casually stroll in, and this clinic didn't have a designated receptionist (therapists did the reception work between clients unless the manager was there) so there was no one out front to keep an eye on her. Anyway, the markers and paper distracted her for a grand total of five minutes before she got bored and came over to the treatment area, where I'm sitting down at eye level with kiddo and working on client, who is lying down. Client can't talk much when I'm working around her mouth, lest she end up accidentally eating a tiny vacuum, so kiddo turns to me. Now, I have all the maternal instinct of a brick, and I have no idea how to talk to anyone under the age of about 15, so I'm not sure what to do here. 

Kid starts playing with my necklace, which is a small pendant shaped like a gecko. Client tells her to stop, which is pointedly ignored, and kid is happily playing with my necklace and making it ""eat"" the tattoo on my collarbone (autumn leaves). I wasn't sure if I should pry my necklace out of kids hands or tell her to stop myself, because I wasn't sure if that would piss her mother off, so I had to keep going any pray she didn't break it or get tangled and hurt herself. 30 minutes feels like 30 hours when you're trying to work with a kid in your face. We got through it anyway, client is acting like nothing happened so I laugh it off later with one of my colleagues, who admitted that she would have had less patience, despite having a kid the same age.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] treatments are boring. There was a creche that does an hour of free childcare for shoppers literally a few doors away from this place. There was no excuse for that.

[i]Story 2[/i] (laser clinic): 
so when you have a laser treatment done, anyone in the room has to wear goggles for safety. Another parent brings a kid with her, this time a two year old in a pram. Colleague is working on her. Again, can't leave a toddler alone in reception. Colleague tries to put goggles on kiddo to protect their eyes. Nope, kiddo fires them across the room. Client can't make the kid wear the goggles, so colleague comes up with a compromise: turn kiddo towards the wall opposite the laser, put up rain hood thingy on the pram. Parent does not give this kid any forms of entertainment. 

Now, looking at a blank wall is boring for adults, let alone for kids. Especially when they don't understand why they're facing a wall. So kiddo is NOT. HAPPY. Of course, he starts screaming. It starts off as ""I am angry and I am letting you know"" screaming. Now, I get it. Looking at a blank wall is not fun. And kids scream. It's a thing that happens. I'm not going to judge a kid for screaming. What I am going to judge is the parent deciding she wants another, longer treatment than what she had booked in for, and insisting on having it done there and then. With her kid screaming at a blank wall. Colleague ends up stuck in a treatment room for an hour and a half with a kid who started off angry-screaming, and then progressed to ""I am not only angry, but I am also bored and fed up and I want to get out of here, so I'm going to scream as loud as I can just for the hell of it""

I was two rooms away and my own client and I could hear this kid as if he was in the room with us. We're pretty sure people outside the clinic could hear it. My client was distracted, concerned and slightly disapproving. Colleague needed a break after that treatment because her ears were ringing. That's how loud this kid was. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b] if you're going to be in a salon/spa for longer than five minutes, please find someone to look after your kid. If you can afford elective cosmetic laser treatments, you can afford a babysitter. 

[i]Story 3[/i] (nail salon): 
a group booking comes in with a baby (not quite a newborn but less than a year) in tow. They're all laughing and happy and have booked in for both manicure and pedicure, meaning they're going to be there for at least an hour. Instead of leaving the newborn in the pram, they insist on passing baby between them during their pedicures, which means they won't. Stop. Moving. At one point, I am asked to pass baby from one client to the other, since they can't stand up. I have only ever held a baby once or twice in my life. So I awkwardly hold him under his arms the way they showed me, kept him at arms length for the short distance (about two feet) and passed baby from one client to the other. Grandma is giving me the evils as if she expected me to be honoured to be holding a stranger's baby, and be all gushy over it. I was disappointing in this regard. Pedicures finish and all clients are brought to manicure stations to work on the hands. 

At this point, kiddo is getting fussy. Mother attempts to breastfeed while getting a manicure and it promptly comes back up, so he's clearly not hungry. He's just bored. Grandma (my client) suggests stopping her manicure halfway through so she can look after kiddo while mammy gets pampered. Mammy does not want to do this. I need them to make a decision before I start painting, because if she stops me halfway through I'll just need to take it off again so she doesn't get nail enamel on kiddo and his clothes. In the end, one of my colleagues who had some free time takes kiddo from grateful mother and walks around the salon with him, rocking him a bit. Kiddo is surprisingly unfazed by this total stranger holding him like one of her own and singing nursery songs in vietnamese. He looks a little confused, but he's not kicking up much of a fuss. Clients are all gushy about how good with him she is. They don't notice that all of the working nail techs are quietly judging them for turning one of our highly experienced techs into an unpaid babysitter. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b] don't try to breastfeed while getting a manicure. Find someone qualified to look after your baby while getting a manicure. Because if something happens to your little darling while in the salon, in the arms of a stranger, we're all up shit creek without a paddle. If grandma is offering to look after baby, let her. She clearly doesn't mind. 

[i]Story 4:[/i] (nail salon) 
Client comes in for a mani/pedi with her kid, who tells me she's 9. Both of them are having treatment. Now, I have my own personal, moral and ethical reservations about using gel polishes on anyone under the age of 17, but since mother has given consent and we don't have a minimum age limit, I had to go ahead and do the thing.

Kid is clinging to a baby doll the entire time. She's fiddling with it during pedicure, and it's in her lap during manicure. While I'm prepping her nails, she insists she wants black. Mother doesn't want her to get black, because it's too mature. I keep my lip firmly zipped, but look at mam for permission at every step. Kiddo eventually browbeats her mother into letting her get black, the compromise is that she gets black regular polish on her toes and white gels on her hands. Kid isn't as delighted as she could be, but everyone leaves relatively happy, and my opinions on kids with gels doesn't change.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] if your kid is young enough to insist on carrying a baby doll around with them, they're probably too young for gels. This is partly my own opinion, but also gels can be quite damaging, especially if not looked after properly, and I have my doubts as to whether a kid would look after them. Also if you don't want your kid to have something, I feel like you should hold firm rather than letting them talk you into it anyway. This seems like a bad idea. Might be my lack of personal experience talking here.

[i]Story 5:[/i] (nail salon)
Client comes in with a dog on a leash. It is a very cute, very small dog. I ignore it during the greetings and nearly hit the ceiling when it starts licking the exposed part of my foot without me noticing it had come over (I was wearing ballet pumps). client apologizes, I bring her over to the pedicure station, where dog promptly hops up onto the recliner. I ask her to put dog down and she obliges, only for it to hop onto the chair next to the pedicure recliner and curl up on the clean towels we leave out for use on clients. Again, she moves dog, this time onto the recliner with her. I have my reservations about this, but assume dog is trained enough to keep quiet and not pee/poop where it shouldn't, despite it looking pretty young. I'm silently praying theres no potty trouble as I continue with treatment. 

Treatment otherwise goes without a hitch, dog stays quiet, and I chat with client about the dog. It apparently cost her 2000(?!) to purchase this dog, and I goggle at the amount spent on a dog when you could adopt from a shelter. I didn't point this out aloud, but I did marvel at it with my colleagues later. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b] ok, if I spent that much money on a dog, I'd probably take it everywhere too. But seriously, if you can afford to drop that much for a dog, you can also probably afford doggy daycare. Or something. Or a dog is (hopefully) not going to drop dead or destroy the house/back yard if you leave it alone for an hour while you get a pedicure. Again, this might be inexperience with dogs talking. I don't know. What I do know is that we had to wash the towels, pillow covers and wipe down the recliner after the client left. Because if someone allergic to dog hair came in later and had a reaction, we'd be up shit creek again.

I work at a small gas station that is open 24 hours.  I get the night shift where we have a 2 person system for all shifts. My coworker is from the Philippines, really nice and friendly guy to work with.  I, on the other hand am a really white native man who is friendly and shy but I get really mad when people start making racist comments about others. 

Karen- k,  coworker- cw,  2 tons of fun- me

As me and cw are taking a break,  cw was having a snack and i was checking the price of some food i plan on ordering from the store ( the owners let us order stuff through the supplier for the order price) when ""it"" walked in. 

She looked like she hadn't showered in weeks and is well known around the town for being an nasty person to everyone that's not ""the same skin color ""as her. When k walks in, she b-lines for the till and asks for 3 packs of smokes.

I put my phone down before she gets to the till and i repeat the kind of smokes she wants to make i get the right ones.  She confirms them and i scan them, $40 and she pays.  She then asks for some matches. This is where shit not only hit the fan but hit the factory.

Me: I'm sorry, but we are currently out of matches.

K stood there for 4 seconds and it began: you people are the rudest fucking store in this fucking town.   You hire all these stupid fucking Filipinos that come in and steal all the jobs-

Me: I'm going to ask you leave or I'll be forced to call the police.

K: go ahead and call them you fat fucking cunt.

Me who had enough of this kind of bs for 1 week: get out

K sees I'm not bsing about the cops starts to leave but not without yelling more about us hiring fucking Filipinos and that we're a bunch of fags and n-words lovers and she will never come back as long as we have people from the philippines working here.

I had to yell at her to get lost or get arrested for racial discrimination.

K finally walks away yelling: fuck you, you n-word lover

In the end we didn't call the cops cause it wasn't worth the time.  We sat there for a few minutes making fun of her.",2019-11-24 11:28:13

I went out to interview some of those involved with the new legislation and had a few ""interesting"" people contact me when the story ran. One of them was a young man, just turned 18, who wanted me to look into the laws in his area because he was in love with his neighbour's pony.

This turned into a long conversation, first by email,  then by phone and, finally, in person when I went out to interview him. I swear he seemed entirely normal, aside from his social anxiety being cranked up to 10+. He simply couldn't relate to other humans due to his extreme awkwardness so he turned to animals for companionship, and he inevitably fell in love. It was sad -- he was a sweet, albeit completely unsophisticated, young fella, and his feelings for his neighbour's pony skeeved me out. It was just...*creepy*...knowing he was enamoured of an *animal*. 

I couldn't wait to leave and I told my boss I wanted to kill the piece. The other person who'd written to me had ""married"" his own pony in a Wiccan ritual and he'd insisted they had a nice, normal family with his human kids. Gah! I had no interest in becoming a magnet for these people. I'm a firm believer in letting others live as they will as long as they don't hurt anyone, and I do my best not to judge because God knows, I'm **far** from perfect; but I can't wrap my head around some things, this being one.",2019-11-13 08:31:12
Corporate incompetence will cost them for no reason,80,dokldm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/dokldm/corporate_incompetence_will_cost_them_for_no/,6,1572321241.0,"So my wife works in a clean room. We got married last February and were planning to try for a kid pretty much immediately. As part of labor laws employers have to make accommodations for pregnant women, so she told her boss that they should order a maternity clean room suit. The response back was, you won't need that. They probably thought this because the average woman who works there is 4'11 and rail thin. So even when they were pregnant they didn't really need a maternity suit. But my wife is 5'8 and definitely would. 

So we get pregnant in May, and she reminds them. But they still don't do anything. She reminds them again in August, but they didn't decide to start ordering it until September when they realize that she will actually need it because she's breaking more than half the clean room protocols fitting into a suit however many sizes big that will fit her stomach. They found out today that they need to order the suit be modified with special cloth from a local tailor, and it will cost thousands of dollars. The kicker, it won't be done until late February, and our baby is due in January. 

So they are spending thousands of dollars on a suit that she will never wear cause she'll give birth before it arrives. And they have to according to law.

Don’t small talk with your tattoo artist 2,80,dez5tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/dez5tx/dont_small_talk_with_your_tattoo_artist_2/,12,1570537173.0,"So since you guys enjoyed the first story I thought I’d tell another one. This one will make your blood boil tho and needs some context: in the country where I live (Belgium), some people may have some financial and social help from an organism called CPAS. Basically they get money if they don’t have a job and/or can’t support themselves and their family. Those people are usually seen as lazy people profiting off of the system and while I don’t think everyone benefiting from it fit this stereotype, this client definitely did.
So this woman comes in and she’s pretty nice at first. My mentor loves to small talk so Client starts telling us how she’s coming back from a 7 weeks holiday in Italy. Sure it’s pretty nice for her until we realize she’s profiting off of CPAS so she’s using the money she gets for leisure instead of, idk, rent and groceries? So me, Mentor and the other tattoo artist already know we’re having a stereotype as a client today.
Anyway, Client starts saying how she’s not ashamed to say she lives off of CPAS and she’s depriving herself because she has little money and I’m thinking « well you still could pay for 7 fucking weeks in Italy but sure, you deprive yourself » but I don’t say anything. 
After that, one of her friends comes to keep her company and this woman is just disgusting. She looked like Jabba the Hut with the most disgusting teeth I’ve ever seen. Of course, she too profit from CPAS. She doesn’t speak much and Client basically does all the talking, but Friend REEKS. As I got up to watch my Mentor tattooing, I smelled the strongest, grossest smell of literal shit. It was so bad I just couldn’t stand staying there and had to pretend I wanted to go outside to smoke so I could breathe.
When I come back, Client is telling Mentor how she loves to buy Disney shoes and how expensive they are and then again, with what money? Didn’t you say you deprive yourself? She has a kid so she also gets familial allocations, without working, and she’s able to treat herself to long ass holidays, expensive shoes and tattoos. Meanwhile, me and Other tattoo artist have to work our ass off to make some money and we barely can live with what we make, but can’t get any CPAS help. Fucked up system for sure.
But all of this doesn’t matter, cause what she told us after is what made me go M A D.
Client starts telling us how one day, her cat came back with a very bad injury: it got shot in the face and had a 2€ coin sized hole inside its cheek. She starts going on a rant because she wanted to post pictures on Facebook to, I guess, tell people she’s gonna kill whoever did that to her cat, and she’s ranting because Facebook blurred her nasty ass pictures of the cat’s very graphic injury. 
Again, I don’t say anything, but I’m thinking « well duh, of course they censor such graphic content, I wouldn’t want to see that shit ». After going on and on and on about how it’s « so unfair », Mentor asks her if she brought her cat to the vet. She says she didn’t, cause she cleaned up the wound and it seemed fine. ??? Okay ??? Mentor then says the vet could have at least give it some painkillers and Client just says « oh it didn’t hurt ». At this point I couldn’t take it any more and just said « what, did it tell you? » Mentor gave me the « keep calm » look but I know she agreed with me. Client didn’t react and we just talked about something else.
I was so mad after she left, we all were. What a piece of shit kind of human she was. She’s spending all the money she made not working at all on trivial shit but couldn’t pay for her badly injured cat. People like this just make me wanna puke...

"""This Place Is My Second Family""",54,dcthkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/dcthkk/this_place_is_my_second_family/,18,1570121029.0,"My new workplace has a very social, very extroverted ""second family"" vibe that I find smothering, especially as a non-exempt employee. 

Coworkers and managers do a tremendous amount of sharing and socializing. There's group meditation mornings, daily radio contest texting, music sharing Fridays and bimonthly Tupperware-selling parties. 
 
They tell me about therapy sessions, life coaches, abusive stepparents, a former employee's suicide (the cause of which was likely just to get some fucking peace and quiet). Not a day goes by that someone doesn't empty their emotional purse all over my desk.

Every single morning begins with at least six people sending mass ""Good morning!"" emails back and forth, and at least three people stopping by every office to say it personally.

I'm included on 10 p.m. group texts from my boss who occasionally travels telling us when she's arrived somewhere safely, along with the subsequent dozen replies of ""Good! I was so worried!"", ""Have fun!"", ""Safe travels!"", etc.; late night group texts about someone's sick relative with constant updates (""We're still waiting to see the doctor"", ""They're bringing us in now"", ""They said they're going to run some tests"") and subsequent condolences (""I'm praying for him!"", ""God has a purpose for all things HE IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!11"").

Last month, the finance director had everyone sign a get well card for her boyfriend. We'd only ever met him once, briefly, when she took him from office to office and introduced him to everyone. 

But that's the norm here. During my first week, I was asked to sign a retirement card for someone I'd only known for three days, and to sign a birthday card for a colleague in a different branch that I hadn't yet met and wouldn't for months. 

I am the only employee here who has not introduced any friends or family members to the managers and staff. I've met their friends (not work-related), daughters, sons, grandsons, husbands, fiancés and boyfriends. 

They're constantly looking for any excuse for us to spend time together outside of work. We're often expected to dine out to raise money for the organization (the restaurant agrees to give up a certain percentage of the evening's profits -- though it never yields much). We pay for ourselves and dine shoulder-to-shoulder with our bosses and coworkers and their spouses, boyfriends, children and friends. 

Sometimes they just try to get us all to order lunch from the same place -- which sounds fine, until you learn that the only socially acceptable place to eat it is in the windowless conference room with everyone else. 

Although I'd like to keep my family out of my workplace, it's difficult as I've come to learn that the standard practice here is to call a person's emergency contact whenever they're late or missing (or have filled out all the proper paperwork to be absent but their manager lost it!).",2019-10-03 19:43:49
Issues with my new job.,27,dc06fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/dc06fs/issues_with_my_new_job/,2,1569965376.0,"I’ve worked in the parts department of a new car dealer as a parts specialist. This is a step up from previous jobs so while I’ve been here since March I’m still learning. The manager and assistant manager show you things and kinda let you figure it out, there’s no solid training program. This doesn’t apply just to me but the handful of people who have been hired since I started. We hired a new driver a few weeks ago, he drove for a Napa previously so not oblivious but not fully up to speed. They just send the guy out and that’s it. No real on the job training. One day I took it upon myself to come up with a training program because I used to be a driver and was pretty good at it. I think it ended up in the trash and when they hired this new guy I offered to show him some stuff and was told no. 

As I said earlier, you get shown some stuff and are left to figure it out. Not really an issue to me as I can kinda pick stuff up quickly especially if I’m doing it fairly often. It’s when I’m shown something and I may do it a few times over a few months. You forget stuff. The assistant manager acts like you’re an idiot and will talk down to you. In my opinion the guys a bit of an incel. He’s 45, lives in the service managers house and thinks he’s a know it all because he’s basically memorized the whole parts catalog. He also gets upset if you bust his chops too much. So right now he’s pissed at me because I’ve made a few mistakes and I’ve been breaking his balls too much. 

The manager hired back a girl that worked here prior to me. We have the same job title but without a doubt I do twice the work she does. 

I don’t hate my job, I enjoy coming to work generally but lately it sucks. It’s still better than my last job but that’s a story for another day.",2019-10-02 00:29:36
"How a tiny cost saving experiment cost a company over £115,000 of whiskey",148,db5f8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/db5f8b/how_a_tiny_cost_saving_experiment_cost_a_company/,7,1569812214.0,"So this happened a few years ago at a company which I didn’t work at, but I worked next to. I spoke with the factory staff mostly during coffee breaks in the communal loading bay.

The company manufactured various ceramics, from plates and mugs to more specialty orders like whiskey bottles and commemorative plaques.

They had been in talks with a BIG whiskey company in Scotland for several months to manufacture 250,000 ceramic whiskey bottles over the next 5 years. I regularly chatted with the guys from the factory floor and some of them had been in the ceramic industry since they’d left school and what they didn’t know about ceramics wasn’t worth knowing.

Anyway, after the whiskey company was satisfied that they could handle the volume of over 1,000 bottles a week, and their quality standards, the final hurdle came down to the price.

I don’t know the exact numbers, but they ended up arguing over ‘a few pence’ on each one.

Eventually, the order came through and the first batch went into production, but the guys on the factory floor weren’t happy. They explained to me that in order to make the ‘slip’ (the ceramic liquid) cheaper, they were told to use less of one expensive ingredient and substitute it with something cheaper. The whiskey company was completely aware of this change, as this was all part of the cost saving measure. The mould for the whiskey bottle was thickened to compensate for the slightly weaker ceramic ‘slip’.

So the first 1,000 bottles were delivered to the customer successfully and the bottling process began. Meanwhile, the ceramics factory ramped up production to around 1,200 a week in order to maintain an overstock to ensure they wouldn’t incur a penalty should delivery deadlines be missed due to potential production or supply issues.

Again, the factory staff weren’t entirely happy with the product quality, but they were very pleased with the practically unlimited overtime they could pick up.

About a month passes and I hear some awful news from one of the factory staff.

The whiskey company completed their first bottling operation using the new ceramic bottles, but once they’d been filled up and moved around with a fork lift truck, the bottoms were breaking open on practically every single one.
Worse still, this was only discovered after all 1,000 had been filled with whiskey.

Production of the bottles was immediately stopped so that the cause of the problem could be determined. They even went as far as sending the bottles to be X-rayed to check their structural integrity.
Eventually, it was discovered that even though the thickness of the ceramic had been increased, this wasn’t enough to stop the bottom from ‘falling out’ after it was filled with whiskey and then moved with a fork lift truck once it was boxed and palletised.

So these were expensive bottles of whiskey which would go on to retail for over £100 a bottle, and practically all of the 1,000 bottles from the first bottling were now leaking their precious contents across the whiskey warehouse!

The following week, two large skips (dumpsters) arrived at the ceramics factory and the staff were ordered to smash and dump every single one of the 2,500 whiskey bottles which were still in the factory in various stages of production. Some were unglazed and straight out of the moulds, and others were completed with glaze, artwork and stickers. 

I went outside, purely out of morbid curiosity, to see pallet after pallet of empty whiskey bottles being taken outside and each one smashed by hand with a hammer into the skip.

I saw first hand what had gone wrong with the bottles. The finished bottle looked flawless, but even the gentlest tap with a hammer and the whole bottom just fell out as if it was made of egg shell. 
I know that hitting a ceramic bottle with a hammer sounds like a harsh test, but these were thick, heavy ceramic bottles which weighed about 2 pounds when they were empty! And yet the bottom of each one shattered like a thick egg shell.

A few days later, production on the whiskey bottles started again using the original (slightly more expensive) design. I was told that the product liability insurance claim was in the region of £115,000. Most of this was paid to the whiskey company for the lost whiskey, but some was being paid to the ceramics company for the raw cost of the lost materials they’d had to dump in the skip.


The lesson here is not to be clever and try to save a few pennies on a vessel which will hold £100 worth of whiskey!",2019-09-30 05:56:54
Don’t small talk with your tattoo artist,69,da6vsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/da6vsw/dont_small_talk_with_your_tattoo_artist/,9,1569619884.0,"I just started an apprenticeship in a tattoo studio about three months ago, but this story took place literally two weeks after I started and it’s probably the craziest I heard. My mentor is very chatty and likes to small talk with her clients, so they don’t think to much about their pain or whatever. I’m more on the quiet side and would rather watch and, most of all, listen.
So that day, her client was the cousin of her cousin, so they knew each other. And the woman (let’s call her C) comes in with a dude (D) who’s very obviously older than her. So my mentor (M) starts chit chatting and talks about tattoos while getting her stuff ready. C says her next tattoo will be a couple tattoo with D, and M asks how long they have been together - about one month. I don’t say anything cause it’s not my place to judge but damn, that 20 something is dating a 40 ish dude for a month and already thinks about getting a couples tattoo? I brushed it off cause I don’t really care, it’s not my body after all.
So they keep chatting while M starts tattooing C, D next to us, and C is super annoying. She can’t stop moving around (which is really not recommended when you get inked FOR LIFE)  and is super excited and talkative. After a while, M ask « so how did you two meet? » and C’s face gets all red and she just says « you don’t know him? » so D and M look at each other and they’re both like « I don’t think so... » and that’s when C drops the bomb: « it’s dad’s cousin ». 
I can’t begin to explain how much effort I had to make to keep a straight face cause all the muscles in my face just couldn’t take this info. If I had to say something in this moment, I would have just burst out laughing like a maniac. But M kept her cool very well and the rest of the session was very quiet.
About two days later, I talk about that with M and laugh all I want when M tells me that her dad (so D’s cousin) DIED about a month and a half ago... making me think that they probably met at the funeral.
I haven’t heard back from that girl yet but I sincerely hope she realized how fucked up it is to date your dead dad’s 20 years older than you cousin.
I have a lot more crazy client stories if you want to read more, but this one is definitely the most fucked up I heard so far.",2019-09-28 00:31:24

Another organization's employee talks down to me because I'm young maybe?,49,d0h3gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/d0h3gs/another_organizations_employee_talks_down_to_me/,3,1567778656.0,"A little backstory. I work as an advocate at a domestic and sexual violence program. One thing that we do if we don't have shelter space is write a letter to our town's economic services (run by the state) asking for an emergency motel stay for clients who are fleeing. Not sure how it works in other states, but we have emergency motel stays for homeless folks in certain categories or during extreme weather, and fleeing domestic/sexual violence is one of those categories.

Anyways, on to the story. It was 3:45pm, and my coworker and I were accompanying a client and her three young children (I think the ages were around 1, 5, and 8) to economic services. We accepted the family into our shelter, but we did not expect the room to be ready for occupancy until the next day, so we had decided to ask for a motel stay for the night. The economic services building is set up with a lobby and front desk area, and a doorway that leads to the back offices. These kids were ROWDY. Mom was trying to fill out paperwork and my coworker and I were telling them to stop running around, chasing each other, climbing on stuff, etc. but obviously they weren't gonna listen to us. Mom was able to periodically tell them to stop, which worked temporarily, but she was preoccupied with, you know, getting shelter for the night.

Another thing to mention is that the economic services office is supposed to close at 4:30, so they said we might have to call the after hours emergency shelter hotline, which would have been fine, but they decided to help the client anyway.

My coworker and I had both been in since 8am and had already resigned ourselves to staying late at this point, so once one of the workers was able to bring the family into the back offices to finish the process, I decided to stay in the waiting room so I could make a couple calls to other clients that I did not get to do earlier. It was nearly 4:30 at this point.

I picked up a few things around the lobby that the kids had strewn about, and then started looking for those client numbers on my phone. The front desk worker, who I had ZERO issues with during my other times interacting with her, starts picking up a few things as well, and then comes up to me about how out of control those kids were.

""I have known this family for years and have seen them in a lot of different situations, but I have NEVER seen those kids act like that"" and talks about how she's seen people come in here who are dying or in terrible situations and has never seen anything like that. It very much seemed like she was looking for an explanation from us, or was maybe blaming us? I have no idea.

I empathize with that, and of course acknowledge that these kids are going through a hard time as well. At this point I'm a little confused, because I'm not entirely sure where she's going with this.

She then begins asking what sort of resources my organization has for child care, commenting on how hectic everything has been since the family got there. I explained that we don't have babysitters or childcare on staff, unfortunately. She then goes on about how she'd like to have a meeting with our team to discuss what resources and programs we have for families so that she can better understand the services we can provided, etc. I am nodding along and saying, ""mhm"" to everything she says.

She stops, looks at me, and says in a voice absolutely dripping with sarcasm and condescension: ""Mhm. So do you wanna go back there with your CLIENT and COWORKER and help her watch those kids?""

I'm pretty socially anxious and get easily flustered during confrontations, but I give her the most sickly sweet smile I can muster, and say: ""ACTUALLY, I have to go make a couple calls to other clients, because my coworker and I were supposed to be gone half an hour ago.""

She then nods and says, ""Ah, I see, you're pulling double duty"" and goes back behind the desk. Uh, yeah lady, we ALL are. All the time. That's kind of the nature of this work.

I was fuming at this point, and it turns out she wasn't even able to stay at the economic services motel for various reasons, so I went back to shelter and stayed even later, busting ass to get that room ready. My boss was also there and I ranted to her about it, who then proceeded to say a bunch of thing she would have said to this woman, all of which I WISH I was able to say at the time.

I don't know if she thought I was a lazy millennial who wasn't doing my job because I was on my phone? I'm 24 and this woman is probably in her 40's, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was what she was thinking. I get that she was probably frustrated because she was supposed to be gone, but 1. We were supposed to be gone too, and 2. They had EVERY RIGHT to tell us to call the after hours hotline, and they decided not to. Not my problem, lady. Also, I. AM. NOT. A. BABYSITTER.

The silver lining to this story is that my boss got a call from the supervisor at Economic Services the following day and took the opportunity to tell her about the incident. She already knew about it. Apparently, another worker at Economic Services had witnessed the interaction and had complained about that particular employee. So hopefully she got a talking to, but at the very least I'm glad someone else saw that absolute bullshit.

Feel free to let me know if anything is unclear about this story, I know there's a lot of details.",2019-09-06 17:04:16

Sometimes, if one of the dogs has extra energy they need to burn off, my boss will have me walk the dog to my house and back (all the dogs get walked regularly; this is just an extra walksies for the more energetic dogs).

Yesterday, I took a terrier named Riley for one of these walks. Usually when I walk a dog down to my house, we just turn and go right back to the kennel, but this time I decided to walk him up the driveway to visit with my dog Jenny. Jenny's been lonely since her brother Jack passed away, so I thought a visit might be nice.

(I took all necessary precautions, seeing as I was introducing two strangers to each other. I won't get into all the specifics, just because that would take too long, but rest assured, both dogs were perfectly safe the entire time.)

Riley *LOVED* Jenny. Being a human, I don't know what dogs find attractive about other dogs, but boy dogs tend to ""like"" Jenny in an inappropriate manner, so I was very pleased to see that Riley just wanted to rub shoulders and sniff faces with my Jenny.

Whenever dogs play together, I like to imagine the conversation they're having. Jenny's a collie, so she's much bigger than Riley, who I imagine with a Scottish accent (I'm not sure what specific kind of terrier Riley is, but since Scottish terriers are a thing, I imagine all terriers with Scottish accents). When he saw her, his whole face lit up, as if to say *""Aye, yer a big, bonny lass, ain't ye?""* (I apologise to any actual Scots who happen to read this)

I let the two of them visit for about ten minutes before I took Riley back, and they both seemed very happy to have met.

When Riley got back to the kennel, he gave me a big slobbery kiss before settling into bed for a nice long nap.",2019-08-29 17:46:55

I have been a part time retail associate employee at a retail store since the beginning of the year.  I am also a college student and I live a half hour away from both school and work and i have a car. The first week the hiring manager, let’s call him Bob, scheduled me to work 3 days a week which was how many days I could work at first since I am in college. I worked for 5 hours each scheduled work day.  The next week Bob scheduled me to work 2 days and the third week, as well as working the same shift at the same exact time.  Then the 4th week he scheduled me to work 1 day for 4 hours but at the same shift.  When I checked to see what day I would be scheduled to work for the 5th week, i saw he didn't schedule me to work at all.  So I went on my personal day to ask him the reason as to why he was scheduling me less shifts.  His response was that my work performance was slacking, I need to work faster.  I am going as fast as I can, it’s not my fault so many customers come in and mess up what i just fixed. And besides, I was never told my work performance was slacking so how was I supposed to know.  

The 6th week I was scheduled to work 1 day but i couldn't go because I was involved in a minor accident that caused me to have to go to the hospital to get checked out and it was recommended by the doctor to not to go to work.  The 7th week, Bob scheduled me to work 2 days but reduced my hours to 4 hours instead of 5 hours but the same shift.  By then i asked him what the deal was and he said it depended on how much money he had each week. I even asked him if i could have more shifts, but he says i need to request it on a request slip in the break room.  I have requested every time nothing has changed.  

A few times he has called me up to work because they were low in staff and 1 day i had to take over another employees shift who works 8 hours and does the same job but more.  However the problem was he told me to do something that I did not hear him say and I didn't do it and i ended up getting scolded for not doing it. Apparently he told me over the phone what i had to do but i did not hear him say it because 1) he was talking very fast and 2) I have ADD and APD and i told him about it during the interview.  When i got there he did not remind me what i had to do and i got scolded after he realized I didn’t do the other work, but I was the only one on the floor in the department. I told him I did not hear him tell me to do it and I reminded him of my disorders but he wouldn’t listen to me.  After that he hasn’t scheduled me more than 1 shift.  The positive side though was that I was asked by a different manager to cover another employees shift who worked in a different department, I said I would do it and i did an excellent job.  

Sometimes when I am working, I am alone on the floor in my department because the other 2 employees are at the cash registers due to the long lines at the checkout line. So the merchandise says messed up because i have to do triple the work: assist customers, clean up the isles and do recovery.  There so many customers who ask questions and place the merchandise in the wrong section on the time,  it is just so stressful.    

I requested more hours but nothing has changed.  I need the money to pay for groceries, gas, pay my bills, college tuition because it has increased.   He is always scheduling me 2 different times, either 5 hours or 4 hours, but it is mostly 4 hours at only 1 day a week.  I am lucky if i get 2 days a week. I even have applied to other places but there are limited job opportunities where I live. 

So i am asking should i email HR about my problem or just deal with it and search for another job?",2019-08-23 01:49:36

Where I work we are also responsible for looking after the walk in customers (if it's chip or plexi, doing the job straight away, or getting them on the phone with booking team), doing pre-job inspections (to make sure we get them to sign of on preexisting damage, and inform them of what they need to know), as well as the actual job of whatever their car glass needs. 

Then we give them the car back, collect payment, do a ""show off"" where we show them our handiwork, let them know about our workmanship guarantee & curing time, and point out we cleaned their windows and vacuumed their car. This is ""customer delight"" part of our work. 

Earlier this week I had a woman shout for me for several minutes because she couldn't find our entrance. 

Today a guy shouted at me because of the rego pockets....

So we move the stickers over- warrant of fitness, service stickers, parking permits, and rego (vehicle licence aka road use fees). Most stickers we can cut off your old screen with a razor blade. Rego pockets aren't designed to be moved. Generally the break apart or don't stick. Basically any service place will give them to you for free if you ask nicely. 

Well this guy apparently wanted to retain the original one (it was Audi ones. Cause he has a 2007 Audi because he's soooo rich and fancy). Didn't want ours with our brand. 

Anyways, I didn't do his prejob. I didn't work on his car. I just happened to be the asshole that went to serve him when he walked into the reception area. 

I did try and explain the above. I did ask him politely to not shout at me. Both failed. So I opened the door into the workshop and shouted at the tech that worked on it

 ""BEN, THIS GUY WANTS HIS AUDI POCKETS. HE WON'T STOP SHOUTING AT ME""

Ben: ""BUT THEY BREAK WHEN THEY GET REMOVED""

me: ""I DON'T CARE. GIVE HIM HIS BROKEN AUDI POCKETS. IT'S WHAT HE WANTS.""

Then I walked away from reception back to my job. Given how the guy proceeded to treat Ben, hearing what an asshole he is didn't make him think twice. 

Ben came over after and told me about it. Turns out he managed to get one off in a reasonable shape (still scruffy, but mostly intact). He broke it on purpose as a ""fuck you"". Guy ended up going to audi to get new ones anyways. 

Anyways, what I don't understand is why people are not even a little bit hesitant to shout at a complete stranger that they've had no dealings with prior to shouting. What kind of people think that it is acceptable behaviour? Seriously, can anyone explain it to me?",2019-08-17 12:25:50
Company Demands i return after quitting just to cut me off,55,cr1es6,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/cr1es6/company_demands_i_return_after_quitting_just_to/,8,1565930260.0,"Whoa boy didn't think I'd be back here, before we get to what the title implies, I actually have a small update from my last post on here! The temp my family went through to get into that horrid position, actually was caught stealing money from peoples checks (we all did question why we all made different amounts for the same work hours) and the company i worked for, is the only one in the area still working with them, everyone else left, even docked their pay down 2$ an hour.  


Now back to what we're all here for, After dealing with the holy hell of the last job, i went and found an easy sounding job for a candy company, sounds great right? wrong. The company payed 12$ an hour, didn't bother me, but you could tell walking in that things were off. Now when you work with food or anything edible, from my knowledge, you're to have a clean room so to say, or an entirely sanitary room for employees to gown up and get ready. This company had a hallway into the workplace, where you'd put on a lab coat, beard guard, hairnet, gloves, ect. One catch though, this was all right next to the bathrooms which had no door blocking them off, so you're walking right by the bacteria filled washrooms as you're walking into an area where we melt chocolate, store nuts, the works. the one thing keeping the germs from contaminating things? A fan. Just a fan blowing down on you before you get to the melting room, Boss said it blew the germs off, at that point i didn't care, just needed money, but i was a bit worried about it.   


Now I'm in this job through a temp, what i didn't know about this place was that if you were a temp, you were treated like t r a s h. I'm talking all the main hires were sitting around doing nothing, as me , my mother, father and my fiance are busting ass for 12$ an hour while i stare at this machine operator doing nothing, we'll call him jim. Now jim was that arrogant dick who if you had a reason for you working slow would immediately make fun of you to other workers. and wouldn't you know it, i actually was working on a broken toe! (Long story short, ran into my chair due to tripping over fiance's clothes) And on my third day i actually had to leave early because i was in pain to the point of tears, didn't get pain meds for it because my doc is cracking down on junkies. So i went out and sat in the car waiting for my parents and fiance to get done, 6 am rolls around, here comes random people, and wouldn't you know it? Jim talking shit about my broken toe. I didn't make a scene, i kept working.  


Week 2 rolls around, I've been applying to many places during this whole scenario, Ended up getting a call back from this one place shipping phones, Set up an interview for a week later. the shift that night was the worst it could have possibly been. When working with food you have to clean machines of allergens when swapping product. And who was cleaning this possibly 20ftx18ftx25ft machine? 4 people, me and my family. Jim sat at the bottom of the damn thing flirting with this one girl, after this my family had enough, we walked down to the boss at the last 10 minutes of our shift and said we quit, She tried asking us to stay, explaining most of the bosses had been fired, blah blah blah. I didn't care, we ""thought it over"" aka just called the temp and said we left.   


Got a call one day later saying they wanted us back, this was a sunday, we went back, we worked our shift, easiest night out of them all. we come back on monday and what do you know? We're not on the list at the guard shack to get in and we're told to leave. We called the temp the next day and were told ""Your work was no longer wanted"" The boss that wanted us back was fired, and the entire place is just run by normal employees with a ""Manager"" tag on their shirt, no increase in pay, just authority.  


TLDR; Went to work for a candy company, got sick of their shit, Quit and got told to come back just to be fired.",2019-08-16 07:37:40

It was extremely unexpected, as she kept it very quiet and did not tell anyone why she was off work for so long due to illness. Her passing has upset me greatly, and what made it worse was today. 

Not even 24 hours after hearing the news, I am sitting at my desk and my S/O (who works in a different department) comes up to my floor to give me a hug and ask if I am ok. We speak for about 2 minutes, when my bitch of a manager comes stomping over, says to my S/O and I quote ""No relationships on the floor, off you go bye bye."" in the snarkiest way possible. This made my blood boil, how inconsiderate can you be especially after what happened yesterday. It ended with a little spat between my manager and my S/O, with my manager saying ""you are so rude, I am calling your manager.""

At the beginning of this month I started work as a trainee in a small travel business. During the interview the people I work with seemed very normal. 
They are not.
My instructor is already gone on vacation 2 days after I started, leaving me, you guessed it, without instructions.
Turns out, the coworker who is ""in charge"" of me now is a complete nutjob ( in a your-mom-kills-you-in-your-sleep-and-tells-the-cops-the-fairys-told-her-so way). 

First day we are alone in the office, she moans and complains about every customer. Every customer! Virgin Mary could have called and would have gotten a ""that fucking cunt"" after she hangs up.
People who spent a lot of money here are ""arrogant snobs"" the ones who go for cheap options are ""poor assholes"". She's spreading hate from the moment we open till we close. 
All day long she sighs, she whines, she whimpers whenever something has to be done. 
While I'm on the phone with a customer she yanks it out of my hand and takes the call cause I'm ""only a trainee"". 
Simple tasks (writing greeting cards, making coffee, taking notes, etc) she monitors like a hawk but then she leaves me taskless for hours because she ""doesn't have time"".

Lady, I know how to write a damn card, you even did give me a template for that!

Yesterday around 5pm s. o. from the office next door comes over to remind her that it was our turn to put the bins out this week. Neighbor was super nice and polite, didn't raise her voice at all. 
The second she's out my coworker flips. She screams, she shrieks, she almost cries ""that bitch, she's always picking at me, she's always yelling at me, it's YOUR fault, it's YOUR task, why didn't you do it??"" 

I'm so done and it's only day 5!!",2019-08-07 22:39:00
"Guy comes to the arcade I work at, expects us to give him special discounts and stuff for free",60,cmra1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/cmra1h/guy_comes_to_the_arcade_i_work_at_expects_us_to/,3,1565101692.0,"This guy came into my work last night, an arcade, 2 hours before be close with 2 kids (both around 12-13). They both had cards from one of the two other locations, which dont work with ours. We are able to transfer everything to one of our cards, but only if we call the other arcade. Then, if you wanted to go back to the other one they would have to do the same thing to get everything back onto the original cards.

He started asking about deals we have that include go-karts. The only thing that interested him was a wristband that was supposed to be for 3 hours. We have to end these wristbands 30 minutes before we close, so he was only going to get an hour and a half. That's so the guys working outside wont be stuck here for an extra half hour to an hour after we close, trying to close everything.


He asked if he could get a discount, which I understand wanting since you're not getting the full time, but we dont offer these types of discounts. They are available all day, he could have come in an hour earlier to get eh full 3 hours. He started getting upset.

He then bought 2, one for each kid. Then, he proceeded to stand there and aks if I could give him a free one for him. No? You dont go to a movie theater buy a ticket and ask for a free one. He then said that ""maybe he should talk to my manager"". I told him ""I am more than willing to get her, but I cant give you a free wristband"". He angrily walked away.

Near the end of the day they finished and were chasing in their tickets. Now, I admit the prize prices aren't very good but i still have to enforce them. When people cash tickets in i have to scan the item so that specific amount of tickets is taken from the card. 

The one girl had around 100 tickets, and proceeded to try asking for 2 of an item that was 120 each. She cant afford that, which I inform her and I start directing her towards the stuff that is in her price range. The man immediately steps in and starts saying ""really"" over and over in an annoyed tone, then again mentions talking to my manager. After they finished cashing their tickets in the man said ""we're just going to keep going to x-location. They're much nicer there""

1. I dont control prices, deals/specials, or anything else along those lines. If you don't like anything like that you can ask the manager for the GM's number and talk with him about it, but I have literally no control over any of those things.

2. Along the same line, I dont control prizes or prices for those prizes. The prices are set, you can see them before even asking for the item. I cant scan a different item and give you it for the lower price. That's theft and I can and will get fired for it, and even possibly have the cops called. Not worth it.

3. The other locations are still owned by the same guy, so in the long run you are still giving him money by going to the other location.

TLDR: some guy buys some wristbands for the arcade I work, gets upset that I cant offer him discounts on it and wont give him an extra one for free. He then proceeds to get upset, later into the night, about the ticket to prize prices. Both times he says that he should talk to my manager.",2019-08-06 17:28:12
Why I quit my former job.,41,cifsdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/cifsdh/why_i_quit_my_former_job/,1,1564221934.0,"This is my first post on reddit. I don't know if this is the right place but be free to correct me otherwise. English isn't my first language but I hope you'll get the idea anyhow.

Back in 2011, I had just finished my first year of university and felt that it simply wasn't for me and thus I started looking for work. I had just gotten my first car and I was excited to get some work experience. At this time, I was 19 years old, kinda small at only 164 cm (5'4 feet) and I've been growing up with Binder's syndrome, a syndrome that means that I had underdeveloped nose and jaw structures and even though I had surgeries for both when I was 18, my nose spine is still kinda flat. I'm also very timid and don't like confrontations. This comes into play later.

I came into contact with a work that was similar to those door knacking jobs although this was more that you had already decided a time to do a demostration of the machine that we were selling. We were selling some sort of cleaning machine with the base cost of 3700€ with extra additions adding up to 4200€. You did get paid for every demostration you went to and got a bonus for every machine that you sold. In hindsight, I'm glad that I left them fairly early considering some dirty tricks they were doing, like letting the costumers test the machine right after it being sold so that a refund couldn't be cashed in.

Doing the two months I was hired, I only sold two machines, one to my parents and one to my aunt. Considering the fact that I'm from a very small village of 400 and the next town only have a couple thousand living there, it's no wonder that the machine didn't really get sold because in the end, who would spend 4000€ on what is essentially is just a vacuum cleaner and window cleaner? The machine was also a big pain to clean considering that it didn't used vacuum bags but was water based it needed cleaning after every usage of it.

My desire to quit the job was after I had been doing another demo of the machine for some friends of my father. I didn't get it sold here either so my boss were calling me up and started questioning me why I didn't get any machines sold. Out of no where, he them said: ""Maybe it's because of your disease?"" Excuse me, what? Just because my nose is looking weird does it not qualifies as a disease! I was however too timid to question against his words. I went home that night crying and the next monday, I handed in my notice and quit the job.

I know that this is pretty tame compared to other stories but I got reminded of this recently and felt like venting it out in this post.",2019-07-27 13:05:34

I and my co-workers all get paid minimum + tips. TLDR at bottom

So yesterday I show up at 2PM to see my coworker ""L"" who opened the store all by herself (normal) and had been there since 9AM helping customers at the register. She looks super tired and sad as she looks up at the door chime to see who came in. Her face lit up with a smile when she saw it was just me. fast forward an hour or so and L has been able to finish all her work while I helped customers up front. So now L just has to help customers with me until she leaves at 5PM. We chat and I find out she had worked 5PM to 2:30AM the previous day, got home, only got a few hours sleep and showed up on time this morning at 9AM.   
L was tired and just wanted to go home and go to bed, and it showed. She was NOT rude, snobby, or otherwise unpleasant to me OR customers during her shift. However this one couple thought otherwise I guess.  


ACTUAL STORY: There were no other customers behind this couple, so L and I helped them together. I helped the man with enthusiasm and a bright smile, chatting and making jokes, L helped the woman, only saying what needed to be said, but doing a great job and got the order correct. They were both nice and commented on how yummy their ice cream was. The man pays, but when he signs the receipt, the woman writes something on it before handing it back. I thank them for coming in and they head out the door. L sees the receipt first and asks me what they wrote. On the receipt is a thoroughly scratched out tip line, and ""cheer up L"" written beside it (we wear name tags). I brush it off as rude but whatever. However it was more like a final straw for L, as it really upset her and she needed to take a break in the back office for a while to calm down. All that did was make her day harder. it was not a courtesy or in anyway a nice thing to say to her.  


Leaving comments like that on your receipt is not okay, and can hurt people who are already having a really hard day. YOU stand on your feet for 15 hours with less than 5 hours of sleep and we'll see how cheery you are.  


TLDR: Coworker worked on feet for 15 hours with almost no sleep and got told to ""cheer up"" on receipt note left by customer, made her hard day even worse. NOT COOL.",2019-07-21 22:16:12

(I was only charging him $15 a week)

He agreed to do it last week, but his character on how he talked sent a lot of red flags. He legit asked my gay coworker ""Why are you gay"" My coworker replied back ""Why the fuck are you straight? The hell kind of question is that."" Like in a legit serious question straight face and everything. It was such an awkward encounter. He's also been lying to people about his living situation as well, I did some stalking and actually saw that he lives with his parents as he claimed to be living alone.

The guy legit got upset about the $15 as I confronted him about it, putting him on the spot and he refused to pay as well. I basically told him, man you don't understand why I'm charging you $15 a week, you eat / vape in my car, I take you to lunch, I drive you to work saving you 10 hours a week from bike riding. This is a luxury, you're not my fucking responsibility to see that you come to work.

Then he didn't bother showing up for work for 2 days and no call no show as well, just this week. He showed up on MON then missed TUE WED and showed up at my doorstep to go to work, without even saying good morning or hey to me. Today was probably the most awkward work encounter I ever had.

He told me it bugged him for 2 days and he didn't want to come in, then he finally agreed to pay for it today.

Told him, The dude, I don't want to be your friend and you're probably fired, because of this. Informing him in case if he wasn't fired that I wasn't going to give him rides anymore.

The guy lost his job as soon as I dropped him off, they called him about it while in my car.

I've had no problems and was loving my job. I was glad not to deal with rude customers. But a new warehouse had opened up and they needed help. We were told by one of the big bosses that things were getting messed up and they needed help. Our warehouses usually house about 60 people on a shift. They're huge!

 So we ended up moving warehouses a lot closer to home. First week there they seemed nice. I'm kinda the quiet type and we we're allowed to listen to music, so I tuned everything out. I met a girl there let's just call her A for privacy. Well A was kinda off putting. She came in that week upset over a conflict with her girlfriend. I consoled her said she was gonna be okay and that maybe she should go home. 

I ended up that week explaining to her that I was a transman I prefer male pronouns. That I'm also gay with a male fiancee. Putting everything up front in case she didn't like that stuff and if rather not be around co-workers who are biased against this. A started some small chat while I listened maybe quiped some of my own interests. The next two weeks I got moved across the warehouse to do a special job with my mother as we work together. 

After that job was finished and we awaited the next shipment I was sent back to my original work with A. Now this was at the end of the week I worked two days with A. I probably exchanged a few words over the two days with her. I come in this week and only talk to her yesterday over something that was messed up. I was fustrated because some stuff was being done wrong. (For a little back intro we price clothes) I refused to price anything wrong as I knew how to do this and was even offered a mentor position to teach new people how to price properly.

Today I came in and had a phone conversation with an HR manager. A had accused me of sexual harassment. I didn't get in trouble and was told this was just to help me. I was told I made sexual advances and had inappropriate conversation with A. I was very upset with this as I am a rape survivor. I had a panick attack afterwards and had to talk to my mother. We both agreed that we would move warehouses. Before this happened I had started to get mean looks and attitude. I believe she did this thinking I would get fired because she didn't like me.",2019-07-17 00:19:49

Yesterday morning, I’m on my back deck having a smoke. We recently had our toilet and dishwasher replaced where I live, and I noticed they were no longer on the back deck. Sweet, they took them away. There were some guys landscaping in back of the house, there’s a parking lot where the landlord keeps some equipment for his business and there’s some bushes/trees the workers were trimming back.

One of the guys comes up to me for a chat. Nice guy, Irish guy with a pretty thick accent, a little difficult to hear and understand over the sound of the blowers/weed whackers. We have a small conversation about the pot shops that opened up in my state, but when I go to the other side of the deck to hear him better, he warns me not to touch the railing on my deck. A weird tip, but I comply. He asks about the stuff that was replaced in my house, I explain yeah it was replaced like a month ago or so. 

The gentleman goes on to explain to me how when they hauled it away, there was a nice, ripe shit in it that proceeded to get all over the poor guy moving it and all over my deck before they had sprayed it off. I’m mortified by this point, but then the guy asks me if I’m the one who did it. Gave me a good laugh but man, I felt bad for the dude who had to move that thing! We both seemed to agree someone probably got drunk one night and thought it’d be funny, but honestly, you win this round, mystery shitter.",2019-07-10 17:20:24
He Denied Hitting My Car,75,c9yt0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c9yt0s/he_denied_hitting_my_car/,8,1562447896.0,"I worked in a lab for just shy of a year. There were a lot of issues from the beginning (paid with personal checks or under the table, bats in the lab, and the lab was a house), but I was paying for my Master degree so I needed that money. 

The first biggest incident that happened was that I didn’t tell the owners that Quicken Loans Quality Assurance team called. We got tons of telemarketer calls all the time (also tons of lawsuit calls, whole other story) and when I told them about those, they never cared. Finally, they say my call log book (they were so old fashion and made us hand write every call that we got) and started screaming at me that I was so stupid for not telling them. Mind you this, my other coworkers also got calls from them and either never documented it, or also never told them, but they were my friends and I didn’t want to throw them under the bus.

They would also constantly comment on how my female coworker and I looked. I was always miserable there so I never put in any effort toward looking good around them. The owner’s wife would always saying “You don’t look well...” every time she saw me. 

I knew I wasn’t gonna stay long so I bit my tongue for a lot of things. One day, I had my car parked in the driveway of the house. For some reason, something told me to go to the window that overlooked my car and my coworker followed. I watched as my boss drove into my car and then he didn’t bother to back away from it. The owners son was at the lab so I immediately confronted him about it. 

Son: “How do you know they hit your car?”

Me: “Because coworker and I just saw it...”

He runs downstairs and sees that the car is still touching mine and I hear him start yelling at his dad. The owners come upstairs and try to act like nothing happened and ask me about my day. I responded:

“I’m good, how is my car though?”

They were shocked that I knew so instead of the logical apology, they start joking that I had a foot long crack in my bumper. I told them the joke was highly inappropriate and they just walked away. In the grand picture, there was a tiny bump, so I didn’t ever quote them. If they had apologized, I would have been over it, but they never did. 

Cutting forward in time, I gave them a three month notice that I would be leaving in January. I told them to hire someone new so I could train them with my coworker before then. They thought that if they claimed they didn’t have time that they could guilt me into working longer. My last day came and they asked my coworker and I to stay. I repeatedly said no, even when they offered to give me a huge raise and promotion to manager. 

Owner’s Wife: “Well why don’t you want to stay?”

Me: “Honestly, I’m not treated well and what broke the camel’s back for me was when you ran into my car and didn’t apologize.”

The owner started SCREAMING at me that he never hit my car and how I was being stupid. My coworker started yelling too about how we all saw it and his son did too. Finally after a minute of him yelling, I actually yelled over him (super unprofessional, but I had enough). I explained that if he wanted to continue a yelling contest that I would win and how this was unprofessional in a work place. That shut him up real quick. His wife started crying saying how I was so unresponsible for not giving them a six month notice and then they started accusing me of lying with my results and lying about when I was there or not. I asked them why they wanted to keep me if they thought that of me and they were quiet. 

They tried calling me once or twice after that, but I never answered the phone. This was about a year or two ago. 

Jumping to this past week, I get a phone call from the owner. I immediately sent it to voicemail and messaged my coworkers. They were apparently trying to get out SSNs and were yelling at us when we refused to give it to them on the phone/in general. 

The entire family was full of miserable and disgusting people. The lab has a multitude of lawsuits against it and is currently under investigation from the FDA.

I have written before about my coworkers with their, should I say, interesting antics. For some exposition, see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bws9n6/blocking\_the\_choosing\_beggar\_coworker\_with\_a](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bws9n6/blocking_the_choosing_beggar_coworker_with_a) .

In that post, I featured a creature called **Brutus the Backstabber** only briefly. Such a low exposure would do injustice to his unforgettable character, so to rectify that, I've decided to give him the top billing in tonight's episode.

Brutus. Where to begin. I stand by my characterization of the previous post that paints him as ""a backtalking human replicant who not only hides knives into other people's backs but steals credit wherever he can.""

He was also my officemate, with a shitty modus operandi. Like an antlion waiting for prey, he would burrow deep under his noise canceling headphones and keep fingerdrumming the shit out of his desk. He was waiting for me to get comfortable in my coding zone. When he deemed the time ripe, he would slam the headphones on his desk with a bang that registered 11 on the Richter scale. This would be followed by him ~~asking for~~ relentlessly demanding help with work he damn well should have been capable of doing on his own and that was assigned to him alone. If contested, he would run to the boss he was friendliest with, complaining I was not being cooperative. If I acquiesced, he would:  
A) hear my advice, invariably scrap said advice and do things his own way, then  
B) blame me when the thing he coded his own way would not work.

Brutus also had a knack for ""challenging"" his coworkers (mostly me), picking apart their work, questioning the decisions they had made on their own software elements, that were no business of Brutus to mess with.

I'm not sure if I can paint an accurate enough picture of this fine gentleman. But if you've read Joseph Heller's [Catch-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22), You might remember Chaplain Tappman's ""assistant"" corporal Whitcomb, a hostile dickwad incarnate: a dead ringer for Brutus.

I don't know if he was gunning for my position, had it in for me for some reason or was just an all-around asshole.

Over time, Brutus got bolder. My officemate saw fit to challenge my work in the bi-weekly meetings in front of our managers and make suggestions what could be improved in my software module. His favorite boss had a raging hard-on for all these *suggestions*. Why not, they sounded impressive. A specialist (i.e. me) could see they also were wildly impractical, laborious to implement and questionable to support in the long run. Said boss liked to overrule my opinion as irrelevant. Yeah, what do I know. I've only programmed this module for the last five years.

Five years... The first two had been quite good, my superiors had trusted me back then. They had given me autonomy to do things the way I deemed best. After that, more people, especially more middle managers rolled in. More politics. Not long after that, enter Brutus. He wasn't the only suck-up/office politician that had entered our firm, but he was one of the most aggressive ones. He had a natural talent for it: Always ready with a question, always ready to *challenge*. The bosses seemed to love that. To play it safe, this textbook definition of a climber also befriended the bosses that mattered the most to his position, went to lunch with them and learned to talk about deer hunting and charcoal grills with them (Especially **Bossman the Bigot** from my previous story).

Whilst Brutus seemed to be thriving in this environment, I wasn't doing so well. All I had been getting lately was more and more middle managers and entitled coworkers to give me conflicting demands, and less and less autonomy to make my own decisions. I was being turned into a glorified code monkey.

Consequently, I was getting more and more jaded with my workplace and the people on its payroll. Some nights, I'd been checking Linkedin half-heartedly, but nothing much came out of it. Now that I look back at that, I guess I was getting a bit depressed, but I didn't realize it then. Everything was just kind of gray.

Lately, Brutus had become enamored with the idea of refactoring some major code. My code, that is...

Excerpt from the bi-weekly meeting:

\----

**Bossman**: ...all right. Are there other concerns? Anybody?

**Brutus**: Well, the <HammerPunisher's module> is too monolithic. That makes it hard to test and also inefficient.

**Me**: As I told you before, the module works well. We haven't seen performance problems in the lab, or in field tests. True, it could be made more easy to test, but there are also these features A, B and C that I should get done before June.

**Brutus**: (Speaking to boss, not even addressing me) Refactoring the module would be a really good idea before those. HammerPunisher could make <Algorithms that certainly don't need efficiency improvements> more efficient at the same time.

**Bossman**: That's settled then. HammerPunisher, start the refactoring first thing tomorrow.

**Me**: How should I go about it? Refactoring is a pretty broad concept.

**Bossman**: You are the expert, right? You decide the details.

Cool, another item to pile on my Mt. Everest of shitjobs.

Shortly put, refactoring is making the source code more readable and easier to maintain by e.g. splitting it into several smaller files and adhering to a rigorous standard on naming and formatting the source. Ideally, the process shouldn't change how the program behaves, just make the source code look different and be easier to test. In reality, it is very easy to inadvertently introduce new bugs in big refactorings like this.

What made this exercise especially pointless was, that the code was already in a pretty good nick. I admit some functions were a bit on the long side and one class could've been made more modular. But then again, no one else was working on this code apart from me, and no one else was slated for helping me out with said code (I wish there had been). I could already read and maintain my own work just fine, thank you very much. There were several more important features in the backlog that needed to be done ASAP, and guess who was going to get chewed up for missing those deadlines.

This wasn't the first case of jackassery I'd experienced in this company, but this was the one to wake me up. After that meeting, I didn't feel jaded anymore. I was seething. So, they wanted my code more efficient. They wanted my code refactored. Then refactored it was going to be.

Next morning, I started by compiling a massive todo-list featuring not only the list of suspected bugs in my code, but also all the inane feature requests written by Brutus in his leisure in the past months.

When examining a bug candidate, I decided, it would be good to do some refactoring at the same time. They demanded efficiency and, in a way, this would be an efficient way of working. Since I had been given authority to do the job as I best saw fit, I decided: My source code was hogging way too much space on our poor servers. It was of paramount importance to refactor the wasted space away.

I cracked my knuckles, my kneecaps and the joints in my neck, then started cracking the first bug.

Everybody knows that the fewer different characters there are in a file, the more *efficient* it will be to compress, right? So, a variable called something as bloated as 'packet\_counter' I swiftly renamed to 'l'. 'header\_offset' became 'll'. 'curr\_processed\_bytes'? Horrible. Better rename it 'lll'. What about 'response\_time\_ms'? I know. Let's make it 'llll'.

Whilst doing this and fixing the bug at the same time, I made sure to edit every single line on the files I touched. Streamlining the variable names helped a lot towards this end (I think I got to 'llllllllllllllllllll' in the file that got the 'l' treatment). I peppered most of the empty lines with helpful comments like ""// Every two times"" or ""// Remember to raise flag"".

I wanted to do as many changes as possible, because our code resided in a version control system (like e.g. GIT). The version control color-highlights every line that was changed, so you can compare the new and the original easily. If there are only few edits in a file, it's straightforward to spot the color-highlighted changes. On the other hand, if all the lines have been altered, pretty much everything is color-highlighted...

Also, because of the version control, no disgruntled programmer could have destroyed everything even if he wanted to, as there were multiple auto-downloaded copies on every coworker's computer.

Was I a disgruntled programmer? Nay, I was in the zone. I was getting a lot done.

Next week, I kicked it up a notch. Not content to just rename variables and functions, I shifted them around into different lines to make it harder to compare the new and original versions of the file. While I was at it, I decided to save some space by eliminating all those pesky constant numbers and #defines, substituting them with some healthy integers in the code. Some call them magic numbers. I called them economical.

Speaking of eliminating, I also axed heaps of unnecessary whitespace, like spaces and line changes. After that, the files made a pretty snug package. I committed the changes and uploaded them to our version control. A good week's work.

But I wasn't done yet. Since our code deals in low-level network traffic, there is a fair amount of bit twiddling here and there. For some reason that I can't quite recall, I found it very important to rename all the variables in those functions so that their names contained nothing but the following characters:

\- lowercase l

\- uppercase O

\- lowercase b

\- number 0

\- number 1.

Here is an example of a definition with those parameters:

int Obll01O = 0b110100 << l1O1 & O1;

After tackling the bit fiddling and having given the 'l', 'k' and 'e' treatment to several files, I allowed myself some leeway in the length of variable names.

I kind of toed the line when renaming the function screenUpdate() to scru(), so I made amends by designating a variable called 'uptime' a space-saving 'u'. And although a certain subclass in the WirelessApplication object contains routines for interacting with the network kernel stack, designating it 'wa\_nkr' was definitely a stretch. Originally, the screenUpdate() function didn't reside anywhere near the WirelessApplication, but I went above and beyond the call of duty to relocate it there. It was essential to be able to call 'wa\_nkr->scru(u)'.

At this point I recalled that the C++ string is quite a heavy datatype with a lot of overhead. So I did what any responsible programmer would do and replaced a couple of these with a pile of numbers that contained the ASCII values of the individual letters in said string. There was also this SqlHandler class that was getting too big for its own good, so I split it nicely into two parts, calling one of the instances sQlHandler and the other sQLHandler.

I made sure that all of my new code worked even though it might be a tad challenging to read. In fact, I double-checked these new features so thoroughly that I forgot to patch one interesting abnormality: The program featured a debug print that, at a point, outputs a couple of characters from an uninitialized memory space to the terminal every now and then. As the memory is uninitialized, these characters can be anything from letters to invisible control characters. When a test has been running for several hours, say overnight, the print has a tendency to spontaneously output some kind of terminal control sequence that turns all the text in the terminal window irreversibly into an unintelligible mush of weird symbols. It's pretty funny if you have left the test running overnight and relied on the terminal output to debug the results.

I knew this, but Brutus didn't, as he was never industrial enough to pull thorough testing sessions. He was also too lazy/confident/efficient to ever check on my progress on The Great Refactoring of 2019. Too bad. He could have caught these atrocities and maybe alerted some higher-up to put a stop to them.

During the next few weeks, I made sure to intertwine every bugfix I made with a shit-ton of ""helpful"" refactorings. Even with the help of version control, it's pretty much impossible to extract the useful modifications from the jumble of obfuscation without days and weeks of manual labor. You could revert back to the version before all of my refactoring, but then you would lose all the new features and bugfixes, some of which are critical.

Why the hell did I make such a mess of my code, you might ask?

Well, say I was to not come to work anymore one pretty morning. Say I was to leave the company for good. If such was the case, the responsibility for my code would be handed to the coworker that was next on the line. Someone who has proved himself the most versed on the subject, willing and able. And as my bosses had witnessed in so many bi-weekly meetings, regarding this particular software, the one with the most excellent knowledge was — Brutus the Backstabber.

You see, because of this incident and a lot of other stupid crap, I had finally found the energy to get back to the game of job-hunting, fueling the seek with my rage. After a couple of bad offers and fizzled interviews, I landed a pretty good candidate. A long and convoluted negotiations process ensued — I wanted to make sure I would not end up in a clone of my current company. Finally, I signed papers with a new firm, with a better salary and more interesting job prospects!

Brutus's face was a sight worth seeing when I dumped the pile of feculent Frankenstein code on him and waved a sweet goodbye.

But that's a story for another time. After all, the Great Refactoring was only the pettier of the two going-away gifts I dedicated to my beloved company. The other one was much more satisfying...

**TL;DR**: A climber of a workmate gets ahead at my expense, getting our boss to make me do pointless, huge changes to my software. Boss never specifies the way to implement the changes. I employ creativity to turn the code into a steaming quagmire of guano that works but is unreadable. I quit. The climber gets the now-illegible code dumped on him.",2019-07-03 14:20:02
No doctors appointment,28,c80hf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c80hf5/no_doctors_appointment/,1,1562016849.0,"Just need to calm myself down, hopefully writing this helps

I have certain shifts and since I started my job back in September 2017, they have never changed - only if a coworker was sick. That might mean a text message from my boss at 7am to tell me I’m working a closing shift instead of day shift which is fine with me.

About two months ago I made an appointment at my doctor which is on a Tuesday. I ALWAYS worked 2-9pm on a Tuesday. So I figured appointment at 9:15am is okay.
Then I went on vacation two weeks ago, came back on Friday and drove by work to check my schedule for weekends. This month I am not working any Tuesday but one. And guess what? It’s the Tuesday I have my appointment. That’s the second time since 09/17 I’m working a morning shift on Tuesday.
As soon as I saw this, I went to my boss and told him, I can’t open that day. He told me to ask one of my coworkers if she can cover during the time I’m at the doctor.

Today my boss came up to me and told me that it was unacceptable I did an appointment, because I should’ve known that I’m working this morning because ‘‘there’s always something that could happen“. Honestly I didn’t know what to say. No one let me know that they changed my schedule. How am I supposed to know they changed it?
I didn’t get my doctor appointment purposely during my shift, because well fuck I didn’t know I’d be working during this time. I did the appointment at that day and the time, because I was SURE I would NOT be working.",2019-07-02 00:34:09

Seniors called us nazis to all the other employees for not giving them ice-cream,64,c5j2l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c5j2l4/seniors_called_us_nazis_to_all_the_other/,4,1561512955.0,"Hello! I am new to this, so please bare with me as the introduction is long but relevant.

Over the summers I would go abroad and work in the US as a student, via a student visa. This one summer I was working on an island in Washington State, close to Canada, where people are really nice. The work I was doing was at a small marina store - it was like a mini all you might need for a boat store in 70% of it with basics ( from tampons, shampoos, soaps, nailclippers to little propane tanks for boat heating stoves to beer and wine to ice to cereal and other kinds of food and sodas), but on 30% of it behind the counter we'd make coffees and serve some fast-food for breakfast and lunch ( like sandwiches and burritos and fish and chips). So like a gas station store, but for boats. The store was placed on the main deck parallel with the docks that where on the water and tied by them so people could come on land nicely. With the 70% part of it facing the water and the 30% part facing the land. In order to avoid lines ( as it was the only store on a 10 mile radius for the boaters located at the marina), there were 2 windows facing the land behind the counter from which we would serve food and coffee and ice-cream. People would first order and pay inside, then pick up their stuff at the windows outside as instructed when paying and written on 10 signs ( as people in vacation tend to be relaxed and miss most of them). For food and coffee we would place them in the window and shout out their name as it was a small place. For ice-cream, however, they'd pay inside, then go by the window, chose their flavour from the window list with the receipt and get it. We had 2 types of ice-cream in the store: locally produced ice-cream that was hand scooped at the window and was the after the counter one and commercial ice-cream that would be found in the 70% section of the store.

Now to the story. I used to be the closing shift, and the main responsible of the closing. The other colleagues were mostly rotating. As some of you might know, the closing shifts where food is done means the most work for you for cleaning. It would be 2 of us each night when closing at least, someone at the counter, and someone else doing all the cleaning chores. Because it was just 2 of us, the closing would go like this : the store closed at 6:00 pm, so the food would close at 4:00 pm ( to have time to clean the small kitchen area, fryer, and stock up all the freezers and fridges for the next morning), and the scooped ice-cream and coffee 15 minutes before closing time - 5:45 pm - ( to clean the esspresso machine and the ice-cream lids, scoops etc) as written on a bunch of signs all around the store. Over the summer, we've learnt never to bend these times unless it wasn't busy, because if you stayed a minute later for a customer and it's busy, another one will come and ask for the service, and if refused, the old "" but you did it for these guys"" complain and unhappiness ( especially with scooped ice-cream in the middle of the summer). And after you'd be done serving them all you'd end up working overtime too much and get scolded by the manager. So respecting those times was key.

&#x200B;

Now, to present you the characters of this story:Me: is me ( a girl)Allie: the gril I was closing with that dayJay: a dockhand working closing shift on the docks, worked there for 5-6 years / summers already at that time

Donn: a very nice island local man and  store frequent customer

SM: Store Manager2 Karens in their 60's

2 Chads in their 60's

KKCC - Karen Karen Chad Chad

( I assume they were married - they were boaters at the marina for a couple of days on their very expensive iacht)

This area is where very rich people live and vacation, people who usually look for peace and calm, and older couples.

And off we go.So as me and Allie were closing in the middle of the summer, is 5:46 and I was just closing down the ice-cream window after serving the last customer - he had been in a couple of minutes before 5:45 the ice-cream closing time. Suddenly, 4 people that were heading in the store directions, the two Karens and the 2 Chads, rush their step, and as I turn away to finish the chores for the evening they knock on the window with signs all over it saying to order inside. I open up ( sometimes people would just ask for directions that way) and ask what can I help them with, and they tell me they'd like some scooped ice-cream. I look at Allie, I look at the clock, and notice other people coming down the deck and realize that if I do it we'll be scolded and cut down hours for working overtime. The conversation goes like this:

KKCC - We'd like some ice-cream

Me - We just closed down the ice-cream, it closes at 5:45, I am sorry, is now 5:47

KKCC ( aggressively) - But we've been waiting all day for this ice-cream, where does it say it closes this time

Allie: There is a sign inside

KKCC ( talking over her on a very spoiled kids kind of tone) : Please, we couldn't wait to get this ice-cream today, it's all we could think about

Me: I am very sorry, we will be here tomorrow morning from 7 am as well, we cannot serve you ice-cream as we need some additional time to clean the place and our manager wants us out of here by a certain time

KKCC: But there is no sign out here saying that it closes now

Allie : we have the sign inside ( there are mulpiple "" order inside"" "" only pick-up windows"" signs on those windows)

KKCC ( visibly angry at this point) : where there should be a sign out here, I see no sign out here saying that

Allie: Our boss doesen't likes us being here longer than neccesarily, and if we serve you ice-cream we will have to serve up everyone on the deck

KKCC ( spoiled kids face) : Just us four please, you just have to scoop it

Allie: Sorry, we can't do it

KKCC : But you gave an ice-cream to the person that just left

Me: They ordered it a minute before we closed, they were inside at that time paying for it

KKCC ( very entitled tone) : We want the name and the number of your manager

Me: Sure ( went over to grab and hand them a business card of my manager)

Now, these are all scraps from what I could remember they said, as they were all talking over us and at the same time, irritated and on a very entitled tone, when all of a sudden, one of the men goes like

Chad1: So what, do you just follow orders? Do you know who else followed orders without questioning? The nazis!!

KK Chad 2 : yes you are exactly like the Nazis, they did the same thing!!!

&#x200B;

Keep in mind, all this time they were getting angrier and angrier at us, with one of the Karen constantly shouting that there is no sign with the ice-cream closing time, the other one going "" please, just a small one, you just have to scoop it, I don't get what the big deal is"" the Chad nr 1 being the silent observer and the Chad no 2 complaining of poor service. While they were talking, we were trying to explain we have regular ice-cream inside, but they wouldn't listen. And after about 10 minutes of these kinds of talk and after asking for our manager's name and phone number, they were all on their way.

Also, this is an area where people are generally extremely nice.

After they walk away, a minute later Donn walks in right before we close for coincidentally a bar of ice-cream - the commercial one, he knows the times, being the regular that he is. We tell him what just happened, and he tells us he walked by the dockhands office and he saw them loudly complaining to Jay.

As I go and put the lock the door after Donn, I see this scene

Donn, shouting at Jay while the KKCC are furiously complaining: Hey, Jay, I got my ice-cream today!

&#x200B;

Later on Jay told us they mistook him for a manager, and they went over to tell him how only nazis acted the way we did, following orders like that, mindlessly.

The next day everyone at the marina was informed, including our manager ( if she'd have been there she wouldn't have been as nice as us to them) and they were banned from every docking there under the current owner as it's a private owned marina.  


Later edit: from the Marina business it was only us 3 working at that time, but we have other small shops on the docks, and they have also been complaining to those people about us being "" nazis"" and "" following orders just like the nazis did"" and to the dockhands manager the next morning, when he announced them they'd be banned from ever docking there.",2019-06-26 04:35:55
i worked in a physiotherapy office and had an insane intern,86,c46zbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c46zbl/i_worked_in_a_physiotherapy_office_and_had_an/,9,1561306240.0,"2 years ago I just had started working as a physiotherapist in a small physiotherapy practice and the only people working there was me and my boss.

One day I got informed that we would have an intern with us for a short term and later that evening I met her.

In the first day she seemed like a quiet person and reserved,and she was paying really good attention to learning the works and how to help out in the practice and in conclusion she seemed a normal person.

And then the second day comes where everything goes down to the drain..

So when she came in the second day to start she seemed very standoffish,aloof,and she did not spoke or greeted anyone when she first came in,and when we had our first appointment with a patient she kept tabs on me and follwing me around the whole day not giving me any personal space and she was disrupting my work.

She kept looking at the patients and my boss with a dead on stare and whenever someone spoke to her she would hide behind my back and look at them with disgust and despite all of that we let her finish one of my appointments because we were really packed and because my boss was late again as per usual and I had to run the place by myself until he comes.

So as she getting done with the appointment, the client was very pleased with her work and thanked her very kindly for her services,and now you would expect a normal person to reply kindly as well buuut she didn't..

She didn't say anything at all she just looked at the client with a dead stare while grimacing her face with disgust and there was a long awkward silence between the three of us.

My boss as well saw that something was wrong with her but we thought that she was just tired or maybe she smoked some weed.

And in the end of the day I brought her back home because she fell asleep during worktime.

The 3rd day she arrived at work with just a pair of pants and a bra and she wasn't wearing a blouse,as she came in she went straight to the storage room and changed her clothes there and that was very amusingly shocking to see.

The whole day she was being very clingy as fuck and not helping at all and the only person she spoke to that day was to a random patient to which she asked her many personal questions as if interrogating her and stated to her that she smokes weed. When I saw that happened I took her aside to ask her what is going on with her and if she's okay and I tried to explain to her that her behavior and attitude towards was not normal nor polite at all and she just gave me the most creepiest smile ever while a tear rolled down her cheek and I got freaked out and left.

In that day I told my boss everything she did and he decided to have a talk with her,he called her into his office and he reprimanded her about her mistakes and made it clear that the way she acted was unacceptable and while he said all those things all she said was ""Where can you do laundry here ?"" And demanded my bosses mother to clean her clothes.

And after that statement she seemed to have like a 360 change in her brain and apologized for her behaviour blaming her tiredness for the attitude she had these 2 days and asked if we could drop her home and when we left during the whole ride she was demanding me to bring her at Mcdonalds to eat.

The next day it became worse..

She kept touching people inappropriately,touching their hair and their personal belongings and most people left due to how uncomfortable she made everyone feel and me and my boss had enough of her antics so we were desperately trying to find a phone number from her relatives so they could take her away because she wasn't leaving no matter what we said to her or did to her. And in the end of the day she asked me again to drive her back home and I refused because I was really creeped out from her.

And in the final last day,

I finally found a phone number and passed it by my boss so he could handle the situation himself. And in the afternoon when she came at work she kept following me incessantly until I snaped at her and told her off,I informed my boss of her arrival and then when my boss came out to try and and diffuse the situation and tell her to leave kindly she got really pissed and started yelling non sensical things to him and my boss then called her brother and told him of the situation and warned him that if she doesn't leave the practice they would call in the police to the matter.

The brother told him that if he came there to whisk her away from the practice it would just escalate things even worse and advised my boss to call the police to handle her. When my boss phoned in the police and she realised what was going to happen she ran away from the office and we never saw her again since that day.",2019-06-23 19:10:40
I Insulted the Intelligence of her 2 year Old,78,c3eu0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c3eu0l/i_insulted_the_intelligence_of_her_2_year_old/,3,1561143641.0,"Small/local toy store employee. Fun fact before I start (for people who haven’t bought any kid toys recently) that toys will have some sort of labels on them. The labels can include where it was made, age recommendations, choking hazards, etc. From what I’ve observed, 95% of toys meant for ages 3+ are labeled as Choking Hazards. Not just a safety thing, but a liability for the companies. Relevant to this story. 

So I have a lady come in and walk up to me at the counter. 

Lady: “I need a toy for my 2 year old child. But before you say anything, he’s super smart. I mean like he’s so smart. He probably is too smart for all of your toys!”

I walk her to our building/manipulative toys to show her some recommendations. I was showing her stuff for her child’s age group (not labeled as a Choking Hazard). I showed her one after another and she just scoffed at all of them. I showed her one of our more popular toys for 2 year olds and she exclaims

Lady: “That is an insult to my child’s intelligence!”

I explain briefly how any older toys will most likely be choking hazards as I try with a few more. Finally, I give in and show her a toy for a 3 year old. Mind you, I had been trying to help her for a while now and went through dozens of toys with her. 

Lady: “That toy is a choking hazard! I can’t give that to my child!”

Me: “Well if you’re child is as smart as you say he is then he should know not to put tiny objects in his mouth!”

I had no control of that coming out of my mouth. I just spoke what was going through my mind and I immediately walked away before the customer could mutter anything. Boss had a good laugh at that one.",2019-06-21 22:00:41

To start, the daughter starts screaming that she needs to pee. The mother came up to me and asked for the bathroom key to which I gave it to her. Apparently, someone else was in the bathroom so she stomped her way to me and got mad. I apologized and told her that the person should be out shortly. She was irate. She went to the restaurant next door with her daughter (it wasn’t even open yet) and was slamming on the door and pulling at the handle. In the meantime, her son was walking around the store. I heard the bathroom door open in the back as she walked back in to grab the son. I told her that the bathroom was now open and she scoffed at me and went back to the restaurant. 

She comes back in and then it gets interesting. Our company likes to have all of the products brought to the edge to make it look full (common practice among stores). There is a specific section I always hated because we had things lined up on their sides and there was space in the back. Kids (as well as adults) like to shove the product all the way in and just laugh as they see me later go to fix it (reasoning is that since the section is so low, it makes the product hard to see so we need to fix it right away). 

The section is right by the register. I had fixed it a dozen times that day when the son goes over and starts slamming all the boxes in. I normally say “I’m sorry but please don’t push in the product.” But today I was exhausted from doing it enough that I walked over after him and fixed it. Within the second it took me to turn around, he starts slamming them in again! That’s when I said :

“I’m sorry but please don’t push in the product.”

The mom just laughs and goes:

“My son thinks it looks better that way.”

Me:”Well the company likes everything pulled to the edge so we try to keep it that way!”

Mom: “Well my son finds it more aesthetically pleasing.”

So to anyone that goes to stores THE STORE IS NOT YOUR HOME. You can’t just trash something or make it the way you want. You should be accountable for your actions and the actions of your children. My job is to keep the store nice, but it’s not to clean up personally after your kid makes a mess.   

I finish ringing the family up and they leave. About a week later, I’m at the register fixing a system issue when I hear the boxes being slammed in. I immediately say the usual “please don’t...” when I look up and see the mom there. 

Mom: “Yea, remember? They like everything pushed to the edge. You told us that last week remember?”

First off, if you remembered me saying it, why are you letting your son do that again??

Me: “Oh I’m sorry. I didn’t remember that you guys had been here last week.”

Mom: “What exactly is your job here?”

Me: “I’m an inventory manager....”

Mom: “It’s just so funny because I’m in here buying stuff for my son that’s gonna go towards your paycheck.”

Immediately that’s when I just ignore her existence. Don’t ever pull that move on an employee when you and your dumbass son can’t remember shit. 

She starts saying that I’m clearly not a nice person and I just ignore her as she’s speaking to me. My general manager was downstairs and I called her up because I couldn’t deal with this customer. Unfortunately, my GM got caught up while she was trying to come help me when the lady decided she wanted to check out. As I’m ringing her out, my GM notices where her son had slammed in all the boxes. She goes and starts straightening it and the lady notices. She finally realizes that it’s not just me being picky, but actually all the employees say the same thing. 

Mom “I’m sorry.”

I continue to ignore her as I’m ringing up her stuff. 

Mom: “Excuse me, did you hear me say sorry?!”

Me: “I did. And it’s fine.”

Mom: “Well clearly I’ve somehow offended you.”

Finished the transaction and she leaves. My GM has overheard that part and she was even saying how it was probably best to barely respond to her. 

Don’t treat retail people like shit. If you can realize that you made someone upset then you should stick to online retail where no one has to deal with your crap.

*Edit: When she was asking me my job title I forgot to mention how she kept reiterating that I’m not a nice person and I just seem mean...ok*",2019-06-21 16:24:59
sketchy manager.....,5,c36ob5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c36ob5/sketchy_manager/,0,1561095270.0,"&#x200B;

First I want to provide a little bit context for this situation. I started working at this fast food place two weeks ago. I am a college student and don't really ""need"" the job. I am just trying to make extra money for myself.The manager is pretty disorganized. Since I was new I wasn't officially on the schedule yet which I understood. He said he would text me the schedule when it was made and I was like okay cool. In order to work for my first shift I had to call and text many times to see when it was. He would say oh it isnt ready yet stuff like that. Eventually after calling a bajillion times he had me set up for Friday. After my shift I asked if I could see the other days work for the week. He said he was still working on it. On Saturday I asked if he had the schedule ready and he said no. Then on Sunday he texts me come in at 4, two hours before my shift starts. I was furious that I didnt get a heads up earlier on but I wasn't doing anything so i came in. He actually yelled at me when i got in on time and everything and he said next time i should call the store to fin my schedule even though I reminded him several times. He had my schedule for the week so everything was fine after than. My last shift of the work week was on a Thursday. Throughout the weekend I texted and called for the schedule and again he said he didnt have it. Then, on Sunday, same thing happens again, he texts me a few hours before my shift and demands that I come in. I was pissed. it was father's day but since my dad works on sunday we celebrate it on Saturday which isnt a big deal but I felt it was very disrespectful of him. That day I was talking to my coworker. She said she was also forced to come in on her day off and was upset because Sunday is the only day she could spend with her nephew. She also told the manager to not schedule her for sunday for the next work week. He scheduled her for Monday-Saturday. Then, today at work (thursday), he tells her that she will be working this Sunday and giving her off this Friday. This obviously got her really mad, as she should, because she made plans for Sunday because she thought she had the day off. I feel that this is extremely inconsiderate and he is a awful manager. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

also the manager made her work yesterday even though she had a 103 degree fever. so thats a thing.",2019-06-21 08:34:30
My boss thought I was a cop and nearly freaked out.,31,c34gun,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c34gun/my_boss_thought_i_was_a_cop_and_nearly_freaked_out/,3,1561081420.0,"A bit of context is needed for this... sorry about that.

&#x200B;

So I have a decommissioned police motorcycle. It's a fully dressed Kawasaki Police 1000, with working (amber) emergency lights and everything. The lights are legal and I have a permit to operate it as a security and motor escort vehicle.

&#x200B;

Before anybody thinks I bought the bike to impersonate a police officer, I didn't. I bought it because I wanted a nice, comfortable bike that has the performance characteristics of this one... that is comfortable enough for riding all day long, good for touring, also with sport bike like performance, and was something I could buy, in cash, up front, no debt or loan.

&#x200B;

To set the scene, I was wearing black pants, jack boots, black leather jacket, and a white half helmet with a microphone on it, and the same style of sunglasses cops tend to wear... Basically, I looked like a cop at a glance, which is kind of the point. I'm not impersonating a cop, but I figure if I'm going to ride a cop bike, I might as well look like I belong on one.

&#x200B;

So... now to the story...

&#x200B;

I work for a security company, and was actually brought in to the company by the owner of the company. The owner of the security company is a sheriff in a nearby county, and he hired me specifically because I have the police bike and wear the gear that I do. I'm also one of only a couple people that he's personally recruited to the company, and approves of my bike and the way I dress on it.

&#x200B;

I was going to a stand up meeting at a job site, and I ended up behind the head supervisor on the road... The head supervisor knows that I have the bike but he'd never seen me on it because the only other time he met me in person, the bike was in the shop and I was on a backup bike (I don't own a car). This guy knew I have the decommissioned police bike, but had never seen it and he was used to seeing me on a different bike.

&#x200B;

So the head supervisor sees me behind him at the stop light, and he noticed me pretty much instantly, because that's the point. People don't notice motorcycles, but they notice cops and things that look like cops.

&#x200B;

So he turns off the main road and onto this back road toward the job site. I turn off too and he's like ""well that's interesting...""

&#x200B;

Then he turns off the back road and onto the road with the job site, and I'm still right behind him. So he's starting to sweat at this point, because cops don't generally go down these roads, so he thought something might be up.

&#x200B;

He pulls off the second back road, into the job site. I pull off too, right behind him. Several other security guards are already there. The head supervisor, who we'll just call HS, didn't park his car like he normally would, instead, he just pulled off by the gate and sat there, blocking the gate, with his hands on the steering wheel.

&#x200B;

As I said, he was blocking the gate, so I couldn't do anything but stop right behind him. Another security guard comes up

&#x200B;

Other Guard: ""HS, what did you do?""

&#x200B;

HS: I don't know...

&#x200B;

I notice he turned his car off, so I just dismount without removing the helmet or anything, and I'm walking up and ask ""hey HS, you're here early."" Everybody there at that moment was actually a whole hour early to the meeting.

&#x200B;

(In this company, all security guards are called ""Officer"" and then their last name.)

HS: Wait, Officer Alice?

&#x200B;

Me: Yeah...

&#x200B;

HS: Oh thank god, I thought I'd done something wrong and you were going to write me a ticket.

&#x200B;

Other Guard: Wait, you're not a cop?

&#x200B;

HS: No, this is Officer Alice, she's training to be a new supervisor.

&#x200B;

Me: Well, you do have a brake light out, but I don't write you a ticket for that. But if you want I can call Sgt. Owner and let him know about the violation.

&#x200B;

HS: Haha, no need. Thanks for letting me know.

&#x200B;

Again, I want to stress that I do not impersonate a police officer. Wearing boots, pants, leather jacket, sunglasses, and a white half helmet is not impersonating a police officer, not even when riding a decommissioned police motorcycle. All the police in my area know me, know about me and my bike, and they wave to me and give me a thumbs up when they see me. The only time I've been pulled over for riding this bike is by a real motorcycle police officer who is also a veteran from the days when the Kawasaki Police 1000 was a staple of American police departments. He missed riding one and just wanted to chitchat.

&#x200B;

Also, I do not have this bike because of any desire to be a police officer or to have any air of authority. My being a security guard (rentacop) is because of the bike as I was hired by a police officer who owns the security company, after he saw my bike and met me. So again, don't tear into me about impersonation, cuz that's not what's going on here, at all.",2019-06-21 04:43:40

Weirdest job interview ever.,106,c1ma3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/c1ma3r/weirdest_job_interview_ever/,7,1560769987.0,"I am a software engineer. because my job is a 2 hour drive and a 2 hour drive back (every day!) I got a bit burned out after doing this for a year and a half and decided to look for something new. 

One company is quite close to home and I meet their qualifications, so interview happens through a recruiter. Big boss of the company and HR are excited and want me to spend a morning on the company floor. The company is a business that creates apps for the medical field to keep track of their data. They want me to meet the lot & do some tests. Sure.

Then I met their code.

To call it atrocious is an understatement. There was no naming convention for variables and functions, sql tables were all over the place, code was illogically put together and medior/senior developers' code was never reviewed upon putting in a pull request. In normal English: It's like watching the tower of Pisa being build and already seeing it lean over. I literally saw code like this, this is no joke:

    if (scheduledday.DayOfWeek.ToString() == ""Monday"") {
       variable1 = value;
    } else if (scheduledday.DayOfWeek.ToString() == ""Tuesday"") {
        variable2 = value;
    }

and so on it went. Classes were structured like this: first a few variables, then a few functions, then another couple of variables (public, protected and private were mixed and had no different naming conventions to keep them apart) and so on it went.

When I had the meeting with boss & HR lady after the morning, I told them the truth; they were sitting upon a ticking time bomb and I described to them in plain language why the code was poorly set up and would cause issues if left untreated, and probably already did so. Boss was... okay with the fact I brought it all up, and I requested that if they'd hire me, I'd put in a lot of time at the start to clean things up so adding new features would go a lot smoother. HR & boss were fine with it.

2 days later.

I get a mail with a decline - fine. But the way the email was emotionally set up put it like I was the one only complaining about trivial matters and that there's no real problem at all (It wasn't like I tried to run their code in Visual Studio on a laptop of theirs and constantly got exception errors for everything, so getting something done was difficult). Not only was the email very berating... they put the wrong first name in the salutation. (Dear 'Recruiter first name' instead of Dear 'OP') Good grief. But it was clear this was from somebody within the senior development team who was very emotional about it who wrote it all down.

Well, whatever. You do you. I got another job where I get paid a lot more than what they offered, and put it behind me. This was 2 weeks ago.

Last Saturday: letter in the mailbox. It was from a healthcare administration company demanding I pay a medical service or otherwise get a debt collector breathing down my neck. Problem with that was... I never got an earlier letter with invoice about this supposed service. And my wife and I never underwent that treatment. I never heard of the supposed doctor. And the person named in the letter didn't live at my address! So my wife called the company the letter came from and got the mistake straightened. I take a peek at the company's website... their company uses the bloody software! 

So I replied to the recruiter and the Boss/HR what I just got in the mail. I wonder what conversation their devs and Boss/HR are having right now, but I doubt they care.",2019-06-17 14:13:07

German shepherd puppies!!,78,bxojoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bxojoi/german_shepherd_puppies/,10,1559869704.0,"I work at a dog kennel. One of the mama dogs gave birth about a month ago (I say ""about"" because I forget how old the puppies are; their eyes are open and they have enough fur to keep them warm without a heat lamp, if that gives you a better picture).

The mama dog, Reba, is an absolute sweetheart. I love Reba. She lets me play with her puppies, as long as I follow her rules (most German shepherd mamas I've met at my job have not been open to letting humans touch their babies so soon, so this is really amazing for me). Reba's rules are as follows (I'm paraphrasing, of course, because my Doggish isn't perfect):

1) The human must sit inside the baby area in order to hold a baby. Standing and holding a baby is not allowed. Babies must always be where Mama can reach them.

2) Babies are allowed to lick and nibble however they please.

3) Humans must talk to babies and tell them how beautiful they are.

4) Humans must also scratch Mama Reba behind the ears and tell her what a good mama she is.

5) Mama Reba decides when human visit time is over. When this occurs, Reba will guide the human to her yard's exit. Humans will listen to Reba, or Reba will be forced to take aggressive action.

**ANYWAY**

I've never seen Reba get aggressive with humans, but she is still a German shepherd mama (honestly, I don't mess with *any* mama mammals; I value my life, thank you), so I always obey her rules, which I think are more than fair.

Her babies are so cute right now! They're all at that stage where they have little potbellies, which is just so funny to me, because adult German shepherds are so regal and elegant, but the puppies look so silly (but in a very cute way).

They don't like being cuddled by humans yet, but they like to be picked up under the armpits (I know dogs don't have armpits, but that's the best way to describe it) and held in front of a person's face, especially if you gently bump your nose against theirs.

Sorry, I know that's a weird place to end, but I wanted y'all to hear about the puppies! I hope you enjoyed!! 💝🐶💝",2019-06-07 04:08:24
Blocking the Choosing Beggar coworker with a Micromanager,193,bws9n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bws9n6/blocking_the_choosing_beggar_coworker_with_a/,15,1559673484.0," Sorry for the length of this interminable rant. TL;DR at the very end.

&#x200B;

I am a software engineer by trade. Not willing to be more specific than that, in fear of swift retribution from petty bureaucrats at the middle management.

There *are* some genuinely good guys at my job. Sadly, they're a minority on the verge of extinction. I work mainly with shitlarks.

There is Bossman the bigot, openly racist and proud of it. There is Brutus the backstabber, a backtalking human replicant who not only hides knives into other people's backs but steals credit wherever he can. Also featuring Lord Varys – the master of unloading the burden of his ""great"" ideas onto unsuspecting workmates, rewarding them richly with blame when his grand plans inevitably go south. I'm pretty sure he's an eunuch, too.

With a host of lesser minions they have turned the office into a shitshow of the century. However, this story is not about them. Tonight's top billing:

&#x200B;

* The micromanager, whom we shall refer to as **Marc** with a C.
* The constant pain in the arse, who henceforth is to be known as **Francis C. Begbie**.

&#x200B;

Begbie is the guy that worms his way past the defenses of formal issue-tracking and schedules approved by our superiors. He slithers to your desk when the bosses aren't looking, dons his most pleasant semblance of a smile, and asks if you could implement just one small feature for him, I'm sure it won't take long, could you do it just this once, please?

When I started my job, I was a nice guy. I thought it's a decent thing to help your coworker when he's in need. I was young and eager, and so was our company. We had a shit-ton of coding to do, too few guys to do it. More often than not, I had too much on my plate already, but I still took some Begbie's requests on it, since I was a nice guy.

Begbie was not. After implementing any kind of gadget or widget for him, I would invariably find him hissing at my cubicle, having shed his smile somewhere along the way. ""It's too complicated to use!"", ""Why is the output so messy?"", ""Why can't you make X so that it does Y instead of Z??"" or something as charming.

After a while I started stalling with his requests, being still too nice to say outright ""no"" like I should have right from the start. I could have. He was my equal and should have had no power over me. When I finally did say no, Begbie had gotten a taste of bossing me around.

Begbie upped his ante. He started to carry his requests to my nearest superior, Marc. Which, I guess, would be the more correct way of doing things, if done right. The superior reviews requests and assigns them to his underlings, taking care not to overburden his charges, keeping things balanced, equal and nice. Everybody's happy.

However, Begbie did it the Begbie way: instead of participating in the bi-weekly workload planning sessions in which all the coders were supposed to be present, he started having quick one-on-one meetings with Marc in which he hypnotized my boss with his mesmerizing CB gaze or some other snaky shit. In the following bi-weekly session, the result transpired:

**Marc:** HammerPunisher, you got much to do?

**Me:** Well, yeah, I got the issues A, B, and C you just assigned to me in project 1. And bugs D and E to fix in project 2, plus the documentation for client F.

**Marc:** I heard from Begbie that he needs you to do feature X. Can you do that?

**Me:** Actually, I don't think I have enough time to do even A, B and C.

**Marc:** Begbie said X should take a couple of hours at max.

**Me:** From what I understand, it will take more like three days to...

**Marc:** Ok, that's settled then. We will assign feature X to HammerPunisher. Meeting adjourned.

Now, the excerpt above might sound like shitty managering, but I assure you, it was exactly that. For a first few months in this job I assumed that this is a normal way for a manager to handle things. You see, I was fresh to the working world and naïve. But as time passed, it was becoming more and more apparent that Marc took glee in lording over his subjects and stamping out their initiative. Especially mine, as I didn't push back like Brutus the Backstabber or guile my way out of unpleasant tasks like Lord Varys.

My prophecy came true and coding Begbie his beloved X took three days. Three days I could have spent on fixing actual problems that, I dunno, clients actually paid for. This didn't stop my favorite coworker from complaining about the lack of usability, the lack of documentation, the lack of options, the lack of X not being Unix, GNU and Google combined. These were addressed in the next bi-weekly. Every time I implemented something Begbie had asked for, he craved improvements and additions. For those improvements and additions, he craved more improvements and additions... I should commend my coworker, for he had invented the perpetual motion machine.

I was starting to fall behind with my workload. But every time when I pretty justifiably opposed Begbie's specials in the bi-weeklies, Marc torpedoed my protests and served me on a silver plate whatever shit the slithering fuckheap friend of his could muster. And he did it with that ever-so-slight smug grin on his face.

So, weeks passed and I toiled.

By a miracle of undefined sorts, there came a day I had less work than usually on my backlog. I don't know if I felt like being a proactive company man, or if I just wanted to rob Marc the satisfaction of getting to dictate my actions for once. Hell, maybe I was just happy that I had dreamt of Lord Varys slipping on a banana peel and cracking his skull on the sidewalk or something. I can't remember. But anyway, I had gotten yet another request from Begbie, and this time decided to fulfill it of my own volition.

Come the bi-weekly:

**Marc:** HammerPunisher, you got much to do?

**Me:** Well, not that much right now. But I talked with Begbie and he asked me if I could implement this feature Z thing for him. I thought maybe I could do it next?

**Marc:** Yes. Well. Ah. Err, I would say... I would say it's better that we stick to the assigned schedule.

**Me:** You mean?

**Marc:** Let's not pick any additional requests from outside the planned agenda. After all, we don't want to fall behind with the schedule. Meeting adjourned.

I ambled back to my cubicle, feeling kind of flabbergasted. I felt kind of angry, too. That controlling cuck had once again vetoed my opinions just to veto my opinions... until a light bulb lit above my head. Maintenance had finally fixed the lighting over my cubicle, I noticed.

But I also noticed that I could play Marc's zeal for micromanaging against Begbie's passion for unending tasking.

The next time Begbie needed something from me, I was sure to present the request to Marc, suggesting I could start working on it right away. Not surprisingly, Marc told me to wait until the bi-weekly meeting. In the meeting I volunteered to start working on Begbie's latest ASAP. Net result: Marc explicitly forbade me from doing anything of sorts.

I've been keeping this up for several weeks now. The system works beautifully. I keep shielding myself from Begbie with Marc's impenetrable wall of micromanaging. Whilst Marc thinks he's still getting one over me by denying my requests, Begbie's in a dead end.

I've seen less and less of him in the last few days. I would love to say that he's come to realize what a douche he was, but I don't believe in miracles anymore. However, I do think he's in the process of finding someone else to leech on, which puts a slight, cautious smile on my lips every morning.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: A choosing beggar coworker and a micromanaging boss treat me like bat guano. After an interlude of despair I discover a way to play their shitty personalities against each other. Like matter and antimatter, two colliding shittinesses negate each other, leaving just energy and brightness.",2019-06-04 21:38:04

The most disorganized workplace ever.,36,bubdaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bubdaz/the_most_disorganized_workplace_ever/,4,1559112588.0,"Whoa boy, a place where i can share this mess of a story, well lets go.

Three weeks ago (YES THREE WEEKS, yes it was that bad that i wasn't even there for a month!)I ended up going to work in a warehouse for a company that sold organic products, don't know if its just me but i felt horrible doing it because most of it was snake oil , like a spray that claimed to wake you up in minutes, some oil that claimed to calm you down, ect. now the first two days were alright, weirdly enough if you've worked in a warehouse, its what you'd expect. But there was a catch, for about a week and a half, we picked and packed, meaning we scanned orders and sorted them , then after we scanned them and packed them for shipping.

After that they wizened up and we ended up splitting off into pickers and packers, Sounds great right? well not really. with these changes came even more problems. me and my family plus my girlfriend all worked there, and we all ended up getting put in as packers, I loved being a packer until we heard the crazy numbers they wanted for it. 100 units an hour. Meaning 100 different items sent through the system in their own orders per hour, but you can't really hit a goal when the place is massively disorganized right? so soon after the new goal was put in, my family, and my gf, were berated for not hitting our goals, and soon after we found out why, now to hit the goal you needed some decently sized orders, meaning no 5 item orders including some toilet paper , which they did sell it was just made out of bamboo and sugarcane. no you needed these giant orders of 15-20 small items which scanned easy, fit in a small box and were super easy to push out of the building.

We had two sets of rollers, one on top that had the containers of orders for us to pack, and the bottom was for pushing orders to the general labor guys, they'd just pack the items onto a pallet, wrap them up and have someone ship them out. now my job was basically scan, wrap , pack, close box, push it down the line. Simple right? wrong. my family and me were on the end of the line next to the general labor guys, so basically all we got was the super small orders that didn't allow you to hit the goal even if you tried. So what did our boss try? CARTS! they'd load up carts now and bring us 12 orders each, should hit these numbers now right? WRONG AGAIN SUNNY JIM!

They assigned two of the general labor guys to bring everone carts, The thing with this was they chose the guys who lived together with a handful of workers in packing! What a coincidence! So when me and my dad (we worked back to back in our station) Were receiving these  two item, three item orders, we were hitting way below our goals. Which then prompted our leads to come ask why, when we said we were getting nothing good all night, they just accepted that the place wasn't going to work as smoothly as they expected. Mind you this is only the end of week 2.

Week 3 starts, I'm no longer optimistic coming into this company every day, I ended up buying an mp3 player for 15$ and loaded it up with some creepypastas and random horror stories just to get me through the nights. Wednesday comes around, my brain is so frazzled by how bad the place is that i accidentally forgot to pack a box right so it came back. now this next part i'll have to explain because i didnt really mention it anywhere near the beginning , my bad!Now i have bad anxiety and i tend to think poorly of myself when im working, things like i'm not working well enough, i'm going to get fired, ect. so when they brought the box back i ended up being a little upset, but i just sat there and caught my breath, little did i know this one little action was going to start a domino effect.

I come in the next day, job's still horrible, still getting sh\*t orders, the usual. They ended up giving VTO (volentary time off) to a handfull of packers and pickers..... when there was an entire nights worth of work...... and these people just got to go home after 2 hours on shift.

Now me being pissed that all these people are leaving when there's so much to do, i get a little angry, y'know i just kinda grumble to myself and my dad on ""How we all couldve been done early if they just kept us all here"" because supposedly we had a little less than what we usually did. Now our rollers for boxes, yeah those weren't powered. They were pushed by us. the same guys who got yelled at to meet a goal also had to stop mid packing to fix jams in the line, push the boxes, and more. But when they gave out VTO, they left a massive line of empty stations behind me, so for the rest of the night i was HAULING A\*\* just to meet my goal and to keep these damn boxes moving, i was complaining about it of course, but in my head i kept thinking that the more i pushed boxes, the less TP i had to pack up (those packs of toilet paper were annoying to say the least) my dad ended up yelling at a boss who told me to ""Stop pushing all of the boxes"" after she kept jamming the line, which i thought nothing of until my boss pulled me to the side. now he put me in their small board room with him and another lead and asked me why i freaked out at the one boss, which i didnt, i told him so and he brought up the night before. ""I have anxiety"" i told him, which he then threw out as bullsh\*t and asked why i flipped out on the boss again. now me being on the verge of a nervous breakdown and not wanting to get fired, i quit , told my mother what happened and walked out of the building.

&#x200B;

The next morning, my family took off, me and my gf chilled out playing some ps4, and come to find out he told my temp service that my family didn't clean up their stations after he kicked them out to drive me home. I was surprised because the guy was super cool until then, even gave us a jumpstart when our car decided to fail.

I ended up doing some research on the company and looked for a place to tell this (Found this place, super glad i did) And it turns out that grove has been fake reviewing themselves on indeed and a couple of other sites, always 5 stars, basically praising the job like its a great opportunity and acting like nothing goes wrong. maybe this thread will keep some people away from them.

A couple of extra things i wanted to point out

Some of their mock reviews said they supplied snacks, they don't, they have vending machines, guess free food is too much for a company that charges 10$ for some TP

One review said that the job is relaxing, it's not, they're constantly on your a\*\* about numbers and the ""Company goal""

And lastly, i gave my boss all the respect in the world until my last night, and then the guy has the balls to say that i'm a liar and that i did things i was accused of. Seems like i misplaced my respect.",2019-05-29 09:49:48
Slaves of wage in Southeast Asia,36,btuzvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/btuzvp/slaves_of_wage_in_southeast_asia/,5,1559013213.0,"Pretty much rant story here. KQL

The workplace is far from the main city, but at least it's in an industrialized area. It's a workshop focused on manufacturing bags for big name clients from various oversea countries. The owner is a Korean, and he got his Korean friends to work as Upper Management. The workshop size is decently big, with around 500 workers and 50 talented graduates doing important tasks to keep the place running smooth in an office room.

&#x200B;

By the law the minimum wage for the whole country is $200, and that's exactly how much everyone here is getting paid, before tax. At least the cost of living is only $150 monthly if you save everything, just perfect for the minimum wage.

&#x200B;

Each working day starts at 7 AM and the first thing employees must do is straight out of a Korean Drama movie: forming up a line before their Korean superiors and bend their body 90 degrees to greet them one by one personally before proceeding into the workshop, and that's how attendance management is done here. The workers go off to their designed group and the graduates go to the office room. The manufacture process is very organized, seeing the workload getting divided and assigned neatly is very awe-inspiring, is what I thought. Work continues until 12 AM then everyone gets a 30 minutes break. Then at 4 PM everyone gets another 15 minutes break and finally ends at 7 PM for the workers, people in the office room have to stay to 8 PM to finish stuff. So if you count from 7 AM that's 11-12 hours of work a day, and this place runs on a schedule of 6 work days a week.

&#x200B;

Moving on to other interesting points; when any person from the upper management team is involved, everything seems to change into a hellish scene that reeks of toxicity that shouldn't even exist in this date. But I guess since this place is far from the civilized city so is everyone's civilization here. People try to expose others' mistakes to the Korean gods to appeal them like a kid that goes ""see, I'm better than this guy since he made mistakes"" in hope of receiving a business smile and a bit of bonus to the pathetic $200 wage. And of course not everyone can speak Korean so they have to go through their Interpreter. Inevitably the Interpreter holds an invisible power in here as he is the only bridge between the employees and the employers unless you got extensive Korean language knowledge, even then it's still hard to converse with Korean old men in 50-60, each using their own regional dialect. Anyone fool enough to not get on his good side will see that the guy twists your words around on purpose and interjects his own opinions into whatever you wanted to bring to the Korean gods. At worst the guy just doesn't translate your words or tell them it was so dumb that he couldn't translate it.

&#x200B;

The Koreans also are not what I expected from an image of a business man either. I don't know if it's their homeland's culture but every single of them is a loud, noisy cunt. Their talking at ""normal voice"" could be mistaken for a fight from people new to the place. Every move that's made by them always raises enough noises to alert everyone ""your gods are here"": stomping on the ground with each moving step as if marching, opening and closing the door as if trying to destroy the door and the wall (there are paint bits and dust falling off every time they touch a door), and what broke me the most was their screaming at the employees.

&#x200B;

Those Koreans' way to discipline their employees is abnormal. It always involves anger and a lot of screaming. It seems their go-to way of how to discipline people is to make an example of someone as much as possible so that others won't dare to make any mistake. The process starts with them calling out the poor victim into the middle of the workshop and the begin to unleash their deafening voice and throwing out spits into the victim's face repeatedly for as long as 30 minutes. I've seen it so many times but I never could get used to that kind of disturbing scene. And the obvious thing is the employee doesn't understand what are they saying. It's no longer discipline in my eyes, that's just pure torture. I'm still young here, I'm always amazed at the tolerance of people working here and I keep wondering whether I can get such tolerance level later in life; no one dares to say anything back during the yelling. If I were the victim I'm sure I'd get a case of criminal assault on me instead.

&#x200B;

2 months after my entry to the workshop a woman worker around 40 got called to the middle of the workshop and the usual thing happened. Apparently she showed up late because her child was sick and she had to drive them up to a hospital in the city. The screaming went on for a while. The Korean's face was red, and so was her. It's really frustrating to hear someone screaming in your face and you don't even understand what are they saying. I had 2 years in Korean but even then I couldn't catch anything from his mouth at all. Then the woman tried to speak back in her language trying to explain the circumstance. Immediately the Korean screamed at the woman, cutting and extinguishing whatever the woman was trying to say. She cried then stepped out the workshop while the yelling continued behind her.

&#x200B;

After that I just kept saying to myself: What the hell is this place? Why is this allowed? Why do people accept this? So this is the fate of people born and work in a ""developing country""? How can they live with pretty much no income? Any of them would be in deep trouble the moment some accident or illness spur on them with that kind of wage. Heck it's borderline impossible to support a child with that kind of pay.

&#x200B;

Days later I called in to quit. Got out of there, stopped all my study about Korean language. I know it's just only one workplace I've been in but I actually developed an intense hatred for all Korean after this experience. I don't want to work for people who treat their employees like that. I don't want to aid people like them to run a slave house in my country. While the law forbids extreme work hours or abuse in workplace but they can just pay up a tiny fine and then continue as usual whenever someone manages to sue them up. Fucked up. And the same words can be applied for my study and work history after this, fucked up.",2019-05-28 06:13:33
The story of Arctic scam,52,btlwjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/btlwjk/the_story_of_arctic_scam/,1,1558963066.0,"Okay, this is my first post here, and english isn't my native language, so I hope You'll forgive me. :P I decided to write it mainly 'because of rslash and and joy that such stories give to other people.

So... a little background: I'm a graduate of Maritime University, Navigation faculty. I've been to Svalbard few times (and love the Arctic) and sail on yachts since 13 years old (and I mean: SAIL first time at sea I encountered 10 degree Beaufort storm).

During spring break I was looking for some job and as I have friends at one of Arctic Stations, they gave me contact to a son of an Old Guy with yacht working as ""polar taxi"". I contacted him and immidietly was hired to work for plane tickets, food and percent of money clients would spend on that ""yacht-taxi""... but - and this is entirely my fault - we DID NOT HAVE IT ON PAPER (I belive You already know where it is going). It was just geantelman agreement.

""Well"" - I thought - ""I'll spend two months in place that I love, will sail throu most beutiful region of the world, do not see sunset or sunrise and meet greate people"". Oh my... how much I was wrong.

First bad sign was that after 14 hour of flights (three flights to be exact) there was no one to take me from airport (note here: going on foot from airport to city of Longyearbyen may be dangerous due to polar bears - or so I was told). After about hour girl greets me with smile on her face and joyful ""Oh, You are the new guy that they tricked to come here! Just call me if You want to leave!"" Those are her exact first words to me.

So.. it turns out that:

- there were two guys before her and they cannot stand Old Guy
- she cannot stand Old Guy
- Old Guy do not cook (he wants crew member to cook)
- Old Guy must take his medications regularly, tends to forgot about that and is just grupy as f\*ck
- Old Guy have specific... approach... to safety.

""Okay"" - I though - ""I've been in similar situations, I had grumpy captains during sea voyages and grumpy major during military training... and besides: every bad start leads to good ending, right?""

So after some talk I met the ""old captain"" and OH MY GOD... imagine most dried old man... this guy should not even been carbon dated. Redshift dating would be more appropriate. He was grumpy, but nothing special - as I said: I have my experience with old people.

Then the brave vessel! On wiki page I found out that it was ""home finished"" and thought of like ""Home, Sweet Home"" atmosphere of love and perfectionism. Rotting wood, kingston without a door and f*cking diesel geneartor loud as 80dB (I had sound meter in my phone) running ALL THE TIME. Oh... and did I mentioned that sails were taken down? Jaay! ""Sailing yacht"" was just a motor vessel.

""Okay"" - I again thought to myself, but little less convinced - ""Every bad start leads to good ending, right? I'll met wonderful people there!""

And I did met them. I again visited Hornsund, talk with one of the most wonderful people on the planet and while going back to Longyearbyen... have to take care of them. You know: coffee, sandwiches etc. - because Old Guy was literally unable to make food. How the hell was he able to reach such ancient age without most basic skills?!

Next voyage was just across the fiord - some French tourists want to get picked up due to polars bears in vicinity... and want their kayaks from city. So again: I was doing all the hard work to bring kayaks to boat and secure them - but it's not the worst thing to happened: I'm young, pretty strong guy so I have no problem im doing such work insetead of Old Guy. Going to fiodrs during strong gale is another thing...

Again little note for those who do not sail: sailing yachts are very easy to list - they are mainly stabilized by sail.. with no sail - forgot about stability. Just 30 degrees starboard, 40 degrees portside, 30 starboard, 40 portside... and so on, and so on...

How do You think Old Guy behaved during that time? Took his medicine and go to sleep... because: why not (this is fifth day of my presence there, and I do not fully know the vessel).

After few hours as we reached the small bay. Wind and waves were pushing us toward shore. So again: Old Guy told me to ""Keep her in this position"" and LEAVE ON A SMALL BOAT to talk to turists. As yacht was closer and closer to shore I gently push the engine throttle and IT STAYS IN MY HAND. Old Guy return when echosounder was in full alarm mode and botton of the ship was tuching rocks.

Me: ""You didn't take the radio, I was unable to...""

OG: ""I forgot to tell You that it sometimes fall of, just use the wrench""

And he uses a wrench as the throttle...

(Okay, I hope You are not bored, we are near to the end).

As we move to another bay to wait for sea to calm down I started to think about leaving this place... Like... I love Arctic and fiords of Svalbard but not enough to stay there forever...

In the morning (very loose term as it's polar day) we will hoist the anchor and move back. But: there was no electic windlass - there was manual one: just gearbox and long metal stick to move it forward and backwards - forward and backwards taking about 10 cm of chain for each move. AND IT BROKE. It worked only one way now and we have 16 meters of chain to lift...

""Well"" - I thought to myself again - ""At least I'm working in most beautiful place in the world, right? We'll talk about money as his son presented a little different vision of what I would do here"".

We set our figurative sails and go back to Longyearbyen.

Me: ""Okay, so all of this is much different that Your son told me... and I kinda know it should be discussed earlier, but as I'm doing most of the work and the environment of this work is much worse that i was told: I don't tkink  small cut from tickets is enough""

OG: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell You, as we took a loan to make this trip possible I would not be able to pay You""

I. WAS. LIVID.

Me (very, very calmly): ""Okay, than I don't think it's going to work. I'll take my things ashore and rebook flight.""

OG: ""There is a rule here, that if someone resigns, he's going back on his own""

Me (less, but still calm): ""You mean - You won't rebook my flight after a week of doing nearly all the work for You?!""

OG: ""No, there are rules"".

""Okay..."" - I thought - ""Your rules. Big, cute f*ck You old prick. I don't want any more interaction with You anymore.""

So I go ashore, buy ticket for the next week and stayed in Airbnb. Old Guy decided to sail away alone... and here is a little karma that I find out while back home.

During time I was warming my feet in blanket and play Fallout New Vegas in Airbnb this guy nearly DIED. He was not able to make food, forgot about medications, could not operate yacht and called his son to fly to him!

At the end: bad beginning really always end well: at the airport I met two wonderful guys from US and when I finally will be able to get a green card I'll definitely visit them!

Oh and: as all the photos of this voyage are on the phone that broke (Samsung XCover 4, display is black and not responding) I'm unable to post any photos of this wreck of a yacht, but If I'll find out how to download them to my PC - I'll gladly show You a video with sound of this damn generator.",2019-05-27 16:17:46
boss is completely insane? help?,53,bs4dbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bs4dbx/boss_is_completely_insane_help/,15,1558625548.0,"I started a new job a few months ago as the assistant manager in a shop that's part of a well known international retail chain. My boss seemed like a nice lady at first, albeit stressed out and also dealing with some heart problems (she says her heart is 'leaking' but she can't get to a cardiologist because we live on an island?). She took on the position about 6 months ago and I figured the existing staff had given her a hard time settling in.

&#x200B;

I joined and, not to toot my own horn, really helped get the store back on track. I helped ease up the massive growing deficit, cleaned up the building and got the health and safety and loss prevention shit back on track etc etc. I got along great with the boss and the staff accepted me, so everything was dandy.

&#x200B;

The boss lady is a little odd, she believes in past lives and one night tells me this whole weird story about being a nun in a past life. I'm an atheist but I didn't want to be rude so I just Joe Rogan-ed my way through the story like 'mmhmm' 'uh huh'. (Big mistake, in retrospect.) She also loves Tom Cruise movies and mentions him once a day.

&#x200B;

She also tells me that she knew Patrick Swayze irl. She teared up when she mentioned him, but was super vague and didn't give any details as to when or why. I thought it was a little far-fetched (we're from a small town in Canada) but kinda believed her, stranger things have happened.

&#x200B;

Anyway, one day about 2 months into the job, she randomly looks at me and says 'I met him you know.' I asked who. 'Tom Cruise.' (We hadn't talked about him that day.) She says Swayze introduced him to her. But she doesn't give any other details until we're alone the next day. Then she tells me that Tom Cruise saved her daughter's life, and that she would be dead if it weren't for him.

&#x200B;

I obvs don't believe her but I don't say anything. At this point her 'heart medication' is causing her to act increasingly strangely, and customers think she's drunk. She's swaying all over the place, slurs her words, can't focus or draft an email, etc etc. Her daughter apparently DUIs and totals her car, so she gets a ride every day.

&#x200B;

She mentions Cruise and/or Swayze once a day. Cruise loves the tattoo on her ankle. Cruise does really good things for people. Cruise loves his dad and would do anything for him. Swayze loves the fact that she uses aliases all the time (small wtf there). Cruise and Travolta do good work in looking after child stars in Hollywood. She says I'm only the fifth person she's told all this to, because she 'doesn't want to end up in someone's tell-all book' and that his kindness could be misconstrued as 'a movie star taking advantage of a single mom with three kids'.

She tells me about an incident in which she, her brother and Tom Cruise were out on the town one night and an 'incident' occurred. She says it was witnessed, so she and her bro whipped out their checkbooks and just asked 'how many zeroes?' to make it go away, because it was 'potentially career-ending'.

&#x200B;

One day she's having a bad day at work and leaves for an hour, then comes back and says she was meditating and talking to her spirit guides and the store has a really low vibration and we need to raise it. (Not in my job description btw) She also says that she asked one of her spirit guides to stay with her that afternoon for support, that he's a really great guy and super funny but also rational and down to earth. Later she's moving some boxes through a doorway and she shouts at the stock girl, 'Did you see that? I was stuck in the door and my spirit guide opened it for me! It flew open! I love that guy!' (I asked witnesses and apparently she just opened the door herself.)

  
SO here's the kicker. She's talking to an employee with a recently-deceased parent (very tragic situation) and tells her to meditate because the deceased person would come visit her. She says that's how she communicates with her spirit guide, Patrick Swayze. Swayze is the spirit guide.

&#x200B;

And the reason he died? Because she's cursed. She says any man she loves dies. She says she slept with Patrick Swayze, and that's why he inevitably got pancreatic cancer and died. She says it's why her partner died 16 years ago. And Tom Cruise *wanted* to sleep with her, but she wouldn't let him because she knew he would die too.

&#x200B;

And now she's started treating me really badly. Her scatterbrained-ness is causing her to fuck up and mismanage the store more than I can continue to repair, and she can't take criticism or own her mistakes so she's starting to blame it on me and tries to start arguments on the daily. She takes everything super personally and emotionally and the employees are too afraid to communicate with her. She's late to work every day. She says mean and accusatory things about people above and below her in the company and straight up argues with customers.

&#x200B;

But then she just blames it all on the store's 'low vibrational energy'. I'm not even 3 months into the job and don't know what to do. Any suggestions?

&#x200B;

tl;dr: boss claims she slept with Patrick Swayze and thus caused his death, but he's now her spirit guide, and she's friends with Tom Cruise.",2019-05-23 18:32:28
Boss attempts DUI with me in car,57,bpr8y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bpr8y4/boss_attempts_dui_with_me_in_car/,6,1558099587.0,"I've decided to post about this since some time has passed and looking back on it now it was really kinda fucked up situation that ended up working out.

&#x200B;

In September 2018 I started working for SHI (Shit heads Inc) and the job seemed alright from the interview and descriptions. Sounds like I would be traveling and fixing IT equipment which means I get do do new things more often which is huge upgrade from working 3rd shift at a datacenter.

&#x200B;

First week is when I discovered the job was not what I actually signed up for. Instead of using my IT skills I simply spend 10 hours a day loading industrial vending machines all while on a business trip on the other side of the state. When I talked to my boss about my concerns he said ""Next week will be better, We just needed your extra hands this week"".

&#x200B;

Jump forward to next week where we are in another city and I ride with my boss (Let's call him Corey) all the way to there which is roughly 3 hour drive. The entire way there he asks me about religion and my beliefs to which I answer pretty much everything with ""I don't really know, I am not religious"" in an attempt to make him stop. Overall really weird drive but nothing that I can't brush off as long as he does not expect me to be religious to work there.

&#x200B;

That night we went out to eat and drink with a customer and Corey had a few to many which was obvious from both me and the customers point of view. He was well over the legal limit and could barely walk let alone drive. Which as the restaurant is closing down he decides this is a good time to pry some more about my religion. More just general BS but this time he clearly states ""SHI is a christian company and if you are not then that might be a problem."" Thankfully at this point we had paid the check and I told him well it's time to go and I got up and walked out.

&#x200B;

Now we are outside and I ask for his truck keys because there is no way he is driving. He fights me on it but stand firm and tell him there is no way I am getting in that truck with him driving. After about 10 minutes I convince him to give me the keys and I drive us back to hotel. Once we get there we go inside and I hand him his keys before going to my room. He then leaves the hotel and drives somewhere. At this point I am pretty pissed and after a conversation with my fiancee I decide it's best to quit and have her drive all the way here to pick me up.

&#x200B;

I call Corey and tell him i'm done working and I am going home and ask for him to return so I can pick up my tennis shoes from his truck and give him hotel room key. He does come back and throws my shoes at me from the window of the truck and they gets out and starts getting in my face like he is about to assault me. I hand him the room key and start walking away while he continues to yell across parking lot making threats.

&#x200B;

Thankfully I was able to be picked up and taken home and got a great job working for a school district for better benefits and $15K more per year.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Boss pressured me about religion and then got so drunk he wanted to commit a felony with me in car. Quit right then and walked into better job with better pay.",2019-05-17 16:26:27
Extreme Coupon Catastrophe,60,bo4eb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bo4eb9/extreme_coupon_catastrophe/,15,1557758856.0,"Hi! I'm Tim(All I can give is a nickname sorry) and I work at Walmart as a cashier. I haven't been working long, as I'm currently on my second month of employment. The story I'm about to tell is about what was I believe to be my 4th week on the job. I had just gotten off my training and was finally able to work by myself. Since it was my first day without a trainer, they put me on the 20 items or less Register. BEST. PLACE. EVER. There were basically no customers since it was the near end of that month(I applied on an odd day so I got hired near the midpoint of that month.) It was Awesome! People had more than 20 items and the bagging wheel was small, but I made it work. It was all running smooth until the end of my shift. I see 2 women with a HUGE cartfull of stuff at the end of my lane. I was super confident I could bag their stuff... The problem was their conversation. It goes as follows...

Lady 1(L1):Wanna go to this register?

Lady 2 (L2):Aw wait no it's 20 items or less.

L1:Wait does self checkout do coupons?

There was a sign on all self checkouts saying they do. I actually didn't know this at the time as I never paid attention to that till after this day. They walk up to my register and I immediately get ready to scan!

L2: Hey do you know if the self checkout does coupons?

Me:Oh...um...I actually don't know. I think they might but I'd have to ask the Customer service manager. She's actually over there.
I point directly at the CSM, who was talking to someone. They say okay and go towards her(I had said I'd go ask but I'm soft spoken at work) they got a half a foot away from her and made a B line for the fucking self checkout. I Was confused at first but shrugged it off and didn't think twice about it. I got a few customers after that and smooth sailing once again. Then they returned... With the CSM... and she was not happy. Ooooh boy.

CSM:Hey Tim did they come to your register?

Me: Ummm yes they did they asked me about self-checkout and I didn't know so I said I'd have to ask you.

CSM: yeah well they said you denied them service. Did you have any customers here at the time?

Me: no ma'am, I didn't (I'm not trying to get fired I just got this job)

CSM:well when you have no customers, you gotta take customers with more than 20 items (gives me the""play it off"" look)

Me, putting on my best act : I'm So sorry I thought you were only asking me a question! I can help you now.

L1: well for some reason our coupons aren't working. We got em online and they should work

CSM: are they printouts? 

Both ladies: yeah

She asks for them to hand her the coupons and she looks em over. This is where I learned something about online coupons. When you print them out they have the same barcode and a serial number so you can differentiate the copies of coupons for the same item. They also have a kind of subcode to differentiate the copies of the same coupon for the other set of copies. My CSM tells them this and starts sorting the ones they can use with the ones they can't. All the whipe the two are talking not paying attention. It went something like this...

L1:ugh I can't believe this. I don't understand why they aren't working.

L2:this is rediculous they should all work. We shoulda went to[Other Walmart]

Suddenly A friend from College(if you see this you know who you are. Luv yu Batch!) and her current Boyfriend show up and see me and wave and keep shopping.they'll come back later. Meanwhile, CSM finished sorting them and leaves the unusable coupons on the bagging wheel and the usable ones in front of the ladies. She tells me which ones are which and dips because she got manager stuff. the ladies stop chattering and grabs the coupons. 

L1:Is she done sorting my coupons?

Me:yes ma'am those are the ones you ca-
The other lady grabs the unusable coupons. She starts looking through them and sees the subcodes are different. She starts comparing them with the usable coupons.

L2:these aren't the same

L1:yeah they have different serial codes

They then reshuffled ALL of the coupons and hand them back to me. I now have to scan all of their groceries before doing the coupons. They decided to only get half of what they originally bought. So I scanned what they said and they start pushing the coupons on me. They kept popping up $$(that's an error code meaning they don't work) and most of what I scanned for was for the items they didn't want. Let me inform you that they didn't organize how they bagged the groceries. I had to unbag them, rescan them and rebag them in NEW bags. This was when my friend came back to see this and both her and her bf got annoyed and apologized that they were goin to self checkout. Meanwhile,as I'm STILL  scanning coupons I hear...

L2: He's not even paying attention.

L1:This is rediculous. I don't get why we gotta wait so long. Let's just go.

Me:I'm sorry they're just not working. I can override what I can(which I did. In fact I gave them a couple coupon discounts for 4 bucks when it was 2)but I can't get all of em

L1:Just give me my coupons and we'll just go.

I gave them the coupons and they leave. WHAT THE FLYING FIDGETY FUCK! Now I'm stuck with the purchase and I can't cancel. Here's the ""best"" part... I look down at the clock and I'm 10 minutes past the end of my shift. I freak out so hard! Not only do I have to get the CSM to cancel the transaction AND take all those groceries to the Customer service area, but I'm late to leave on my first real day on the job. Luckily I got paid for it, but god damn it I'm never using a coupon again I don't care how much it saves.

Why I Quit a Job By Not Showing Up,90,bmekki,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bmekki/why_i_quit_a_job_by_not_showing_up/,3,1557370280.0,"TL;DR: manager who would brag about history of physical violence went off on me and sent me home early, so i never went back, then a few months later she was fired for pinning her boss against a wall.

&#x200B;

I had a horrible manager when I worked fast food. She was I think 26, had a kid when she was 15/16, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but how she acted at work and the things she spoke about made me a bit worried for her son's welfare. 

First day working with this manager, she brags about choking her boyfriend out. This boyfriend isn't the father of her child, which doesn't matter other than the fact she talks about them getting into physical fights all the time, but also cries when her apparently well-off baby daddy wants custody. I understand no mother wants their kid taken away, but I could 100% understand why the father's child would rather care for him. But, I was a minor, and didn't want to ""snitch"", so to speak. She never mentioned harming the child, and never mentioned her boyfriend harming him either.

Managers get drug tested when they get the position, but not afterwards. So she would leave for 15-20 minutes at a time to smoke pot in her car and come back not knowing how to do anything. And I mean, I was in high school, so it's not like I didn't enjoy smoking, but that was an afterwork activity for me, not an at work activity. I think if she had been competent when high, it would not have been as big of a deal, but she was barely competent sober, so I had to do her job and mine when she smoked.

Now, when the store is slow and there are a lot of employees, instead of sending someone on a long break, she would just send people home. Me being good at my job (not trying to brag though, I just took it super seriously even though it was just fast food), I was always one of the people she would keep until I legally HAD to leave. We have a small music festival where I live, and the place I worked was one of few places opened late, so often we would get super busy really late, like cars wrapped around because we only had 2-3 people working. 

One of the nights, my manager got super stoned right before they hit. She stuck me on drive through, my worst position in the store because I have anxiety and talking to people just messes me up, so when I have to do it speedily I can break down. I forgot a car's drink and because they had to wait, I decided to take them out while taking another person's order. I was about to do that, when my manager just flipped on me. She asked me what I was doing, and I explained to her what I was doing. She then went off and said if I couldn't do drive through, to make the food. I was happy to do that; she was slow with the food, I was fast with the food. We would've been a bit less backed up if I was there the whole time, but she was high and didn't want to deal with people. I put the headset down, but because I was shaking it seemed like I slammed it even though my anxiety was fucking me up. She then yelled at me more and cussed me out saying that she didn't get that job to deal with attitude, when I was just doing what she told me to. 

I'd like to mention that our lobby was open at this time as well, so there were people inside watching this happen because the store was set up so they could see what we did in the back (so they know their food isn't being like tampered with or something). Some guy was just smiling like ""of course"", and since I have pretty bad social anxiety, that, paired with being yelled at, I started crying. She told me to go home and I immediately tried to call the store manager, but she was asleep and her boyfriend picked up and sounded angry. The next day my mom tried to call the district manager, the one who had the ability to fire and hire the managers, but he didn't do anything. So, I just didn't show up for any of my other shifts. Knowing she had a history of physical violence, and that i'd have to work with her every night I worked, I just couldn't. I kept telling myself I'd give an actual letter of resignation, but I never did. 

A few months later the other managers would call and text me telling me to come back. I learned that the problematic manager was fired for pinning up the store manager against a wall. 

I should also mention she had zero qualifications to be a manager. Her only prior job experience was as a stripper.",2019-05-09 05:51:20
Multi management complaint over apple cider,47,bkur12,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bkur12/multi_management_complaint_over_apple_cider/,10,1557038422.0,"I live in the west coast and work for a specialty liquor store called bevmo, aside from alcohol we sell non-alcoholic odds and ends, this leads into my first work place related customer complaint since I started here. I was stocking beer coolers when a customer came to me asking ""do you have apple cider?"", I usually look or ask if im not sure, but being distracted with my task at the time I replied ""Off the top of my head I don't think we sell that"", she walked off and I went back to my task.

Not even one minute later, she pulled me aside and told me how terrible my customer service was, all because my other co worker had rightly informed her we sell apple cider and showed her where it was. she followed with how unprofessional I was and made me follow her accross the store to see where the product was, and said I had no business working here if I cant do that.

If that wasn't enough, she made it clear that she would report me to management and corporate for my ""combative"" behaviour, which was me nodding and agreeing with her decisions and statements, still berating me of course. This was followed by her requesting a manager/supervisor on shift to tell them the same thing, with me present after I phoned them in.

When she finally started to leave towards check out she requested corporate contact while making a purchase to make sure they know, all because I was honest with her from my store knowledge while distracted. Later learned co-workers at my store have had something just as stupid complained against them at some point, helped with my mood post incident. Life is full of endless possibilities it seems when dealing with customers.",2019-05-05 09:40:22
Jerk boss,31,bj80v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bj80v2/jerk_boss/,0,1556655361.0,"For my second last job, i had a jerk boss.
Here are some stories:

1. Harassment

I am a female, was in my 20s. He was in his late 40s. Once in a while, when work was slow, he used to call me over in his office, gossipping people or talk about his personal life. Sometimes he closed the door, started to talk about his sex life, that i wouldn't wanna know. 
I wasn't sure what to say or what reaction that I was supposed to make. But it was very uncomfortable hearing about your boss's sex life in closed door. I just kept this to myself long after i quit this job. But whenever i think about this, i feel like it was a form of sexual harassment.


2. Bad mouthing & ignoring me

I made a mistake - i found this out later. I apologized and tried best i could to fix the issue. And it was first big mistake i made when i was working for him. But he bad mouthed me in front of all people he knew. My previous manager before him within the same company & team later asked me if i was okay. I mean, okay sorry i wasn't aware the issue, but you could just quietly have a conversation with me rather than going to everyone else and started to blame me.
Also after this incident, he completely ignored me for two whole weeks - he gave me the look everytime he pass by my desk and not talking to me at all (not even saying hi).


3. Cursing me(?)

There were a lot of issue with the department itself and with him as well, and i was offered a job in my previous team, so i accepted that even though it was a lower position. Working for him was so stressful so i didn't care about money, needed to move on for my own sanity. When i told him i will move on after two weeks, he started his words. 
He was basically saying that i am too weak and unqualified for any job, incompetent and so that i will not be successful in anything that i will do, it will be a waste of time and money to study for accounting designation so don't even bother. 
It was harsh words but didn't hurt me cuz i knew what he was gonna say. I went down to my friend in my previous department and told her what he said, and manager who was just passing by overheard the conversation and he got furious. I was told to stay there don't even bother go back to my desk. He will call over the facility and IT team to grab my stuff. So i ended up moving back to my previous team on that same day.

I can add a lot more stories about him if anyone is upfor more stories about jerk boss.",2019-04-30 23:16:01

Two of the dogs currently boarding there are a brother and sister, some kind of pointer hunting dogs, and they're older. The girl dog is mostly blind (she can see shadows and shapes, but that's about it) so she has trouble navigating. Luckily, she has her brother to help her.

He's such a good dog, and a total sweetheart. He guides her to their food and water, makes sure she doesn't run into anything or fall over (her balance isn't the best), helps her up onto their bed, and so much more.

To-day he did the sweetest thing I've ever seen. I let the two of them out into one of the outside yards so they could go potty (sorry, that's the term we have to use round the dogs), and he guided her out, found level ground for her to stand on, then stood at her side and let her lean against him so she could lift her leg to potty without fear of falling over.

They both got treats and bellyrubs after potty time.

(Sorry, I know this is kind of a weird and awkward story, but I just think it's so sweet!)",2019-04-27 21:38:36

I'm working until we close.,70,bf7vsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bf7vsh/im_working_until_we_close/,6,1555730238.0,"At the beginning of the week, I predicted to a co-worker that about 2 hours before close of business, whoever is the keyholder on Friday would come around trying to get everybody to leave early for the holiday weekend.  Further I predicted that no attempt would be made to get people to flex their work hours in advance, so that employees who count on a regular schedule and a full work week on their pay check could both leave early and get their hours in.  I was confident of this because it happens nearly every holiday.

It is possible to flex about two hours extra work time *per day* at this job.  By giving so much as same-day in the morning notice, we can flex a full hour in our schedules.

Fast forward to today, about an hour and a half before close of business.  The keyholder came around asking if we all wanted to go home, mentioning that it was a lovely day out and wouldn't it be nice to go do stuff outside instead of working?  

I told them if they wanted to give me 1.5 hours worth of cash on the spot, I'd leave early.  I mentioned that even a day's notice would have been enough to make sure I could have flexed my schedule enough to leave early without having to worry about getting a full pay check.    After 5 minutes of arguing, the attempt was abandoned and they retreated to the front office.

In theory, we are supposed to test our emergency announcement public address system every week.  The keyholder played the Baby Shark song and some other annoying kids' song for like 15 minutes trying to drive us out.  Two of us danced instead and had a pretty good time actually.  One of the guys was about ready to run screaming from the room until we got him to laugh at the trolling from the front office.",2019-04-20 06:17:18
Problems with gatekeeping/ entitled secretaries.,97,be66rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/be66rh/problems_with_gatekeeping_entitled_secretaries/,7,1555497043.0,"I've just read a gatekeeping post on another sub and it reminded me of a not so fun call I had once. A few years ago I worked as a 'business adviser', my job was essentially to help small businesses in England set up apprenticeships. It was a government provided service, all free for the employers so I worked through many requests each day and didn't have much time to waste. 

&#x200B;

I received an email one morning from a manager in a hospice/care centre type place asking for a call about 11am to discuss his options regarding hiring an apprentice. This was the call, paraphrased from memory:

&#x200B;

Gatekeeper: Good morning, this is Hospice, how can I help?

&#x200B;

Me: Hi, It's Charlie calling from Service, can I speak to Mr Smith please? 

&#x200B;

Gatekeeper: Is he expecting your call?

&#x200B;

Me: He should be, he emailed me this morning asking for a call about 11.

&#x200B;

Gatekeeper: I highly doubt that.

&#x200B;

Me: I'm sorry, what?

&#x200B;

Gatekeeper: I highly doubt Mr Smith would have emailed YOU. 

&#x200B;

Me: (getting a bit irritated) I'm not sure what you mean. I'm looking at his email now, it definitely says 11am. Is now not a good time? I have some availability about 3pm if that would be a better time to call.

&#x200B;

Gatekeeper: I will NOT be transferring you to Mr Smith. He doesn't want what you're selling. 

&#x200B;

Me: I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding, I'm not selling anything. I work for Service. Mr Smith emailed me earlier as he wants some help with getting an apprentice or two.

&#x200B;

Gatekeeper: We're not hiring any apprentices so I know you're lying. Do NOT call again.

&#x200B;

Me: He really did email \*dead tone\*

&#x200B;

So I emailed Mr Smith, explained the situation and advised I unfortunately would not be able to call him again as I would not speak to Gatekeeper due to her unprofessional behaviour. He sent me his mobile number, apologised and asked for a call back. He was a lovely man to talk to and I enjoyed working with him. 

&#x200B;

I just don't understand why some secretaries are so aggressive and rude. I probably had a few calls like this every month, which doesn't sound like many, but it shouldn't happen at all. Manners are free, there's no excuse for rudeness.",2019-04-17 13:30:43
Eventful Overnight Shift,38,bdflvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bdflvt/eventful_overnight_shift/,2,1555332699.0,"So tonight at work some girl came in and firstly tried to take cups by leaning over the counter so I went and stopped her. She said she needed like 4 drinks (which was funny to me since it was just her and a dude in the car since they came through drive thru first) I said sure, they're 1.09 each. She asked if she could have them for free and I said no, and that I can only give her some water for free. She went on and on about it and if she could have some more griddles, I kept telling her no. 

She eventually walked off but then came back a few minutes later. Started asking me if I was gay, and how she knew some gay guy who she was trying to help find a nice guy for. I told her i have a boyfriend, her sucking up and making conversation wont make me give her a free drink. She left again. 

A few minutes later the guy who was in the car with her came in asking if that girl had come back in and how he does know her but was just helping her out and thinks she was drugged or something. He leaves. About an hour or so later we find out that the soap dispensers in both the men and womens room were Gone. As in off the walls and no where in the bathroom. One of our cooks said he heard noises from the bathroom when that girl was there, so we assume it was her.

A few more hours pass and we find out she had also dumped a bunch of trash out in the womens room and had poured the soup into the mens toilets. 

So long story short, we no longer have soap in the bathrooms.",2019-04-15 15:51:39

The other day, one of the puppies was crying (I can only assume because of the wind). Not even his mama and siblings were able to comfort the poor dear. So I went into the area where the puppies and their mama are being kept, and -- after letting the mama dog thoroughly investigate me -- sat down with the crying puppy in my arms.

After a few minutes of me scratching his belly and letting him suck on the end of my braid (he didn't want to chew on it, just wanted to hold it in his mouth), he fell asleep. When I set him down next to his mama and siblings, he snuggled right in, happy as could be.

How I underhandedly quit my last job.,65,bcg5lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bcg5lb/how_i_underhandedly_quit_my_last_job/,2,1555089499.0,"I had been with my previous job for nearly 5 years and near the end I was becoming increasingly more depressed and ultimately desperate. 

I had spent so long working as hard as I could for these people only to be stuck in limbo land continuing to make shit pay. I had managed to work my way into this odd position of superiority, but not. I was a trainer, an assistant lead for the main line, cross trained in every minor department within the main department and was a foremost expert on the main product and it's assembly, at the time of my departure I was an interim lead twice over, and I was well respected and appreciated across the entire company. 

However, when I started there was less than 15 people in my main department and fast forward nearly 5 years, there's almost 50. I was in this odd floating position working for a medical device manufacturer and I was only making $12.50 an hour after nearly 3 years of service. 

I finally worked up the gumption to demand a raise because I had a few reasons to know I deserved it: 1) There were temps being hired on permanent for $15 an hour and 2) I had moved out to preserve my sanity against my emotionally abusive father and I was trying to afford rent and utilities (with two other roommates!) that was taking 3/4 of my take home income to pay, so I knew there was a massive issue, and 3) I was one of the most qualified, experienced, and senior most persons in that clean room. So when I went up to my boss to ask, his response was more or less, ""See, I know that already! We're working on a fix! Just trust us!"" and so, after 9 months of waiting (and seeing as I was financially locked into where I was living) I was bumped to $15 an hour... the same as the new hires. 

I sucked it up because looking for other work would mean having to move and I couldn't justify it at this point and I was offered some tantalizing opportunities- I was hired as a temporary leader for a product rework and if anything, that just turned into another nail in the coffin. Almost immediately I was being chastised for my leadership style because I wasn't pushing volume fast enough and product wasn't my main concern- my people were. I didn't care if they were temps, they were *my* people and they deserve respect. However, by the end, my shift was the only one that was producing goods not flagged by QC every day (seriously). 

My team also had a timer that predicted the day the work would run out, which predicted late Monday, but there were rumors of other work so I would go up the chain of command begging people to be honest and tell me, because it wasn't a hard question to answer- Yes or no? 

Unfortunately, no one came to talk to my team and my exact words to them where, ""I will never lie to you. And my answer is that, I still don't know."" My team worked that Friday night, shut down the line, gave me a hug and a thank you card along with contract terminations. I ended up going home and drinking myself to sleep with a bottle of wine that night. 

At this point I'd had enough and decided there was nothing for me out here in New England and wanted to move back to where I was from - the west coast. I was granted a small wage increase for my stint as interim lead for the rework, and my tax return was pretty good, which turned into money I socked away in a neat few grand I would use for this adventure and I was getting ready to go and planned to leave late summer. 

I remember shortly after I was offered the position of lead for an up and coming 2nd shift that was to be installed and I refused and explained my plans. My boss was gutted and it turned into months of him begging me not to go, but that's not the main story. 

What happened was, they had 2 manufacturing lines, one with new technology, and they decided the new college graduate mechanical engineer who'd only been with us for 6 months would develop and lead these teams. After 3 months production was still in the shitter and he threatened to walk if he wasn't put back on first, so I was hurriedly put in his place and met with teams that still had no idea how to access work instructions, weren't fully trained or integrated, oh and I had to train a new permanent lead on top of everything. 

I managed to do it in only about 4 months, however the straw that broke the camel's back was when I was told I'd be put back on first, even though both teams and the new lead begged for me to stay. The lead I had trained still wasn't comfortable taking over just yet, and the manufacturing teams still relied on me for assistance. However I was told it was a travesty on first shift and I was needed. What I was met with was two lines shut down for part stock outs that'd been in place for a week, and would continue for 2 more weeks. 2 weeks I could have still been on second, actually doing something instead of playing on my phone. 

In that period I would screwed by the great karma bird of the universe. My roommate who owned the house decided to take back over for her and her fiance and I was stuck moving back home. My brother owns the house and as I would learn that mom and dad weren't keeping up on rent payments, so I had to help them out to prevent forclosure and my commute went from 7 minutes, to 1hr5min in a car that at the time I didn't know needed a short block. Within 3 months my savings went to my brother and my gas tank meaning my thoughts to go west evaporated. 

I knew I couldn't stay with this company for very much longer. It was managed poorly, my primary boss had started going out of her way to treat me like a child and the company wouldn't listen to my complaints because she'd just been diagnosed again with cancer, so the sympathy was on her. Not to mention, I was still getting paid less than some new hires. 

I ended up finding a prestigious manufacturing company nearby my house and applied, and was hired same day as my interview. I will never forget the woman who conducted the QA portion of the interview stopped me on my was to the door and told me she decided she didn't want to wait, and wanted me to start right away. It was the greatest feeling ever. 

The best feeling however, was hauling my supervisor and my boss into a meeting. They were excited, they knew what was up, partially. So I told them, my plans to go west had vanished and they became elated, until I handed in my 2 week notice and they became still and pale. 

Needless to say, I had 4 exit interviews which was mostly people begging for me not to go, but my mind was made up and I finally left. 

It was the best decision ever and I couldn't be happier with my new company.",2019-04-12 20:18:19

big dogs need hugs too,89,bbg08j,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/bbg08j/big_dogs_need_hugs_too/,7,1554858681.0,"I work at a dog kennel. One of the dogs we're currently boarding is a great dane named Leo. Leo is, as his breed would suggest, a very big boy, but he still loves to give hugs to everyone, including those smaller than him (and I am definitely smaller than him).

When I went into work the other day, Leo was in one of the outside yards to go potty (sorry, that's the term we use because it's the most most commonly used term amongst dog owners or something like that). When he saw me, he sat down like a good boy and started wagging his tail so hard that I was almost afraid it would break off.

So I went into the yard Leo was in, told him to stay, got myself in a sitting position that would keep me from being injured (I wasn't injured during this encounter, but if I had been, it would have been a complete accident on Leo's part), and called him over. Leo immediately trotted over and put one leg over my shoulder to pull me close.

After the hug, I got lots and lots of doggy smoochies. It was a great way to start my work day!",2019-04-10 04:11:21

Getting angry isn't going to change the height requirement.,84,b8thb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/b8thb5/getting_angry_isnt_going_to_change_the_height/,7,1554265619.0,"So, a little backstory: I work at a water ride at a world famous theme park. Like all thrill rides, we have a minimum height requirement in order to ride, which is in place for safety reasons. Also like all theme parks, this leads to ""wonderful"" parents getting angry at us employees, even though it's something that's out of our control (contrary to popular belief, ride manufacturers are the ones who set the height requirements, not the parks themselves. We're just the ones stuck with enforcing it).

So, anyway, I was working Grouper (the person at the end of the line that asks you how many people are in your party, and then tells you which row to go to) with a coworker. We start filling the next boat, and the first family in line has a kid that looks short, so I ask him to come over to the height stick to check. My coworker measures him and sure enough, he's under the height requirement. Not just barely, either, but by a good few inches. This kid's family wasn't going to have it. They all, like it was instinct or something, start dog-pilling my coworker with shitty, rude comments. One older woman, presumably the kid's grandmother (who will be henceforth known as ""Karen"" for the rest of this story because I like being cliche), is the loudest and rudest out of all of them. Thankfully, our supervisor was standing nearby so she took over for my coworker so we could fill our boats while she settled things with them.

Well, ""settled"" is kinda a loose term here. After the family gets even more pissed because our supervisor told them the same thing we told them (he's not tall enough to ride, sorry) all of them besides Karen decide to ride the ride while Karen waits with the kid. That would be the end of it, right? Lol nope. My supervisor tries to defuse the situation by offering child swap (where Karen can ride after the rest of the family gets off, without having to wait in line again) but that just won't do. ""I don't care about that!!! I WANTED to ride with HIM!!! This is UNACCEPTABLE!!! Why are you doing this to him?!?!?"" She's legit screaming right in my supervisor's face in front of a huge line of other guests, causing a huge, childish scene.

She must've gone on for about 10 minutes, during which she used all the cliched, height-requirement-hating-parent lines:

""He's with me!!! Why can't I just hold onto him?!?"" Because that's not how it works.

""He's 4 years old! That should be good enough!!!"" It's a *height* requirement, not an *age* requirement, genius.

""You don't understand because your not a mother!!!"" Putting aside how she could possibly know whether or not my supervisor is a mother (she's not, but still), I didn't know you actually had to have kids in order to be neglectful about their safety.

The old classic ""You've just ruined our vacation!!!"" Riiiiiiggggghhht, and having your grandkid go flying out of the boat and getting seriously injured *wouldn't* have ruined your vacation?

And my personal favorite: ""We should've gone to *insert rival theme park across town here* instead! And after this, we *WILL* be going there from now on!"" That rival theme park across town? Yeah, several of their most popular rides have a height requirement that's even higher than ours. They're not gonna let him on those, either. I know from firsthand experience: I have a pass to that rival theme park, and I saw an equally shitty parent scream at an employee at the front of one of *their* rides before because their little kid clearly wasn't tall enough.

Eventually, my supervisor took Karen over to a more private area because of the scene she was making, and after she wasn't getting through to her, she sent her to customer services. Little did Karen know, the supervisor then went to call customer services and explained the situation to them. So I don't know how they're gonna handle it, but I sincerely hope they don't kiss her ass and coddle her for being mad at a very strict park policy that we get in serious trouble for not following.

tl;dr - A toddler isn't anywhere near tall enough for a water-thrill theme park ride, his grandma then proceeds to act like *she's* the toddler towards my supervisor about it.

Use pure Stripping Component on a wax floor? Right...,65,b5x8pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/b5x8pb/use_pure_stripping_component_on_a_wax_floor_right/,0,1553644449.0,"This is a tale I was a witness to but effected a couple of my coworkers (and should have ended worse for someone). Also, be warned, I am composing this on my mobile phone.

Cast: BB (Bitch Boss)
CW1: Co-worker 1 (good worker)
CW2: Co-worker 2 (the tool)

A few years back I was working for a particular school district as a Custodian. It was the first summer cleaning at this school for BB. Now, she felt she had something to prove and wanted to strip the wax out of our band area (which had only been buff and scrubbed for 6 years prior to that date). However, she immediately ran into trouble. 

Apparently, different types of wax had been overlapped and the stripping component we were using at the time was not working very well. A lot of wax remained after the first and second stripping passes and time was burning. After the second pass she decides in her infinite wisdom to disregard the instructions and fill a 55 gallon trash can to the brim with undiluted wax stripping component.

Now, for those who are unaware, wax stripping component is extremely caustic and can deglove your skin if left in contact for too long. And that's when it is diluted at the proper 3 to 1 ratio this particular mix demanded for ""heavy"" stripping. CW1 protests this saying it will not help and is, frankly, dangerous. CW2 says to her he'll do it regardless, and CW1 is more or less ordered to follow her instructions.

Well, as most readers now can imagine, this ended poorly. Both CW1 and CW2 got splashed a bit by the undiluted stripper. CW1 gets the worse of it and ends up leaving to visit the doctor. As it turns out, he was suffering from mild skin irritation from exposure to the stripper (lucky it wasn't worse) and got the rest of the day off but had to apply prescription oitment and avoid further exposure. CW2 never complained, but he may have suffered the same.

BB is furious this did not work out (at no one in particular, mind). The undiluted stripper worked worse than the diluted solution and now she could be in trouble. She then had CW2 dump all 55 gallons of this component down a Storm Drain. If I had known better at the time, I am fairly certain I could have reported that as felonious dumping.

The end result sadly was no one got punished, although the central office had ""words"" with her and got her instruction from the head of maintenance personally. I, sadly, worked under this incompetent for more years and have many more tales to share.

But, as is said, those are stories for another day.",2019-03-27 01:54:09

drunk naked guy asks me to order him pizza and eat with him.,29,b4wiex,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/b4wiex/drunk_naked_guy_asks_me_to_order_him_pizza_and/,3,1553435291.0,"TL:DR: drunk guest at the hotel turns up half naked at the reception multiple times asking for pizza and to eat with me, while constantly asking question.

&#x200B;

So a lil back story. I quit my retail job about a year ago which i got cause my aunt and sister worked there. Now i'm working as a receptionist at a hotel, also because my sister worked here. Basically every time she quit they need someone to replace her and she mentions me.

&#x200B;

CO = co worker (in her mid 30s), ME = me (18), NM = naked man (28 - he told me)

So any way, this happened 5 minutes ago.

&#x200B;

Earlier in the day i was sat in the reception when i hear one of the housekeepers (CO) yell at me to come next to apartment 3. (our hotel is quite small, so during the weekends when i work its only me at reception and 1-2 housekeepers - that's how small we are although we have 16 hotel apartments which all have a living room, 1+ bedrooms, kitchen and toilet). So i go up and see a hat and a wallet in-front  of the apartment door. CO jokingly said that the guy must've started getting undressed in the corridor (we both laugh.... oh boy), she wanted me there to see that it was on the floor before she touched it in case the guest started shit like stealing money or something. So she micks it up knocks on the door and this happens (while the door is closed):

NM:...yes.,..

CO: hi you must've dropped your wallet or something.

N: ...oh.... (and some other words)

some other words were exchanges - can't remember cause my memory is shit.

so NM opens the door, and is butt ass naked, with only his hand holding a small towel in front of his crotch. he takes his shit and closes the door. me and Co just kinda look at each other and laugh a bit.

&#x200B;

So now back to 5 mins ago.

&#x200B;

im sitting at the desk browsing through social media cause i was hella bored and i hear NM coming down the stairs. Still hella naked but this time with a robe around him. How-fucking-ever. It wasn't properly fastened at the front, so there was this 1 inch or so slit down the middle that exposed him. Now, the only reason I didn't see his junk was because he was african american with rather dark complexion and the reception has weirdly darkish lighting - thank fuck for that, otherwise my precious eyes would've been tainted - doesn't help that i'm anxious as shit and don't really wanna see dick when i'm trying to mind my own business, So this is how the convo ensues:

&#x200B;

NM: hi could you order a pizza for me?

ME: (*b-but u can just do that from ur room tf)*, ye sure, you have a specific company u want like dominos or pizza hut?

NM: no, you choose

ME: ok

NM: What kinda pizza do u like?

ME: no sorry i dont want anything

NM: no no, what kind of pizza do u like

ME:oh i dont really eat pizza

NM:no!? what do u eat

ME: (*i either say 'i dunno' or murmur something)*

Then we have a convo of me basically asking what pizza he wants, him saying he doesn't mind and thta i should pick, no sides or anything.

he then asks me if i want anything so im like nah dawg im good cause i just ate a massive bowl of instant ramen noodles.

so anyway i ask whether he wants to pay cash or card, says card then remembers that he left his card upstairs so walks painfully flow to get it. Comes back and this happens:

ME: \*turns the reception desk monitor and keyboard towards him\*

NM: no no you type it in. i trust you, i dont trust many people but i trust you.

\*me proceeds to type in card details\*

NM: sorry im all naked and stuff

ME: \*tries to ignore that statement and finish typing shit into the computer

NM: so how old are you?

ME: 18

NM: 18?! wow. I'm 28. when i was 18 i was getting ready for uni.

then a bunch of stuff like how im going to uni and him asking what imma study and stuff.

so i finish and tell him that i can take up the pizza to his room when it arrives and stuff.

&#x200B;

Now at this point when im writing this i had to stop for like 10 ish minutes cause guess who just came down the stair (as im writing from this sentence onwards he left like a min ago).

&#x200B;

NB: \*asks about pizza being late\*

ME: oh ye its been 30 minutes \*Calls the pizza place\* they said the driver has been sat outside for 10 minutes cause i gave the wrong number (whoopsie)

Anyway the pizza finally arrives after like 5 mins of him talking to me about some random Renaissance thing and calling me extremely patient and shit like 3 times,

NM: ill stay here and eat with you

ME: (no wtf dude) ahh sorry no, i just ate lunch so im not hungry

NM: oh, u sure?

ME: ye ye im fine

NM: u ok?

ME: ye ye im good im good

NM: i'll come back later to check up on you

ME: (wtf x100000) no no its fine

NM: no ill come down to check on u if you're ok.

then leaves and slightly trips on the stairs - he's fucking drunk.

edit 1: spelling

edit 2: he also asked me a lot of weird questions like what do i see myself doing in 5 years and where and shit like that.

Please put my empty specimen cup in a bag because I'm embarrassed.,46,b3cq4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/b3cq4t/please_put_my_empty_specimen_cup_in_a_bag_because/,1,1553092306.0,"Can I share my amusing moment of the day from work yesterday? I work as a receptionist for an OB/GYN Doctor's office. 

So when patients come to us for infertility there are several things we do, tests/lab work we run etc. for the patient and if those all come back clear we suggest sending the husband for a semen analysis. The doctor writes the orders for the analysis and we give the patient the orders and a cup and then they go to a different facility for the rest.

Yesterday when I got to work there was a small, clear lab specimen bag on my desk. Inside the bag was a small, empty specimen cup and several papers. I peered at the papers and saw that it was for a semen analysis and assumed a patient would come pick it up. Now, I know that I work for an OB/GYN so I'm used to seeing this stuff but believe me when I tell you there was nothing conspicuous about this bag. There was no way you could see what it was for unless you grabbed the bag and read the orders inside. Anyone seeing a woman walking out of a doctor's office with such a bag in her hands would have thought nothing of it. The Amish patient that came in to pick it up practically whispered to tell me what she was there for. When I handed her the bag she asked me if I have a bag to put it in. I was momentarily taken aback but told her I don't have one and I'll see if the nurses have one. (We are a satellite office so if she would have asked at the main office we would have had  plastic bags with our logo on them.) The only thing they could find for me was a BRIGHT red, trash bag size, biohazard bag with huge biohazard symbols all over it. 

After she left I laughed and laughed at the absurdity of putting an innocent looking bag into a trash bag that screams, ""LOOK AT MEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" You can put money on it that people were wondering what she was carrying around after that. ",2019-03-20 16:31:46

&#x200B;

everyone's like 'wtf does that even mean?'  this is totally bizarre.  at this place there is no seeing if you like it.  either you're there at work for the full eight hours and you're gone after your time is up or you're hired before you even start work.  it's not up to you whether or not you'd like to stay on.  a few of the nosier workers asked her if maybe she's doing a school program where she as to get hours of experience or something but she tells them all she finished school a couple of years ago.  everyone's question then became (privately) whose daughter or niece is she?

&#x200B;

so today she was officially hired on for full time to our shift (even worked a full shift today!) and for my friend who has been a temp for four years that must be a real slap in the face.  i'm trying not to blame the new girl for this because she's not really the one who did this but i can't help resenting her.

So about 4 years ago I worked at this one pizza place in my sophomore year of college, one night (like 9:00pm) we get a call from this one woman, sounded like mid-twenties early thirties and she seems a bit out of it but she orders.

C: caller
Me: me

C: Can I get 2, wait (covers the phone) 2 or three girls? Alright 3 medium cheese pizzas
Me: alright anything else?
C: Oh right, make your hottest delivery boy come too *audible giggling from other people*
Me: Um alright, he will be on his way soon
C: Alright, make it quick

At this point, I'm pretty hung up on the ""hottest delivery boy"" part so I do what they asked (I'm Bi and am out at work so that made it pretty awkward).
HD: Hottest delivery person (I'll explain later) 

Me: Hey uh HD can you go deliver these?
HD: Why me? That address is WAY off my path.
Me: Umm, special request?
HD: Oh? Who from?
Me: Some random lady.
HD: So why ME?
Me: Um the request was for ""hottest delivery boy""

He blushes and says ""Oh"" and takes the pizzas and leaves as fast as possible. An hour passes and he doesn't come back, my manager calls the cops and gives them the address. We get a call like 5 minutes later from the cops saying there were just a bunch of girls there eating pizza, they said he left like 5 minutes ago.

He walks in the door a minute later

HD: You guys will NOT believe what just happened.
Manager: What happened? You had us worried!

HD then tells about how when he got there 4 girls all topless and braless greeted him and you can probably guess the rest.

A couple of months go by and I get a call from the same person with the same requests and also added to choose someone better this time. I get a group of girls together (Co-Workers and friends) to choose one of the hottest guys (Not including the last guy) that worked at our place. Same story.

Every once and a while we would get calls like this from this one woman (I never got picked, idc cause idk where they or my Co-Workers have been) Every once in a while they ask for another girl. We made some rules:
1. Any guy can get picked except the last person who went 
2. If one of the guys gets cold feet there would be a revote
3. No pictures or videos of the night would be taken, if they were, they were not to be shown to anyone at the shop.

After a year or two, they stopped calling. I went to the address and I knocked.
W: the woman that used to be C

Me: Hi! I know this is sorta a weird question but did yo-
W: I know what you are going to ask, I recognize the uniform
Me: O-Oh, alright. I just wanted to check in on you since you used to be one of our most dependable buyers (She didnt always ask for someone, some of the times she just wanted some pizza XD).
W: Oh, right. Every time I called after that group broke up (Group of girls I'm assuming) it reminded me of them and made me sad
Me: Oh, What happened?
W: Ha, some of them moved the others got boyfriends that didn't like what we did. We just fell apart.
Me: I'm really sorry to hear that.

She invites me in and we have a genuine conversation and shes actually really nice. We went on a few dates but we realized we should just stay friends. Thats kinda the end. I lost contact with her last year do to a move and she changed her number for some personal reasons and I forgot to ask for the new one.

Hope you enjoyed!

&#x200B;

I work in small a restaurant as a Dishwasher/Prep Cook/Host. We can seat a total of 68 people, 60 at tables and 8 at the bar. We lost some host's/hostess's to the new restaurant that opened next door earlier this year. They had more convenient hours for them.

&#x200B;

Just last week we got one new hostess (shes 19 and has that look of ""I don't care""). Their job is to help servers (waiter/waitress), clean tables and put dishes in to bus tubs. We use two types of cleaners in the restaurant, bleach based and ammonia based.  On her first day, one of the waitress's was showing where the cleaners were, what we use up front and more importantly, not to mix bleach and ammonia. 

&#x200B;

We have two different colored buckets for them too. 8 blue buckets that are used for bleach and 2 red buckets used for ammonia. Only two bleach buckets are allowed to be up front at a time (They are well away from the customers and out of view hidden next to where we keep bus tubs). We only allow 2 so that people do not smell bleach while they eat, as i mentioned earlier, small restaurant. We have one of the red buckets in the back fulled with a bit of ammonia so we can just go clean the bathrooms every 2-3 hours with out having to make a new solution every time. yes, i know, bad idea in hindsight. 

&#x200B;

Today we had to close at 10am, just 2 hours after we opened. The new hostess, who had this explained to her multiple times decided to make a third bleach bucket in the red bucket WITHOUT even dumping it out. I was on dish duty today so I was around the corner from where she was, but I could hear her complaining about the ""bleach smell"" burning her nose.

&#x200B;

It did not even take a minute before the waiter on duty was calling me up front because because he could smell something weird. I walked up front and got a whiff of that burning strong bleach smell that comes with fucking chlorine gas. 

&#x200B;

We had a single table on the other side of the restaurant by one of our exits. The cook rushed them out with a free meal voucher and I ran around opening all the doors and windows (its fucking cold by the way) to air the place out and the waiter dumped the bucket. The cook called our boss, who told us to shut it down for the day. 

&#x200B;

The hostess was outside the back door. I went to talk to her.

Hostess: ""So I can go home now right?""

&#x200B;

This pissed me off so much I ended up exploding, I wish I had not, but sometimes people just make those stupid mistakes. 

&#x200B;

Me: ""ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS? THATS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY? YOU MADE CHLORINE GAS!""

&#x200B;

Hostess: ""I'm sorry, I didn't know.""

&#x200B;

Me: ""YOU KNEW NO TO USE THE RED BUCKET FOR BLEACH!""

&#x200B;

Hostess: ""I FORGOT!""

&#x200B;

Me: ""THIS IS A SMALL RESTAURANT! THIS GAS COULD HAVE FUCKING KILLED SOMEONE IF WE WERE BUSY DUMBFUCK!""

&#x200B;

At this point she started crying and the cook (hes the supervisor) grabbed me and just shook his head.

I was tricked by a puppy,106,b090bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/b090bh/i_was_tricked_by_a_puppy/,7,1552404255.0,"I work at a dog kennel. The other day, one of the puppies (German shepherd, about nine weeks old) was inside in the front room. The front room has a tile floor (but all the dogs in there have blankets or a bed, whichever they prefer), and the puppy seemed to be having trouble standing up on it.

I went into his kennel and helped him stand up, and he proceeds to slide down onto his belly again. This happened over a dozen times before he finally got the hang of standing. By then, it was time for me to leave, so I went and gave all the dogs their preferred good-bye (some like bye-bye hugs, some like to shake, some like a kiss on the top of their head, and so on) then got in my car and headed home.

Later that evening, my boss sent me a video of one of the puppies playing with one of her grandkids. The puppy was running and jumping and having absolutely no trouble staying on his paws on tile. I asked my boss if that was the same puppy who was in the front room earlier, and she said yes.

ME: Then that puppy is a little liarpants, lol.

MY BOSS: Did you get tricked by a dog again?

ME: He acted like he wasn't able to stand up on the tile floor!

MY BOSS: Yeah, he does that when he wants attention.

So yeah. I got tricked by a little fluffball of a puppy. It was nice. Sorry this isn't very well-written; I'm kinda sick right now. I hope you enjoyed anyway!",2019-03-12 17:24:15
"""Support Monkey""",40,azanb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/azanb3/support_monkey/,5,1552181410.0,"It was the release of Captain Marvel. One of the biggest releases of the year. I work box office at one of the biggest theaters in my state, so it was kind of slow as most people already bought their tickets online knowing that the movie will probably be sold out if they go get tickets at box office. Around 7 PM a group of people came out laughing, and told my co-worker that someone brought a monkey to the theater. Confused, we looked around and saw a monkey head peaking out of a backpack that had a glass top for the monkey to see the outside. We laughed it off for a bit, but bringing animals into the theater is against my work's TOS. So I walked over to my nearest manager and told them about the monkey. They seemed confused, but ended up making sure that I wasn't lying.

They walked around to the person with the monkey and sure enough saw the animal looking around in the bag. They called another manager to help out with the case, and after a while walked up to the owner most likely saying that they will have to leave as animals are not allowed in the theater. The manager then came back, and when it stopped being busy I went to the manager and asked whats going on with the monkey. They said that the person yelled at them saying ""It's a support monkey!"" and that we can't do anything about it as it's not against the law. Few hours later the person left captain marvel with the monkey in the backpack, and we moved on with our night.

"Shes just a child, it doesnt matter",7,ayjlzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ayjlzu/shes_just_a_child_it_doesnt_matter/,3,1552003264.0,"This is my first post on one of these subreddit's.

This happened about two years ago in the middle of winter. I work at a restaurant. I started as a dishwasher, and now I am a Host/Dishwasher/Prepcook. A majority of the time I do prep or wash dishes. The other guy who helps me in the back, is usually in charge of the bathrooms, but every now and then my boss has me deep clean them because the other guy is a slacker. The day this happened, was the day I had to clean them.

&#x200B;

This is information I got afterwards from one of the waitresses.

A huge family came in about 30 minutes before I went to clean the bathrooms. They were all well dressed and going to a wedding later on. (I dont know why you would go to a small restaurant in your fancy suits and dresses, but I dont go to weddings so what do I know?) They were a polite group, but were a little bit on the rowdy side. The youngest one there was a girl who was about 14. She was in a very nice dress and was excited. It was her sisters wedding and she was the brides maid.

I saw them all when I went to clean the bathrooms and almost thought about waiting, but decided to ahead because I did not want to wait who knows how long. Both the bathrooms have a single toilet, sink and small mirror. I leave the doors propped wide open when I clean them. You know, a man walking out a locked women's room would not be suspicious at all.

&#x200B;

Around this time, I guess one of the men started goofing off and knocked over a huge water pitcher. The water went all over the young girls dress. I was just finishing up in the ladies room, drying off everything, making sure toilet paper was stocked, etc. I hear some sobbing getting closer and hear the last part of a conversation ""dryer when we get home, it should be done before the wedding"".

&#x200B;

The girl and her mother walk in to the bathroom and I turn around. The mother has our restaurants uniform in her hands, and the girl is in a soaked dress crying. (It was -3f/-19c, so being out side in wet clothing is not the best of idea) The mother looks at me for a second.

&#x200B;

Mother: ""Ohh you are cleaning?""

Me: ""I was just finishing up, but I'll leave and finish later.""

The mother just closed and locked the door.

Mother: ""Just finish up, we arent going to use the toilet.""

I had no clue what to say

Mother: ""You need to put this on, hurry up""

The girl went bright red at this point

Girl: ""Mom, I can't with the cleaner in here!""

Me: ""Ma'am, I cant be in here while women use the room for any reason""

Mother: ""Shes just a child, it doesnt matter.""

Girl: ""Please mom!""

&#x200B;

At that, I got let out of the bathroom.

I told my boss, he just laughed.

Something smells like death,10,ayh8dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ayh8dm/something_smells_like_death/,1,1551990272.0,"(Insert obligatory apology for using mobile)

I have several stories about this job but this one in particular sticks out from the rest.

So some context: I work at a place that makes signs for buildings, vinyl decals, posters for events, and many other things. One of the services we offer is removing vinyl wraps from vehicles. Back in October of 2018 a local pest control company was going through a rebrand and had over 15 fully wrapped pick-up trucks that needed to be done. Over the course of a month our client would drop off a new truck after we'd finished one or were pretty close to finishing.

Characters:

Cw: co-worker

Me: A unicorn

Our client had just dropped off a fresh truck the previous day after my shift. We were pretty swamped with orders at the time so I was the one who did most of the vinyl removal. I grabbed my heat gun along with some other things and set to work out back. About five minutes in and I noticed this stench.

At first I thought it was the vinyl as it tends to smell quite a bit when it is heated up. I shrug it off and continue to peel the vinyl off the truck. I slowly begin to realize that whatever it is I'm smelling is not burnt vinyl. Nope, it smelled more like something was rotting. Gross but whatever, it isn't too powerful so I ignore it the best I can.

A couple of hours in I accidentally knock my scraping tool into the bed of the truck. I go to retrieve it when my hand brushes against some cardstock looking thing the client had left in the bed. As I'm pulling the tool out the motion flips the ""cardstock"" over and the smell intensifies. I looked down and immediately wanted to hurl.

The ""cardstock"" was actually a glue trap and stuck smack in the middle of it was a dead rat. I backed up a bit and took a moment to process what I saw. Apparently the pest control company hadn't thought to remove their used glue traps from the vehicle before they brought it to us. I was disgusted and a little shaken. 

I didn't know what to do with the rat and I couldn't bring myself to touch the glue trap. The fact that I had already touched the thing accidentally did not help at all. I eventually decided to continue to ignore it, I had half an hour until lunch break I'd deal with it later. Eventually cw came out to help me with the truck and I guess he noticed the smell pretty quickly because it wasn't long before I heard him yell something along the lines of ""Dude what the hell?!"" Cue the following conversation:

Cw: Come get a load of this!

Me: I know, it's pretty awful.

Cw: No wonder this truck smells like sh*t. That's disgusting! I can't believe they left this here!

Me: I didn't know what to do with it so I just left it there. You'd think that it would be common courtesy to remove that stuff before pawning it off to someone else.

Cw ended up throwing the glue trap away in a dumpster and we went back to work. I guess our boss must have said something to the client because we didn't run into something like that again. So yeah, moral of the story: don't leave dead rodents in the back of your truck for someone else to deal with.

TLDR: Client drops off a truck and leaves a dead rat in the bed.",2019-03-07 22:24:32
Slowly driving my coworkers insane with coins,132,ayh47z,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ayh47z/slowly_driving_my_coworkers_insane_with_coins/,12,1551989659.0,"Okay this may get a little long and I’m gonna change names but try to bare with me.

About a month ago I walked past two of my coworkers’ desks and over heard one, Jason, ask the other, Kelsey, something. It was along the lines of, “Am I tripping or are there more coins on my desk?”

She didn’t know what he was talking about and besides a little chuckling that was the end of the story. While they were gone on break I went over to Jason’s desk to check out the coin situation. There wasn’t a crazy amount. Just a quarter, a dime, a nickel, and a penny. I didn’t know which ones were the “more” or unexpected ones but when I reached into my pocket and realized I had one of each, I decided to leave them there on his desk. After all, it was just 41 cents.

Even though I tried to walk past them as many times as I could that day I didn’t hear anything else. Maybe he didn’t notice. Maybe I just wasn’t there when he did. But later I overheard Kelsey telling her friend, Becky, about it. That’s when I decided I wanted to keep messing with these kids.
At first I’d just add the .41 to Jason’s pile. He started stacking the coins by denomination. Every day. The same types. Once I left late and left it in a smiley face. Then I started hiding them a little. Under things he’d use. Sometimes a little harder to find. Under an extra monitor. Inside a log book everyone in their area uses. Under a floor mat. Once, I had an extra quarter so I hid it inside Kelsey’s clear pencil sharpener.
I taped it under Jason’s desk. I’d heard Jason’s supervisor tell everyone in his area to go work on something in a different spot. I had some coins taped up in my pocket ready to go. I beat them to the area and left them to be discovered. Jason luckily found them taped to what they were organizing.

Things were getting good. They were talking to their friend, Davis, about it constantly and the three of them were definitely accusing each other of being behind it.Then I taped some quarters under Davis’ desk. He didn’t find those right away so it was pretty fun when he finally did.
Keeping a quarter, a dime, a nickel, and a penny on me every day was getting tougher. I’d have to ask for specific change when I went out and bought things. I finally went to the bank and got a roll of each to keep it going. While I was there, I decided to pick up some dollar coins. They became my new calling card. But I made sure Jason always got the original 41 cents along with it.

I can walk around our warehouse pretty freely and can come in a little early and stay as late as I want so I’ve been throwing them off as far as when it happens.

I’ve started hiding them in their usual seats for lunches and breaks.
They’ve told so many people. Nearly the whole warehouse knows. Leads are trying to figure it out. Our manager is pulling out his hair trying to figure it out but fortunately is into it. I guess I’ve been mostly working in the camera’s blind spots. It’s harder now. Everyone is watching. I can’t stop messing with these kids though. The best part is seeing them tear apart their desks before I’ve hidden anything. Eyeing each other. Turning at every rip of tape.

 I bought my own tape to use. I bought some teen/childrens magazines to cut fun letters out of to make a ransom note style card to be found. I’m leaving the message on a flash card with the number 41 on it.

I’ve already got my money’s worth of enjoyment out of this. I was going to end it, but it’s been too fun.",2019-03-07 22:14:19
dogs love oversized sweaters,116,axb9bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/axb9bs/dogs_love_oversized_sweaters/,4,1551728030.0,"The other day at work, one of the dogs (I work at a dog kennel) was scared because the tornado siren was going off. (There wasn't a tornado, but the siren is tested once a month just to be safe. It only lasts about three minutes, but it's very loud and pretty high-pitched, so it's *super not fun* for dog ears.) Anyway, this one dog -- an absolutely gorgeous chocolate lab, and one of the older girls -- was especially upset by the sirens. I did what I always do when a dog is crying: I went into her kennel and comforted her as best I could.

On that day, I also happened to be wearing my favourite oversized sweater (a grey NASA sweater, super soft, about six sizes too big). I go into the chocolate lab's kennel, sit down, let her know she's welcome to cuddle up on my lap or whatever she wants, and she immediately stuck her nose under the hem of my sweater. I thought maybe she wanted to sniff at the shirt I had on under my sweater (not unusual, dogs want to sniff everything), so I lifted my sweater up a little for her.

She then lunged under my sweater, cuddled up against my chest, and whined until I adjusted her to sit fully on my lap so only her tail (which she was wagging like mad) was visible.

Once the tornado siren test was over, she placed a big ol' slobbery kiss on my neck, then exited my sweater and let me resume my work.

In conclusion, working with animals is the best.",2019-03-04 21:33:50

When they came in, they discovered that the mother didn't have any, but the sister did, so they changed it to her real name, got their treatments and left. A couple of hours later the mother calls, and this is the conversation that ensued:

Mam: I don't have a treatment today, why did I get a message? 

Me: [name] made a booking for her sister, they were going to use one of your prepays but you didn't have any, so they used their own. Sorry for the confusion, I thought you knew they were doing it.

Mam: oh. That's funny, [sisters name] is supposed to be in school... 

Me: Erm.... 

Mam: I usually make her bookings for her and bring her in. Shes supposed to be in school today until [time well after they came in]

Me: ... Did I just get them into trouble? 

Mam: can I make a booking for myself while I have you here?

It's really cold right now (the polar vortex has thankfully passed, but I have poor circulation in my hands, so cold weather is very painful for me), which means I have to be careful when I'm working outside.

But one of the great things about working with dogs is that dogs worry about you. Whenever I come in front working outside, I'll take my gloves off and rub my hands together and breathe on them to try and warm them up more quickly. And there are certain dogs who, upon seeing me doing this, will bark at me until I go into their kennel and let them snuggle the warmth back into my hands.

I mean, I've seen fully-grown dogs throw temper tantrums because I wasn't letting them snuggle me. These dogs don't mess round when it comes to warmth. And they bark at me if I leave before they're done warming me back up!

Caregiving Hell,43,avibz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/avibz6/caregiving_hell/,2,1551301080.0,"It's gonna be a long one, my dudes. Okay, so I want to start off by saying that this incident happened around 4 years ago and took place all within an 8 hour shift. I started as a caregiver for individuals with mental and physical disabilities that hindered them from living on their on. I worked in what was known as ""the girls house"" since the company purchased 4 different houses in an underdevelopment neighborhood. At this time I had 3 residents, 2 of which had Cerebral Palsy and one of which only have mental disabilities. My manager told me that I would be getting an emergency placement in my house since I had an open room (previous resident that lived in the house moved in with family, so I had an opening) and obviously, I had to sit in a meeting going over this individuals diagnosis' and their medications/car routine/ anything else before the moved in. 

So, I had a new resident that we will call Adele (Idk). Adele was around 6'6 and a solid 400-500 pounds. Keep in mind that I am 5'3 and though I'm on the bigger side, I still weigh less than half of her total body weight. So this girl TOWERED over me. 

Everything goes smooth for a few days, only a couple of mental breakdowns and everything was cool. All until the day before my birthday. I come into work at 2:30 as normal and I am immediately greeted with the AM caregiver, the side-help caregiver, and both my manager and my assistant manager in my house. I'm told that Adele is having a serious mental breakdown, is threatening harm, and has refused every single one of her medications. So, I know i'm in for one hell of a shift, especially when they all leave without any warning. 

Thankfully my other 3 residents were on the other side of the house (basically, the house was 2 houses connected together through a hallway.) so she couldn't harm my other residents. Everything is really tense and all for about an hour. She in her room, crying and yelling about random things and throwing all of her items around the room. She comes into the kitchen, where I am standing, trying to go through the paperwork that the AM caregiver left me, detailing how the breakdown started. She crept up behind me and scared me by hovering over my shoulder and asking what I was reading. Obviously, I jump because I wasn't expecting her to be directly behind me and this gives her the opportunity to grab the binder from me and start reading the incident report from the AM caregiver. She gets angry and rips the pages from the bind, holding it over my head as I'm trying to get it from her. She ens up throwing the binder at me and sitting at the kitchen table, angry crying. She starts throwing markers and coloured pencils at me as I'm cleaning up and I have the bright idea to grab the markers and coloured pencils as shes throwing them and lock them in the locked medical cabinet over the stove, which infuriates her even more and she starts ripping frames from the walls and throwing literally anything she can pick up at me. 

I dodge as much as I can and she stops immediately, picking up the wall phone, ripping it from the wall, and carries it to her room, screaming about how shes going to call her mother. So I take this time to call my manager and try to get some input on hat I should do, to which he tells me to try to get her tot take her meds. This ends up being a huge mistake and she promptly tells me to ""shove the meds up my ass and go jump off a cliff.' well okay, then. 

Adele becomes increasingly pissed because her mother will not answer the phone (that's because the cord was ripped from the wall.) and asks if she can use my phone. I had just recently purchased the Iphone 6s plus and really didn't want it destroyed to I said no. Big mistake. At this point, she is throwing more things at me, including couch cushions, the kitchen table, bowls and plates, literally anything she can pick up. She even tried to pick up the TV and throw it at me. The last item she throws is a decorative pillow (thank god it was only a pillow), which I hit out of the way and she runs after it. I run the the other side of the house, closing the door behind me and locking it as shes beating on the door. My other residents are scared and in hysterics. I called my manager and told him to get his ass over here. The banging stopped and I slowly opened the door, and walked silently back to the other side of the house, unlocking the front door and allowing my manager to come in. He literally told me, ""hold it down for 10 minutes, cops are almost here.""

I was denied help in a situation where this resident was actively telling me she was going to kill me. So I did my best, and everything went quiet. She exited her room and calmly walked into the living room, asking if I would until a string from her neck. I asked if she wanted to hurt me and she said no. I tried to untie it but to no avail and I didn't know where any scissors were, nor did I want her to be close to any after threatening to kill me.

He foot was bleeding from kicking her bed frame repeatedly and she allowed me to clean up her foot and bandage it since blood was everywhere. As I was knelled down in front of her, sirens sounded from outside, alerting her of the cops. She kicked me in the chest and started screaming that I was a bitch and she was going to murder me and set the house on fire because I needed to die. 

Cops and paramedics rushed in, throwing open her door and fighting with her to be compliant. A cop asked me if I would talk to her since they couldn't get any info out of her, to which I obliged since there were 8 police officers there and 6 paramedics. The next 6 hours were spent by her righting answers to the cops questions on a piece of paper and me reading it out for them. She refused to talk to them and if I left the room, she became extremely violent. During this 6 hours, she locked me in a closet, slammed the door and had me pinned in a corner while the cops took the door off the hinges, and basically yeeted my across her room because I tried to leave during one of her outbursts. 

After she yeeted me, cops rushed the room and one of the grabbed my arm and dragged me from the room (leaving big ass bruises in the shape of hand prints on my arm for 2 week, thanks Officer.) and was told not go back in the room. I then went outside, smoked a cigarette with a cop, and had to be accompanied around the house by an officer because she kept threatening to kill me, and tried to rush past the cops at me multiple times. She broke a pair of handcuffs and a pair of zip tie restraints and her ex-psychiatrist had to be called in to calm her down so they could get her out of the house and into a cop car. 

I believe she arrested that night after she had left the facility but nothing held because of her mental disabilities and illnesses. Idk. I quit the next day. 

TLDR: a crazy resident essentially tried to kill me, cops were called, she refused to have any contact with police unless I was involved and became violent when I left the room. Locked me in the room and her closet, and was yeeted. I no longer work there.",2019-02-27 22:58:00

Onto the story.

A guy, who I guessed was a new customer, came in and ordered a cheeseburger and large fries. I made it, he left, and the quiet 2:00 am period continued. He didn't even start his car before rushing back yelling for the manager (My grandpa).

""How can I help you, sir?""

""YOUR ASSH\*LE FRYCOOK PUT A DAMN GRAVEL IN MY BURGER!""

My grandpa looked at the burger and there was a giant rock from the gravel parking lot wobbling on top of a tomato. He turned to me with the expected face and looked back to the customer.

""You're really did that? You put a rock on your burger and tried to blame it on that kid?""

""That's what he did! He wants me to break my teeth!"" I couldn't tell whether I should laugh or take a headache pill.

My grandpa has been serving food since he left the military. He isn't stupid, and he was only around 55 at the time so he still had a lot of his wit intact. I felt he knew there was no logical argument would take away this guy's determination.

The man realized he looked like me and said: ""Your siding with him cause you're related! I want to talk to the owner!""

Grandpa glanced to a photo that was literally right next to them. It was his picture with the label ""Owner"" under it.

""THIS IS UNFAIR! I'M CALLING THE POLICE BECAUSE YOU'RE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ME, YOU SKINHEAD!"" My grandpa isn't bald, he just cut his hair into the shortest buzz-cut possible.

He gestured to a camera in the kitchen, pointed at me, and the one in the main room, pointed at them and said: ""Guess where the third one is."" Of course, the last one pointed right at his truck.

The man yelled, threw his burger on the ground, and stormed off. I could see him run over the small American flag next to our street sign, but he clipped the sign itself and a chunk of his bumper fell off. The flagpole was made of a strong spring, so it literally bounced right back up after going under the truck.

That night back home, he asked me to get a good shot from the camera footage of the man's face. I didn't get a good look at him from the kitchen, but he looked like Jontron but three times the weight. There's still a sign with his face saying ""Don't serve boulderman.""",2019-02-25 04:26:28

Later our boss walks in (we share a small office space) and starts making small talk. She then comments how my wings smell good, to which i respond ""well I love a good dry rub.""

"I want her to succeed, but I also don’t...",57,ast3ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ast3ez/i_want_her_to_succeed_but_i_also_dont/,5,1550693593.0,"I spent 4 years at my old work place, they where horrible to me, I was overworked and underpaid.
In my last year they hired an apprentice. 

We got close and I made sure that she wasn’t treated how I was, took her under my wing. Shouldered most of the work, and when she took credit for my work I didn’t mind. 

In that last year I taught her everything I knew in a condensed way, and I know that on her CV she claimed to have done things that I did. But I didn’t mind. 

I finally left that place a few months ago, am now on a much better wage and I’m happy.

The apprentice comes to the end of her apprenticeship and I tell her to look for another job instead of staying at the old place. She agrees.

She gets an interview for a position which is much like my new position. She begs me to help her, so I do. I spend 5 hours coaching her on exactly what my role is, what she should say to them and what she should research. 

She gets the job. And she tells me that her job is near what I’m getting at my new job. Amazing news for her.

I’m not a bitter person in general, I want to do my all to help people. But when I heard about her job I must admit...I felt annoyed. I couldn’t help but feel annoyed and thinking “why is everything so unfair”. 

It’s less directed toward her, and more towards the fact that it took me 20 steps to get to where I am, and because of my actions it only took her 2 steps. 

For me it’s like the information I passed on was learned with a struggle and pain. But she got to use that knowledge to get ahead without really having to work hard for it like I did.

And now I feel like such a bad person for thinking this way. I guess I just wish someone could have helped me the same way, but I know that I’m in this game alone.

TD;LR I helped someone, but now they are doing better than me and I feel guilt about the way I’m feeling.

I have an extremely Clingy coworker,73,aruxgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/aruxgf/i_have_an_extremely_clingy_coworker/,8,1550477004.0,"And she will henceforth be known as Clingy and *boy,* do I have some stories. She is the most selfish, creepy, and passive-aggressive person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting This may as well be the introduction post, where things seem mild at first.

I met Clingy back in 2012 at a common-interest meetup where we would see each other once a month. Then she stopped coming after a while, but she added me on Facebook. She tends to write long diary entries of what she did that day, adds tons of photos of the locations she went to, things like that. I mostly ignored her as it was harmless, and she never commented on anything I posted.  
Until a fateful day in 2017 when she posted that her boss had allowed her to have an assistant at a publishing company.

Now, I was fresh out of university and in need of a job that paid better than retail, so I commented. ""I live relatively nearby and would like to apply!""

She immediately PMed me and asked for my phone number so she could tell me all the correct interview answers so I would be the one chosen for the job as she needed ""a real friend in this hellhole."" Not sure we were close enough to be considered friends and not sure I was ready to work in a hellhole, but meh. I've worked with terrible people before, at least I'd be working with terrible people and earning more than minimum for once.

The interview went great, I got the job almost immediately, and on my first day Clingy bombarded me with every single job task all at once. I asked her to go slowly, there's time! She said she thought I needed to learn everything immediately as I might forget it. That made absolutely zero sense.

Every day she decided to hold my hand on every single task. Adding information to a document? She decided to almost write the information in for me herself. Filing papers away? She had to follow me to make sure everything was filed correctly. Phone call? While she would never pick up the phone herself, she would tell me exactly what to say to the person on the other line.

It didn't end there. If I wanted to go on a break, she decided she had to go with me on a break. If I wanted to go on lunch, she *had* to go on lunch with me. She herself decided that it was ""better"" to go on lunch at the 5 hour mark so the ""horrible"" work day could end sooner once we got back. If I decided to go on lunch before that when I was actually hungry, she'd pout and come along to lunch with me. Her reasoning was that I should never, ever eat lunch alone.

It took me about 2 months to finally decide enough was enough and at least wait until she was in the bathroom so I could run out to go on a break or lunch alone. She finally got the hint and let me be independent.

great dane mama and her human baby,83,apu3ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/apu3ki/great_dane_mama_and_her_human_baby/,6,1549983203.0,"I work at a dog kennel, so I have a lot of dog stories, but I think this one might be my very favourite.

I think I mentioned Daisy the great dane in a previous post. She was very obviously a great dane, had the classic great dane build, but her coat looked like it belonged on a dalmatian. She was the sweetest girl ever, and loved hugs and kisses. Like many big dogs, she seemed to be completely unaware of how big she was (and she was a bit larger than the average female great dane), but she was always very apologetic whenever she accidentally knocked someone over in her eagerness to show affection.

When Daisy's owners came to pick her up, my boss and I brought Daisy out to them, and they immediately set their baby boy (round a year old, in a baby carrier) down. My boss and I exchanged worried looks, but Daisy just walked over and sat down by the baby, sniffing at his head and letting him pat her neck. The baby was smiling and giggling and kicking his little feet, happy as could be, and Daisy was wagging her tail with the utmost enthusiasm.

I got all heart eyes, and said something like ""Aww, she's such a gentle giant!""

The parents laughed, and the mum said ""Yeah, Daisy thinks *she's* the mama.""

I don't remember much of the conversation after that, but Daisy stayed by the baby the entire time her owners were filling out paperwork, she trotted alongside the dad when he took the baby carrier out to the car, and she sat on the floor in front of where the baby carrier (or maybe it was a separate baby carseat? I don't know these things, my bad) was buckled in, so she could put her head in the baby's lap and let him pet her (which the baby was very excited about).

I know this isn't unusual behaviour for dogs, but it was just funny to see with a gigantic great dane.",2019-02-12 16:53:23
Dickwad Co-Worker Cursed Me Out Over Text,42,aplruc,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/aplruc/dickwad_coworker_cursed_me_out_over_text/,22,1549923258.0,"
UPDATE: Well...shit. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. 

I quit today. 

I spoke with my boss this morning about how I felt and what needed to be done for a respectful work environment and he agreed with me....only to let me down.

Half the day goes by with no Buggy. He finally shows up. Boss gets us together to mediate and make a clean slate. I respectfully start explaining to Buggy my issues with how he spoke to me and he IMMEDIATELY went off on me...yelling...cursing...the works. I told him to calm down and let me speak. He wouldn't have any of it. My boss just sat there looking forlorn. A customer came in, pausing the drama. After I came back from helping the customer I said ""I wanted this to go smoothly. I wanted to get past this, but HE won't allow it. I'm not going to subject myself to this environment if his actions are going to be tolerated."" 

And I just...walked out. 

The boss said earlier that he himself isn't a fan of Buggy but he knows the owner and he's immersed in the community so we just have to put up with him. I knew when he said that the chances of me walking were high...but I was hoping Buggy would be reasonable. Hooooo boy was that a naive wish. 

I'm shocked I kept my cool as well as I did. The man is a real mental midget. 



---------

So I work in a VERY small office for a very small, local company. How small? Three people in the office. Including me.

Now, I've had this job going on 4 months. I've worked in this field prior, but this new job has come with some added responsibility I had no experience in. I have to now work with clerical shit every day and it's not been an easy learning curve. My mind just doesn't adapt to it. Because of this, I've made a handful of mistakes. Nothing egregious. Nothing terrible. Just embarassing hiccups. My boss and I are on the same page.

As embarrassed as I get when I mess up (I suffer with TERRIBLE self esteem...especially when I feel I let people down) my boss has been kind and patient to a fault. And I ALWAYS cop to my mistakes, apologize and say I'll do better. I said once ""I'm surprised you're so patient."" He has said that if he felt I needed a stern talking to about my performance, he would give give it and that I continue to improve. Also, and not to sound like I'm making excuses, this office is NOT run like the tightest ship. It's pretty....eh, ""informal"" when it comes to learning. It's pretty much a ""learn as problems arise"" situation. And since my boss has to always run around out of office, I man the place by myself a lot - without having had standard training. 

In comes the third guy. I'll name him Buggy. 

Buggy is NOT my boss. He has no power over me. Buggy is an asshole. He's not very bright, either. He's rude. Unprofessional and crass. He IS good at his job. And his job is essentially hounding people for payment. He's our money guy. Because this is a small community, Buggy knows everyone and is incredibly nonchalant with his unprofessionalism because ""that's how he is.""

He can't work a computer and asks me to do a lot of his work for him (stuff he by definition he SHOULD be doing, but can't because he's computer illiterate) and I honestly don't mind. It's usually an easy thing and it helps me learn.

But whenever something goes even slightly wrong, Buggy loses his shit. My boss even said when I started ""People have had issues with Buggy before. But you kinda just have to ignore it.""

He's been insulting to customers and accounting to their faces. He brags about illicit and illegal shit he does. He's all around unpleasant. 

I knew right then I would end up having to confront Buggy at some point. I play nice with him. I entertain his stories and try to be buddy-buddy, but I knew if I made a mistake that he didn't like or he felt reflected poorly on him, he'd flip out. And so he did. Today.

For the past few weeks Buggy has wanted me to send an email to somebody every Friday. I keep forgetting and Buggy has reminded me on the following Monday.

I fully take responsibility for my lapse in memory with this. To be clear though, this isn't an urgent email so much as a courtesy thing for this one customer. They technically don't need this email at all. And it could easily wait till Monday every week. Moreover, Buggy can take the 60 secs to send it his damn self. But I send it. 

So today I get a text, riddled with errors, saying ""send the blah blah! I won't ask you again!""

I've swallowed rude and disrespectful co-workers before in past jobs. I was about to swallow this but thought ""No. You will not let somebody be rude to you at work."" 

I texted back: ""I will make a note to keep on my desk so I won't keep forgetting to send the email. But do not talk to me like that again.""

The following 30 minutes I get texts back saying ""fuck you. You work for me. If you don't like get out!"" and other insane shit. 

After the first ""fuck you"" and before the others,I told my boss...""Hey, I just had to tell Buggy to not speak to me in a certain way over text. He may call you.""

Sure enough the phone rings and it's Buggy. My boss laughs it off and tells me to answer it. I tell say ""He's calling to chew me out. If I answer I'll just sink to his level. You answer it please.""

So my boss does. I can hear Buggy ranting like a madman over the phone and my boss is trying to get him to chill out. He could barely get a word in. ""Buggy. Calm down. No-I won't do that. Bug-just relax."" 

I'm also fuming. I don't care what the situation is. You don't curse out and insult a co-worker. It's disgustingly unprofessional. If I messed up, tell me like an adult. I will apologize and fix it. 

I told my boss after he hung up: ""You know I cop to my mistakes. If I mess up, you let me know like a professional and we move on. He won't talk to me like that again.""

My boss is on my side, thank God (but I am annoyed Buggy's behavior is tolerated because of his standing with the community/importance to the business) and said we'll all hash it out tomorrow.

I will be the bigger man when I eventually see Buggy face to face. But God was it hard not stooping to his level and telling him to fuck off and to kiss my ass. 

If it wasn't for my boss, who I am loyal to, I would have just quit right there. Nobody should have to deal with that shit at the workplace. Ever.

▪letting one of her own dogs into the backseat of my car to sniff everything (this was right after I got a new car, and the dog just wanted to make sure everything was good and safe for me)

▪crying whilst chasing a raccoon away with a broom (I have nothing against raccoons and other such creatures, but this one was going after the dogs)

My first bad yelp review accused me of being terrified of her baby...,45,anlqqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/anlqqj/my_first_bad_yelp_review_accused_me_of_being/,6,1549419113.0,"To preface, I’ve worked customer service for at least 10 years. I am not super bubbly and outgoing but I’m not an idiot and I know how to talk to customers. Also, I know I’m very good at my job and make a lot of commission. 

This lady left a long, horrible review stating my name multiple times. It seemed like she wrote it immediately after she left since it was so detailed and had many spelling errors. 

So these two ladies with a baby in one of their arms came to my work one day. In the review she said I showed a “disgusted and uncomfortable” face as soon as I greeted them. Great start. They said I answered their questions at the bare minimum and acted scared of them. From there I led them into the back area which is a smaller hallway and showed them around. They stood awkwardly in the doorway/hallway so I said something like let’s go back into the main area. In her review she took this negatively and said “LIKE SERIOUSLY??? We’re 2 young women with a sleeping baby! How threatening did we seem???”

What?! How is me leading you back to the main area so we don’t have to stand in a small hallway is bad?

After that a third friend came with a baby about one year old. She immediately runs over to me and hugs my legs and looks like she wants me to pick her up. I do not want to entertain or pick up a stranger’s baby. Again, I’m not an idiot I acted friendly and smiled but tried not to interact with the baby. This lady perceived it as “immediately she tenses up and almost freaks out because this baby is close to her. I understand that some people are not comfortable getting near other people’s babies but she didn’t even wave or give a high-five or smile. My friends and I were disgustingly uncomfortable at this point”

At this point I explained the payment process and let them know everything can be done through email. Which I always think is nice and accommodating since it can be on their own time but of course this rubbed them the wrong way as well. “Basically she would rather deal with our business through a screen. She nervously and hesitantly hands us her business card” Then they mentioned how I locked the door behind them after they left. Am I not supposed to lock up a business I’m alone at? It is not an open storefront but an appointment only place. 

I just have never had someone so negatively describe me and make my actions sound so horrible. She wrote this whole review on her feelings for me and not the business. All of our other yelp reviews are 5 stars. 

My boss knows I’m great at my job and this lady is the worst so he doesn’t care. He jokingly called me a baby hater. 

I just don’t get people like this. What if I was sick or in pain and that’s why I was maybe having an off day? I know I wasn’t because I did make the next sale. I give the same spiel to everyone so I’m not sure why this lady took it the wrong way.

I worked the drive thru so it's not really my job to serve food in the dining room though I did sometimes when we were busy. I made the ice cream they ordered and served them and went back to my window. About fifteen minutes later my shift manager comes back and says that one of the kids threw up all over the dining hall and that some of the vomit had gotten on one of the chaperones shoes. Rather than going to the bathroom, this woman decided to rinse her flip flop off in the soda fountain. She tells me we need to break down the soda machine and sterilize the whole thing. Not long later, after cleaning the whole soda machine, my manager comes back to let me know that it's happened again and she needs someone to mop the dining area.

Tales Of Special Jacob: Enter the Hero,21,amfjpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/amfjpk/tales_of_special_jacob_enter_the_hero/,0,1549124519.0,"I've been thinking about posting some of this for a while and I think Jacob finally just broke my brain, so here I am, putting it out there for you lovely people to hear about the hell that I have to live though.  I normally post over at r/TalesFromRetail but these don't really fit over there so I'm here to give you lovely people some fun times.

**Enter The Hero**:  Jacob (Not his real name) is my coworker.  We work in an appliance parts store, selling appliance parts.  I have been doing working for this company for almost 20 years.  Jacob has been here for 10 years.  10 years... every time I complain about him not knowing how to do something remember that he has been here, doing the same job as me, FOR TEN GOD DAMNED YEARS.  Also, he's 20 years older than I am.  I'm in my mid 30s, he's in his mid 50s.  I will simply my thoughts on Jacob in one sentence.

I don't know how Jacob remembers to breath every day.

**Story The First**: U113 IS NOT 556.

As I said we sell appliance parts.  Parts have a long series of numbers attached to them so you know what they are, and what they belong to.  You take a model number, you pull up a breakdown of that model, and each part has a part number attached to it.  You enter that part number into our database and if we have it our database will tell you where in our warehouse that part can be found.  You go to that location and all the parts will be on a shelf in alpha-numeric order.  This means that parts beginning in 3 go before after parts beginning in 2, but before parts beginning in 4.  We use the Natural Sort Order system, meaning to order the parts based on the first digit forward, not on the number as a whole.  This means that part number 1112 goes before part 122.  Really simple, I promise.  Jacob, for some reason, can't figure this out and I still find parts out of order on a regular basis... but this story isn't even about that.

Jacob gets an order, goes and pulls the part, and put it out for the customer, something we do on a regular basis every day.  Order prints, has the customers name and the part they want.  EASY!  Fast forward about half an hour... I get an order for another customer and go looking for the part.  Right location... right shelf... NO PART!!  Says we're supposed to have one... what the hell?  I spend some time looking around and finally find the part... put to the side for another customer.  Confused, I look at our open orders in the system and there's no other order for that part except the one I'm trying to find.

>Me: ""Hey, Jacob.  What's up with this part you pulled?  I can't find a ticket for it.""

>Jacob: ""No, it is right here see.""

Jacob pulls the order and I look at it.

>Me: -sigh- ""Jacob, this isn't the same part.""

>Jacob: ""Isn't it?""

>Me: ""The part you were supposed to pull starts with U113.  This one starts 556.""

>Jacob: ""But they both end with 228...""

>Me: ""....go pull the correct part, this one is for my customer.""

Jacob actually huffs and pouts for a bit because I make him pull the correct part.  HE'S IN HIS 50S!!!!

**Second Story**: There's pictures!

So now time to show off how inept Jacob is when it comes to technology.  I'm the youngest person in the store so, of course, it is up to me to take care of any technological needs for everyone else.  Fine, whatever, I don't get paid enough for this shit.  Recently out IT department rolled out a new program, and in order to use this program we had to create a shortcut on our desktop for it.  Well there's the first hint that I'll have to do it for everyone... Jacob doesn't know what a desktop is.  Anyways, they send out an e-mail on how this needs to be done and holy shit the guys in IT must know the people they're dealing with.  Not only do they send step-by-step instruction on what needs to be done, but they included pictures!  PICTURES!!  Oh glory glory hallelujah I wouldn't have to hold everyone's hand!

Without having to be told I do the quick procedure on my computer, then run to the community computers and do it on those as well.  All told I added the shortcut to 4 computers in about 10 minutes, and half of that time was spent just booting up the computers because it was still early and no one else had needed them yet.

Then I go back to the counter...

>Jacob: ""Hey can you help me with this?""

>Me: -thinking he has an older computer so maybe the files weren't in the same place- ""Sure, what you need?""

>Jacob: ""Well I enter name in the search bar but nothing happens.""

>Me: -What?  There's nothing using a search bar...- ""What?""

>Jacob: ""Yeah, see, nothing.""

I go look and sure enough, he's trying to search for the file on the search bar, not something included in the instruction or the pictures.

>Me: ""Jacob... dude... did you read the instructions?""

>Jacob: ""Not all of them.""

>Me: ""Dude... just... read all of the instructions, then go back and follow them, using the pictures provided.  They show you exactly what to do and where to click.""

>Jacob: ""Okay.""

-five minutes later-

>Jacob: ""Ummm...""

>Me: ""Just move, I'll fucking do it.""

PICTURES!!  They included PICTURES of what to do and he still couldn't fucking figure it out.

Both of these stories took place within the last week... and I have so many more that I'm going to happily share to continue the tales of Special Jacob.",2019-02-02 18:21:59
RE: Pulse not working...,15,am9yz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/am9yz5/re_pulse_not_working/,3,1549075938.0,"The title is the header to 106 emails I have sitting in my work email that were made over the course of 15 minutes when I wasn't even at work and I want to share this simple story. Some of the company uses pulse security. Our department uses something different so this didn't even apply to us but we got the emails all the same. It stated with the system not working so one person sent out an email sent to team leads saying that it wasn't working and for people to email this to their teams and to reply if it's working or not. Little did they know this was about to be something I found hilarious when I got into work.

The emails went out to hundreds of team leads and then to thousands of employees who didn't know how things work. First there was 2 minutes of people using ""reply all"" to respond and say they either had the issue or not. This is about 10-20 of the emails. All the rest of the 80 emails are one of two exact same emails. Half the people sent out emails to everyone saying ""take me off this mailing list I don't have this issue."" but they had used reply all so they just made it worse. The other half other half of the emails are ""stop using reply all"" which is using reply all and there are 40 emails with that exact message so that made it worse too.

After the 15 minutes and 100+ emails they just all stopped. It was sudden and without warning or explanation. I got to work a few hours after this and don't even use pulse and usually only get maybe 5 emails per day. I read through them all and laughed at how many people did not know how to work their own email...We work at HP",2019-02-02 04:52:18

I live in Iowa, which is currently polar vortex central. I work at a dog kennel, and thankfully most of my work takes place inside.

Now, my boss is usually pretty cool, but every so often she demands something that just isn't gonna happen. In this case, she expected me to clean up the outside yards (the fenced-in areas where we let dogs out for bathroom breaks) when it was snowing so hard that I couldn't see a foot in front of me, and also TWENTY DEGREES BELOW ZERO (in farenheit; I think that's negative 29 in celsius, but I could be wrong).

So that super was NOT happening. I don't have the best circulation in my hands, and I'd rather not lose any fingers to frostbite. Also, with how hard it was snowing, you couldn't even see anything on the ground. Did she want me to dig through the snow for dog turds? Because she does NOT pay me enough for that.

Fortunately, because of the heavy snowfall, she couldn't tell that I didn't clean up the yards, so it all worked out for me. Still, why the hell would you ask that of someone?",2019-02-01 22:07:44

Also really long, I'll try to sum up. This happened to my mother, and as I dont know where to post but find it worth sharing Im gonna post here as it seems to fit.

A bit of context, I study and so save money still live at home. My mother works for a really big company, and for some time now, and has earned herself quite a reputation as a woman that doesnt hold back and takes no crap from anybody. So...
Yesterday my Mom came home from work, in a state between exhausted, giggly and confused, and tells me this story.

Their cantiene is run by extern women, and some dude from the assembley team complained rather rude about prizes and incorrect label and so on, being very aggressiv and sexist.
Now, my mum wasnt there (his luck), but had heard about this from the women and from other people and being the forward girl she is, wrote an called the chief of the assemly and told him to keep his boys in check and to wash their heads a bit. So far do good, and she thought the problem done.

Later that day, she got a call from the secretary of the executive board of the assembley and she complained to her that the whole deal wasnt that big, and why she had run to her own chief, and why on earth she felt it nesesarry that he told the head executive board, which lead to the offender being warned off. Obviously, she was rather confused, and they yelled at each other for about 10 minutes before she could tell her that she did nothing of all that. Which lead to a lot of confusion, and also to a lot of laughs in the big office my mom sits in.
All the while the chef of the cantiene called my moms boss and told him he didnt had to go the the head of the company over such an insignificant thing and so on, while he didint have aby clue what was going on.

Turns out, somehow someone did a lot of gossip and the whole story escalated into absurt stuff. The story now was that my mother had ratted about the offender to her boss, which then went to his boss and the board got involved and who knows what else. In the end, the whole damn company was talking about it, with five different versions of the story rotating.

Finally, the board called my mother and the whole thing was finally clear, but most likely it will still be a topic over the next days.

Tlr: My mom complained about a rude college and after five hours of gossip from various partys, nobidy knew what was going on and everything escalated.",2019-01-31 23:47:33

I work at a dog kennel. I mainly work in the back, but if my boss has to train dogs or run to the store, she'll have me in the front (only if she's expecting customers though; we don't do walk-ins).

So I'm in the front and this lady comes in with the tiniest little dog ever. The kind of dog that looks more like a toy than a real dog. I greeted her, made sure she was the customer I'd been expecting, had her fill out the necessary paperwork, all that stuff.

I asked her what her dog's name was, and she said it's Taco. I bent down to talk to the dog. ""Aww, you're such a cutie, Taco! And you're so little, like a mini taquito!""

Taco loved this. Taco's owner did not. ""Don't you EVER call him anything other than Taco! Do you want me to tell your boss how disrespectful you're being?!""

I apologised and promised I would only ever call him by his proper name. I told my boss later and we both had a good laugh over it.",2019-01-31 22:38:40
Almost Destroyed A Car Today,72,alh3nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/alh3nl/almost_destroyed_a_car_today/,2,1548880277.0,"I am, like, professional-grade stupid today. Industrial-strength stupid.

I do hitch installs, so basically I take a big piece of metal and bolt it to the underside of your car so you can tow things or get a bike rack.

I'm good at it. My work's been inspected by auto mechanics and they can't find fault. But not today. And, legitimately, today started with someone else's screw up: they assigned the wrong hitch to be installed on the car. 

You can't tell that though until you back the car up onto the ramp and take a look. So I back it up there, lower the exhaust (muffler) so it's hanging by a safety strap, and wheel the hitch over mounted on a jack so I can line it all up and have a look.

Yup, it's the wrong shape.

I do a little research and, after confirming my suspicions, head up to the office and call the customer. I let him know we have to order the part. He's just 10 minutes away so I open the bay door and hop back in the car, start driving it down the ramps...

***CCCCKKKKKKKKRRRRRR!!!!!***

Oh. Crap. Oh crap. Crap crap crap crap crap... what did I do?

As I'm getting out of the car I think: ""Right. The muffler. I forgot to mount the muffler back up. God I hope I didn't rip it...""

And then I see the hitch jack jammed under the car at a funny angle.

""SONOFAFFFFF..."" I begin swearing. A lot. I cannot believe I just did this...

I slap the button to close the bay doors and try to make a non-stupid decision about what to do next. 

Everything is jammed tight and I can't pull it out. The bumper is all squished up from underneath. The car needs to be backed up again, but I decide to just back it up a little and then take another look. 

So I back up, look, and it appears I stopped just in time. The hitch jack is now jammed between the car and the side of the riser. If I try going further back, things get damaged. But I can't move forward either.

I decide to disassemble the jack. Despite the fact that part of it is prying up the back bumper, somehow when I get it apart there's no damage. You can't even tell anything happened. 

So sure, in the process I send the hitch crashing and clanging onto the floor, and I've got a bit of work ahead of me trying to figure out how the heck to assemble a hitch jack, but... Honestly, I'm just glad the bumper isn't split in two. 

Next, the muffler. You're not going to believe this: it didn't even get scratched. If I'd gone any further down the ramps it would have been torn right off, but as it was I just crawled under there and popped the pegs back on the rubber mounts. Done.

Honestly I don't know what I did to deserve it, but I want to take this moment to thank whatever guardian angel is out there saving my dumb ass. ",2019-01-30 22:31:17
"The Sample Saga, Part 2 - The One With The Weird Citrus Fruits",32,akvjv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/akvjv5/the_sample_saga_part_2_the_one_with_the_weird/,4,1548730529.0,"**TL;DR: Nobody's heard of a pummelo. I had to get creative to shill it. *Really* creative.**

I'll get right into it and skip the 'I'm a free sample lady' explanation.

You know it's gonna be a weird day when you get your instructions for setup, and part of it dictates that you're going to be feeding people fucking raw lemons. Y'know, to establish dominance amongst their peers or something.

I knew going in that I was supposed to be giving out 'citrus fruits' and this stuff called WTR MLN WTR (stacked on top of each other vertically on the bottles, it doesn't look nearly as hip written out horizontally), of course, because I check the digital version of the instruction documents before walking in- I like to know what I'm getting into beforehand. Seemed simple enough, as I'd had to do interesting kinds of oranges several times in the past, so I figured it'd be one last dying gasp of all that. I wasn't *wrong*, exactly, but it was so much more than that.

In the back, I plopped my half-finished jug of Arnold Palmer, Nectar of the Gods, onto the cart... and dicked around on my phone for a bit because I got there a few minutes early.  *Then* I clocked in on time, starting to unpack my kit, prepping the signs on the sides, the trash can, the little serving cups... etc. One of the sign clips displayed the majestic organic fruit juice in all its glory; neat, I knew what to look for. The other confirmed my suspicions, displaying the exact same sign I'd become so familiar with over the course of this month. Sliding the panels into the plastic frames, I got on with reading the physical instruction, which listed the juice, 'Pummelos', 'Clementines', and 'Meyer Lemons'. No other info about them apart from the maximum number of each I was to acquire, with the latter two being listed in 'bags'. I assumed the mysterious 'Pummelos', which I knew from the *sign* to be some sort of grapefruits, to be the same.

*This assumption was incorrect.*

Skip a few minutes, and I'm having to get those bottles of juice *by the case* from Produce's cooler, since they only had *two* bottles left on the shelf, and I needed a maximum of *twenty-five*. I ended up with 14 in total and took many home, but damn. I don't think they ever did bother to put more out.

Skip a few *more-* I've located the lemons and mistakenly picked up the maximum 3 bags, for free as the store was donating them to the cause. Same situation with the ""Clem'ntines"" as they were labeled, but I only grabbed one of those- I had so many, and each one made 8 samples... surely that would be enough. ~~Spoiler: it was plenty.~~ couldn't for the life of me find these mysterious grapefruit-things, however.

After 3 trips to ask Produce again and a total of 30 minutes of 'shopping', I was finally directed to them. And by God, they were *enormous.*

If you've never seen one, and are too lazy to google, I'll explain. The reason I kept passing them is because they were *not* bagged. I thought they were small *melons,* in fact. These swollen, greenish orbs were the size of a small child's head, and I could just about carry the amount I needed: *two.* Two, *individually.* Seeing the size, I understood why I really wouldn't be needing all that many, but I still grabbed the maximum to be safe.

Then the plot thickened.

I set up right at the border of Meat and Produce, stashing the spare juice bottles in the refrigerated end cap of frozen shrimp, and decided to cut into one of those behemoths before anything else. I picked out the largest, most serrated knife I had to be sure, and got to work, quickly realizing that this thing had about the texture and general density of a small pumpkin. Eventually I managed to cleave it in twain by rotating the knife around it, and I immediately examined the contents, baffled by what I found.

The rind (I couldn't call something that dense and thick a peel or skin) was at least a full inch thick, with a consistency vaguely similar to those rubber-skinned foam balls used in elementary school gymnasiums across the nation, while the flesh itself in the dead center amassed to about as much as a standard, soft-ball sized grapefruit. It looked like a fleshy geode, and I had to take a moment to examine what I'd uncovered, sharing it with any passersby I could find that would listen.

I then discovered how to carefully pry the innards from the pulp, which in turn kept an odd fluffy skin on themselves until removed further, and got to work.

Not many wanted to sample the whole trayful of grapefruit bits I'd pulled from a single quarter of the organic monstrosity. Nobody wanted to shove a fucking lemon wedge in their mouth without being paid or held at gunpoint. And the majority shopper population of elderly folk weren't the kind to eat clementines, a type of fruit geared towards children. After a while, specifically once I'd eventually been able to peel the second quarter of the pummelo to put a few more chunks out, I got bored of just standing there as people either didn't walk by or merely rejected me on sight. Even dicking around on my phone, ""cleverly"" concealed in the cart's under-counter drawer, didn't help much.

Completely out of ideas to keep myself entertained and focused, I picked up the leftover quarter-peels of pummelo, and carefully balanced them on top of my hat, waiting for people to notice.

Surely a ridiculous sight, some Super-Mart employees came over to snack and have a laugh, and a few customers crept forward as well, even bringing along some children to enjoy the clementines. I'd apparently found a working gimmick, and inbetween people I'd dance with the other pummelo, as I decided entertainment was more important than dignity, apparently.

Skip a bit, and once I'd used the last of the first pummelo, I fashioned some citrus spaulders of the last two quarters. Thus, the Citrus Goblin was born.

I abandoned all sense of professionalism. I danced, I played, I made fun of the product. More and more people took samples from it, as well as the other products I had on display. I always gave the same speech when I saw someone stare at me, then the chartreuse globe to my right.

""-That's a pummelo. They're the size of a child's head, about 40% insulation foam, and make great vegan weapons and armor. ...It's basically a grapefruit but less bitter.""

The vast majority of people smiled or even laughed, which boosted my self esteem a bit, and kept me going until the end of the day, when I packed up and had to find a way to hold all of those fucking fruits I still had left.

*And not a single person ate a damn lemon.*",2019-01-29 04:55:29

"The Sample Saga, Part 1 - Like A Round Cracker, Life Is Pointless",25,aji5vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/aji5vh/the_sample_saga_part_1_like_a_round_cracker_life/,2,1548369249.0,"Hi! Already in my first month as one of the free sample ladies stationed in various locations in a familiar supermarket chain, I've had a few bad and oft ridiculous experiences. Thought I'd share a few of them here, starting with one that just happened today.

TL;DR to start us off: **I can't do my job, why am I still doing my job?**

So far, I more or less have this down pat. Check the pdf, find the box with a matching product labeled on it, decorate the car with its contents, buy the food, give out free stuff. Real simple, as long as the box is there, usually nothing goes wrong.

*Usually.*

Today was a new line of crackers from the first non-store brand that generally comes to mind. I purchased the maximum units allowed (two of each flavor) because last time I did an eerily similar product from a different brand, I nearly ran out completely with how they were getting gobbled up. I took a picture of the receipt as I went, started setting them out, and all was well.

For a while, anyway.

-The thing is, they were already low in stock on these crackers when I grabbed what I needed, and after I bought my share and put a couple of other flavors on the front shelf of my cart for show, it was slim pickin's over there. It took until after a slightly early lunch break for the crackers to hit the fan, but things started rolling downhill quickly. People were running to the conveniently situated chip and snack aisle just to my right, taking advantage of the near 50% off coupons I was giving away like they were on fire. The sour cream and onion were the first to go.

I took note of this immediately and informed people that alas, we'd run out of one of the very specifically *two* of six flavors I'd been allowed to share, but there were still a few bags left of the other one, and the coupons *did* work on literally any flavor over there... including the vast majority that they'd had no opportunity to try before they buy. A few declined my coupons, others went to check for themselves, I convinced one man to buy a flavor I'd bought and tried over my lunch. I was improvising and still selling *something.*

Then the 'original' vanished into the void as well.

'Sales' ground to a halt. My entirely unsupervised, third-party self had to come up with new ways to entice folks to take coupons, to still purchase *some* kind of crackers in this line with them. Not that they'd be able to buy any of the only two kinds they'd tried and liked, of course. Most were less than enthused.

A Super-Mart employee began stocking the chips and crackers, and as he brought a few unreachable bags from the top shelf, I thought my prayers had been answered.

Not so, unfortunately.

He'd only pulled out a few of the 'other' flavors, and when I asked if he'd be stocking the two that I needed, he delivered the final, crushing blow: it's a vendor item, so they have to wait for the next shipment of Upper-Crust before they can possibly put some more on shelves. Defeated, I made a few more last ditch attempts to sell the other flavors, particularly the one I'd personally enjoyed, but with no real success.

It dawned on me: They want me to sell crackers- specifically, these two specific flavors of them. If the store has run out of them, I can't sell any. The purpose of my position is thus entirely moot. *So what's the point of me hanging around?*

Reluctantly, I came to the decision that my standing around, accomplishing nothing, was probably doing about the same thing to the company as if I just clocked in this afternoon and hid in the restroom all day until it was time to leave. I'm not making any sales, and I'm essentially stealing time by not being able to make up my labor costs.

So I gave out the last of what I'd set on the cart, went to pack up, completed my little questionnaire for the day with an explanation of what happened (there was indeed an option for 'unable to complete event' as well), and clocked out.

I hope I don't get in trouble for this, but I felt like it was a justified move. I couldn't even sell 'similar products', because I was trying to, and nobody wanted to buy them.

Today's my shortest shift to date.",2019-01-25 00:34:09
Sage advice and a strange assumption,30,ahpsid,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ahpsid/sage_advice_and_a_strange_assumption/,4,1547929106.0,"This is technically a joys of being a cosmetic laser technician story, but it deserves its own post. Mobile post, shitty formatting. You know the drill. 

Anyway, I call in a client who usually works with another therapist, but said therapist is taking a day off. She shrugs, agrees to work with me, and in we go to start treatment. 

During idle conversation, she tells me she's just back from holiday, and how the locals there are much more friendly than the local kiwis. I disagreed, since the kiwis I had met this far had been pretty nice for the most part, but made noncommittal ""mmm"" noises and continued what I was doing. 

When I told her I had moved here from Ireland her first response was ""dear god, WHY?"" to which my usual response was ""why not?"" but since she doesn't seem to like New Zealand much, I didn't want her to start a list of all the things wrong with the country, so I told her I wanted to do some traveling and work abroad, to which she said nothing. Conversation flows onwards. 

We somehow get onto the topic of local news. For anyone who's been keeping up with New Zealand news, you probably know by now that an English backpacker was murdered here recently. This matters because the next thing she said to me was something to the effect of:

""don't get yourself murdered like that English girl""

Followed by a rant about how Tinder is Bad. I was so surprised I just kind of nervous-laughed it off and continued treatment. We finished up without any problems, and left the treatment room. When at reception, she asks for my name. I tell her, and she goes ""oh, I know a girl with the same name, do you know her?"" and after a few questions about where in Ireland she was from I had to tell her that there are over 4 million people in Ireland, more Irish people living abroad, and it is nigh on impossible for me to personally know every single person in Ireland with the same name as me. She still seemed convinced that I probably knew this girl. 

After she left my coworker turns to me, having heard the last exchange, and says ""this is why I don't like working with her""

TL;DR: client advised me not to get murdered and thinks I know every girl in Ireland with the same name as me. For the former, I appreciate the sentiment, but it might not be the most appropriate thing to say to your laser technician upon meeting her for the first time. And for the latter, Ireland has a slightly larger population than New Zealand... ",2019-01-19 22:18:26
This one might be funny if it wasn't so depressing,18,ahgroh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ahgroh/this_one_might_be_funny_if_it_wasnt_so_depressing/,2,1547856778.0,"Broadly, I'm a data specialist for banks. I've been doing this for years, and I really enjoy the work, but even work you love can be spoiled by a toxic environment.
I started a new job last year, and knew I was in trouble when I heard my boss utter the words ""everything is priority"".

Uh oh....

There's only a handful people on my team including the manager, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that any one of us could be a better manager.
It's impossible to get anything done when she's around, because she has no ability to prioritise anything, and constantly interferes with our work. It's horrible to say this, but she suffered a bereavement recently and for the two weeks that she was out of the office, productivity *lept up*.

In the last 3 months they've told me twice that they were going to let me go only to renew my contract unexpectedly a day or two before I was due to leave. It's pretty demoralizing, and I found it very hard to convince myself to work effectively, given that it was almost impossible to make any kind of progress on our workloads anyway.

The other people on my team are all permanent staff members, and they are all miserable *all the time*. One spends the day knocking down Rescue Remedy, one is clinically depressed and there is a rate of absenteeism in the team the likes of which I've never seen in my working life.

A week or two ago my boss pulled me aside to ask why I was not working as effectively as I used to, and I thought ""Hell, either I'm going to leave or they're going to fire me anyway, but my colleagues are stuck here and they're all miserable- maybe I can help them"". 


So I tell her, frankly and unambiguously, that the entire team is demoralized and several are suffering from work stress (which is true -I didn't make it up), and that productivity in the team would be greatly increased by efforts to improve morale, workload, and just generally recognising their hard work from time to time.

She looked at me bewildered for a moment. Then she told me my colleagues are depressed because I am not working hard enough.

I'm not quick to fault people for social ineptitude, as several loved ones think I'm an undiagnosed autistic, but seriously -how can that be the response to being told this sort of information about the people you work with?",2019-01-19 02:12:58
Performance Appraisal,11,ahdlly,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ahdlly/performance_appraisal/,3,1547837176.0,"I just received my performance appraisal for 2018.  It was mediocre at best, and therefore so was my raise.  This unfortunately is the third year in a row that this is the case.

So in trying to reflect what has happened, I looked back at the last 10 years of appraisals.  First what I noticed was the enormous difference between 9 to 4 years ago and the last 3.  Back then I was getting individual spot awards, getting outstanding appraisals, and above average raises.  Back then in my project I was surrounded by PhDs and doing interesting challenging work.

That project's funding collapsed by no fault of my own, so I took a transfer to a new group.  I was zero days without an assignment, which was an accomplishment.  There is a lot of pressure to get an assignment quickly or risk being laid off.

This new assignment is web application maintenance with stable consistent funding.  The technology stack is dated, and mostly what we are doing is trying to keep up with the current revisions of the tools and frameworks we use.  My technical lead is content with architecture that went out with the 2000's.

I was the technical lead for my previous project, so this is very frustrating for me.  I try to push for better architecture, documentation, and process control with some very limited success.  Our common boss does the performance appraisal, and since she has no visibility into my work, I can tell from our conversation that it is based heavily on the technical lead's opinion of my attempts to step up our game.

So before, being surrounded by excellence, the ceiling was high and I was able to reach it.  But now, with the ceiling so low, I actually get down graded for constantly trying to push it upward.  Even if I am cautious and tread lightly, the reward is punishment.

It is very frustrating.  I am capable of so much more.  It isn't me that has changed, but the opportunities that my assignment have afforded me.",2019-01-18 20:46:16
The joys of being a cosmetic laser technician pt2,51,agibxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/agibxf/the_joys_of_being_a_cosmetic_laser_technician_pt2/,5,1547619680.0,"Another collection of stories. TL;DR and/or moral at the end of each story. Mobile post, apologies for format. 

*Story 1*

Client calls, says she's running late for a half-hour hair removal treatment. I tell her this is fine, ask her how long she's going to be. Says she'll be 10min late. This is fine, I'm pretty efficient in my hair removal treatments, so we have some wiggle room. She hangs up and I continue with what I was doing. 

Ten minutes after her treatment start time rolls by, and I'm still waiting for her. At the 15minute mark I call her again, and she claims she's nearly there. Still no sign of her at 20 minutes into her treatment time. I haven't a snowballs chance in hell of getting her treatment done in time before my next client shows up. She finally breezes in at 25 minutes late, literally walking in behind the client after her, and I have to break the news that I don't have time to do her treatment. She claims that because she is there, and it is not her fault she was late, I should do it anyway. I tell her I have a client, and I don't have time. She promptly says ""can't she wait until I'm finished?"" and I politely tell her that no, she can't. Manager spots an explosion about to happen and promptly rescues me, telling me to take my client in. So I call the other client, who has been sitting quietly in the waiting area with a magazine. I spotted the late client booked in for a slot later that day, and she said no more about it when I finally brought her in for treatment. 

*Moral:* if you turn up late, there's no guarantee that we can accommodate you, even if it's not your fault. And no, we will not prioritise you over other clients. 

*story 2*

Client comes in for laser hair removal, and during her treatment tells me that she can't see any difference in her skin since she began microneedling with us. I proceed to bring out the iPad and go through some of her progress photos with her. There is a slight difference, but clearly not as much as she was hoping for. I hand her over to head cosmetologist, who talks to her about it, and later head cosmetologist tells me that this client was peeved that no one had complimented her on her skin since starting the treatment, and she should have had way more noticeable results by now. Head cosmetologist has to tell her the same thing I did, that for her level of scarring and pigmentation, she's in it for the long haul, and three treatments is barely the tip of the iceberg. She ends up booking for further treatment, but strongly hints that she better start seeing results soon. 

*moral:* we are therapists, not gods. We can't work miracles, and your deep acne scars are not going to magically disappear in three treatments. It's a commitment.


*story 3*

Girl books in for consultation and treatment. Brings her mother with her. I don't mind this, sometimes it happens. First thing mother does is inform me that she is a holistic therapist, and gives me her card. That's nice, I'm a holistic therapist too, I just happen to be working in cosmetic laser right now, but OK. I brush this off and start the consult. I feel like this introduction should have given me a hint as to what this consult was going to be like... 

Mother did literally all the talking, despite the fact that the actual client was an adult (21) and could speak for herself. Mother told me exactly what she wanted me to do (face), some history on the client, and when she's showing me which areas really need work, she straight up GRABS her daughters face and roughly swings the girls head left and right to show me the areas she wanted covered. She was pretty forceful about it. I almost told her to stop mauling the poor girl. She can't get a word in edge ways around her mother, who is asking all the questions, despite the fact that I spend the entire conversation talking directly to the client. 

At the end of the consult, mother points her finger at me and demands that I do all of her little darlings treatments. No one else is allowed to work on her. I'm fine with this, it means I can keep an eye on treatment progression, but it does mean that if she books in on a day I'm not here, there will probably be hell to pay. I still make a point of telling her that regardless of who does her treatment, she'll receive the same standard of care. Treatment goes without a hitch, and client finally manages to get a few words in when she gets onto the bed for treatment. Nice girl. Very polite. No real ending to this story, girl is still coming for treatment. Sometimes mother is with her, sometimes she isn't. Mother has a habit of asking the exact same questions every time she comes in. 

*TL;DR:* overbearing mother is overbearing. Does all the talking for her daughter, who is the actual client. Manhandles her adult daughter during consultation. Poor girl can't get a word in edge ways until she's actually having the treatment done. 


*story 4*

I'm training in tattoo removal. Client comes in with a name tattooed on her inner wrist. Consult goes well, client is happy to go ahead with treatment. Decides she doesn't want numbing cream prior to treatment as ""the wrist isn't that painful"" therapist and I side-eye each other, ask if she's sure, and continue. I'm just observing at this point, other therapist is doing the treatment. 

Client nearly hits the ceiling on the first shot of laser. Cue a stream of colourful expletives. 

Client: I didn't think it'd hurt that much! 

Therapist: unfortunately yes, tattoo removal does hurt quite a bit. 

Client: it didn't even hurt when I was getting the tattoo done though! 

Therapist: this is different, we're generating a lot of heat to break down the pigment into smaller molecules so it can be absorbed into your system. Would you like some numbing cream now? 

Client: Nah, I've started now so I might as well finish. I'll get it next time. 

So treatment continues, heavily punctuated with enough swearing to make a sailor blush, along with curses directed at the name she has tattooed on her wrist. None of it is directed at the technician, she's surprisingly good natured with us given how much pain she's in, but she admitted that she's learned her lesson. At the end of the treatment, she cackles somewhat evilly about how the person in question has her name tattooed much bigger on his upper arm. On the plus side, the tattoo picked up nicely, and it looks like treatment is going to be successful. 

*Moral:* think very carefully about the names you get tattooed onto your body, because you may regret it later. And if your tattoo removal technician offers you numbing cream for your first sitting, maybe you should take it. Because that sh*t hurts. 


*story 5*

Another tattoo removal story. This time a 13 year old girl frogmarched in by a rather peeved mother. Turns out this girl has given herself a stick-and-poke tattoo of a dollar sign. I wasn't allowed to observe for this one, mother wanted as few people seeing it as possible. Treatment goes well, mother pays for it and they leave. 

Head therapist tells me later that the girl took the treatment like a champ, but there were a few tears involved, and that she gave herself a dollar sign because she thought it'd make her rich. Oh, the innocence of kids... 

*moral:* get permission before you give yourself a tattoo when underage. Also while it's a very cute idea, tattoos aren't that kind of magical... 


*story 6* 

Manager of the clinic is a man, and he volunteered to model for my first laser skin rejuvenation treatment. Senior therapist walks me through the settings, tells me that he can be sensitive, and I start treatment. 

Turns out he's very sensitive, and he's finding it quite painful. Head cosmetologist (his wife) comes into the room during the treatment, and the first thing he does is reach for her hand, which she laughs at and lets him hold both of her hands for the rest of his treatment, while she observes. It was both sweet and mildly amusing to watch. 

*moral:* sometimes all you need is a hand to hold. Or two.

The Art of Distraction,47,agbm56,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/agbm56/the_art_of_distraction/,1,1547577274.0,"Last week the big boss (let's call him Mackieboy) came through for his annual inspection and everyone was on edge. For about a week before there was a lot of stress and a lot of ""that's exactly the kind of thing he yells about!"" lectures.

The thing you need to know about Mackieboy is that, ever since I started working here, everyone has told me about him. *Everyone.* Fellow clerks, people from other stores, every manager I've ever met, company techs who were just in for one day, delivery drivers, you name it. If you work at this company you know Mackieboy and you have a story about him.

And the story is always the same: Mackieboy sees something, randomly decides it is the single cause of the destruction of the company, and screams his fool head off that it be fixed in some random, often questionable way, all the while insulting you for your incompetence.

Everyone hates him. And not in a ""he's tough but that's what it takes to get the job done"" kind of way, but more if a ""I hope he covers himself in gas and lights a cigarette"" kind of way.

So he's coming in today and I've got a problem: this morning's hitch install is a total disaster. I've broken 5 bolts in that stupid frame and it's taking hours to drill them out, break the weldnuts, fish in the replacement carriage bolts, etc... 

Okay super boring details but here's the crisis: I wanted to be out of there hours before Mackieboy showed up. He's coming in at a point where the place is full of scattered tools, metal shavings, oil, grease, wire, tape, etc... And from the stories, he won't care that I'm in the middle of a job.

And... That's not the worst of it. In my rush I've actually committed a serious safety infraction.

But we'll come back to that.

So he breezes in with a small entourage and starts asking question after question after question. My manager barely finishes answering before another comes. 

""Why are those on that shelf?""

""That's where the shelving diagram from corporate said...""

""Is this the only kind we carry?""

""No, we also have these.""

""How many are you selling?""

Etc...

They're in the front shop but I can hear the interrogation in the back the whole time. Eventually they move back to where I'm working and, to my horror, decide to hang out there and continue the barrage of questions. 

""And what qualifies as meaningful assurance?""

""Government ID or...""

""Not including driver's license?""

""Well it depends...""

Anyway they go on and I'm just waiting for him to look at me and notice what I've done. Finally he turns his attention in my direction. 

""Ugh these lights! They're giving me a headache! Do you have a problem with these?""

""No, they're fine,"" I shrug from under the car.

""No this is unbearable. We're pulling them off the walls and mounting them on the ceiling.""

Great, just what I need. Shadows everywhere.  Gonna make working under these cars a real treat.

But in that moment everything I've observed falls into place and I start to draw some conclusions. 

Mackieboy's questions aren't about checking to see if things are being done right. He clearly has no idea how things should be done and isn't aware of the company's policies. He's just fishing for reasons to justify his paycheck. 

Basically he's making decisions to show he's a decision maker. He's not trying to actually improve things because even he doesn't believe he knows how to do that. He just wants to make decisions. 

Also he's apparently incredibly insecure. 

Okay. This could save my butt.

I crawl out from under the car and walk up to him. I square off, look him in the eyes, and stare like I'm preparing to do a basic eyeball removal with the wire cutters in my hand. I do not look away. He has my full attention, and has no choice but to give me his. 

Nothing makes insecure domineering people squirm more than that. But controlling his gaze is the real goal here.

He complains about the mess, but backs off right away when I point out he's interrupted a job in progress. Desperate to break eye contact he does the ""elevator eyes"", looking me up and down for reasons to complain, and my closing the distance pays off. He complains about my filthy jeans and retreats from my unsettling gaze. He finally moves on. 

So he never notices that I forgot to wear my steel toe shoes. 

Which, had I injured myself, would actually be a huge workplace safety claim. He could have fired me on the spot.

"Working as a Divemaster, my worst ""client""",66,abueom,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/abueom/working_as_a_divemaster_my_worst_client/,13,1546443281.0,"This is gonna be a long one, so Tl;dr right away: used to work as a divemaster (dive tour guide). Client was very likeable, but in the water: zero attention span, basically a threat to himself and people looking out for him or just diving with him. 


So this happened almost two years ago. I had decided to take a break from my regular office job and make a job of one of my passions: scuba diving. I had done my divemaster training (which qualifies me to guide certified divers and do ""scuba reviews"" with them if they haven't been diving for a while) before I left, and went to a small island in Thailand which is mainly known for scuba diving and as a party location for backpackers. Found a job there, made a lot of great friends in the dive center, had a genuinely good time. The clients, too, were exclusively likeable and in most cases easy to work with. 

I had just started working a few days ago (just diving for fun and getting to know the sites before that) - in comes ""Matt"" (not actual name). He tells the guys in the store that he's a travel journalist and would like to do some diving and write about it. Naturally, that instantly makes him the managers friend and he's not paying as long as he mentions the dive center's name in his publications. He's certified, so no instructor required, but needs a scuba review. I haven't done one for this since center before, so our head DM ""Julie"" takes him, I tag along and watch just for a few specifics, easy. 

The afternoon boat that day was chill, no other fun divers, two or three courses, so we picked a nice and shallow site, mostly sand but some coral on the sides. On our way to the site, we do our briefing and setup as usual, go through hand signs, no big deal. Some time left, so we have some small talk with Matt. He's a genuinely nice guy, and as you'd expect from a travel journalist, he's got some pretty cool stories to tell. 

So we get to the site, suit up and get in the water. Go down, nice spot around 6m (~20ft) deep, kneel in the sand and just go through the skills as briefed. He's not perfect, but manages them well enough in the end. Since he's a big guy (about 1.90/6'3 and 130+kg/285+lbs) he's already used quite a bit of his air, but not too bad. He had trouble signaling his remaining air on request though, so Julie just checked it directly. 
Once we're done with that, we start into the standard fun dive part. Julie is leading, I'm officially ""buddying"" with Matt so I'm staying next to him, maybe a little behind to have an extra eye on him because, well, I work here. We go southwest, aiming for one of the coral banks as discussed in the briefing. 

When on a dive, you usually go at a slow pace - it helps with your air consumption. Matt doesn't do that, a few times he almost passes Julie. She always notices and tells him to stay behind, also goes a little faster. We want him to have a good time, after all.

At some point, Julie takes a slight right turn - I think we had just passed a feature from which she knew the most direct way. And Matt... Just turns left. I was genuinely surprised, as he had seemed very compliant in the briefing. Take a second to think - Matt is again going fast, so I decide to go after Julie, tap her (or grab her fin, don't quite remember) and show her he's going the other direction. Still in sight, so no big issue, but annoying (had I gone after him, I think she would have been out of sight by the time I had him turn around. Good choice). Now she obviously can't talk, but I could clearly see the ""what the f*ck?"" in her. 

What can you do... So we go after him, catch up, tell him to follow her again. He complies, for maybe a minute, then goes off in a seemingly random direction again. I am faster to grab Julie this time, and she too is more resigned than annoyed. If you don't want the corals, sure, let's just swim over sand. So we more or less follow him, keeping up and making sure he's safe. We go mostly in circles...well, at least we didn't have to far too return to the boat in the end. As he's been going fast, the dive ends after about 20-25 minutes (at that depth, we usually do 60 min dives easily) 

Okay, dive over, we have another one before the boat returns (we run 2x2 dives a day). I'll be leading that one, Julie will just be tagging along. In the briefing we discuss how he went off plan in the previous dive, and explain to him that he needs to be more attentive to whoever is leading. It's better for his experience since we know where the cool stuff is, but it's also important for his safety. He apologizes and says that he just was so fascinated by something and let his attention wander. Fair enough, I guess that can happen. Just try and focus a bit more on the next dive.

Next site is a bit more exposed, deeper and rockier, one that I enjoy a lot more than the first. Matt goes wandering off once or twice, but he seems a bit better than on the first one. I think he tried really hard on that one, and I don't have a lot to complain about after the dive. Still, he's not the kind of diver you want to have more than one of to lead in a group. 

That's also Julie's assessment, so we decide in the evening that all the boats he's coming along on, we'll have one DM taking him and one taking any other fun divers. Boats are usually planned a day in advance, so we always know when we need someone for Matt. Since I'm the new guy, the task of taking him falls to me (which sucks a bit as we get paid by customer tanks, i.e. when I'm taking only him, and the other DM has four clients, they make four times the money I do, but I'm still okay with that). He takes I think two more afternoon boats over the next few days, things stay pretty much the same. He won't signal his remaining air  even after me explaining it several more times in the briefings, he is hard to control in the water, and dives are short and hard to enjoy, but not horrible. He's still a total blast out of the water and I kinda grow find of him in spite of everything. 

Then about a week later, I'm just picking gear for the morning boat, taking two other clients. Matt shows up, says he wants to come along since we're going to this dive site which is supposed to be amazing (it is - my favorite around the island), he talked to the manager at a bar last night and the manager said that's fine, just show up at 7 (in his defense, we had not told him Matt was a problem case). He's not signed up so I'm the only DM on that boat. I'm not very comfortable with this, but I suppose I can handle this. I've taken the other two clients out before - the girl (""Rose"") several times, the guy (""Mike"") just once, but they were both reliable, so this should work. 

I introduce them, we get on the boat, briefing, no big deal. Luckily the site is a bit further out, so we have time. I do a standard briefing for the whole group, then I take Matt aside and explain to him how things have to be a bit different this time since I cannot give him the 100% attention I have been before. He says that's okay, asks a few more things, sounds good. I take the other two aside and explain to them how he's a bit hard to dive with and we may have to work around him a bit. They understand and are genuinely supportive, just great people.

So we go in the water. This site is far out and deep (still not catastrophically so, but one of the deepest we go to), and this day it's a bit choppy. I want to swim a bit closer to the site on the surface, just so we get a little bit more out of it, tell them so and we start moving. Just a few seconds later, Rose says ""uhm, u/_Random_Walker_, he's going down"" (he was just behind a wave at that moment from my position, so I couldn't see)...off to a good start. ""Jesus...okay, let's all go down"". So we do, everybody is okay, fine let's just swim there under water. 

...and Matt just...i don't even know. He's far ahead within seconds and we can only follow, we have dropped to 24m (~80ft) deep within two minutes when I finally catch up to him. I grab his fin and tell him to go shallower and the other direction. Rose catches up with us and hands me a weight. I just look at her questioningly - turns out Matt had lost it and she picked it up. He still managed to descend just by kicking as hard as he does. I thank her and put it back in his pocket, and he's off again. To be fair, on this dive he manages to signal his remaining air on request. I do my very best to control him, but he is just a total nightmare. At some point I just motion an exasperated ""what am I supposed to do"" for myself... And can hear Rose laugh into her regulator behind me. Well, I'm glad you're having fun at least. Like, genuinely, this dive is a total trainwreck and you're paying for it, at least you're entertained. I'm still not happy. 

Within 15 minutes Matt is down to 70bar (~1000psi) of air which is our ascent pressure (so we can do our safety stop at 5m and surface with 50bar). When I signal this I get a ""wth?"" look from Rose who is still at 120+ bar (as are Mike and I), but there's nothing I can do - dive's over.

Back on the boat, I take Rose and Mike aside and apologize, and promise them I'll figure something out for the next dive. I then get Matt and tell him I can't take him on the next dive. I'm polite, but honest about the reasons. He's just impossible to take in a group, and we were lucky conditions were good on this site. We are now going to the wreck, which is deeper than we went on the last one (we didn't go to the bottom on that site so we could get at least some more time out of it - the deeper, the more air you use) and it is known for bad visibility. He's not happy, of course, but says that's okay (""it's stupid down there anyway""). Well, what can you do. 

I take Rose and Mike on the dive, and we have a good one. Still, visibility was about 3m (10ft) and had I taken Matt with us, I think he might well have gotten lost, ran out of air  (since he wouldn't check by himself, only when asked) and drowned. Or ascended too fast and suffered severe decompression sickness, possibly died from that. 

Matt didn't speak to me on the way back, other than again tell me it's okay when I sought him out again and told him that I'm still happy to take him diving, just not in a group. He got off the boat, left without another word and I never heard from him again. 

To the best of my knowledge, he has not published anything about diving with our center. TBH, I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't actually a travel journalist and just used this story to get to dive for free. Or if he wasn't certified. I became an instructor later on and I definitely wouldn't certify him with the behavior he showed in the water. He's a threat to himself and anyone he dives with. At best, I could imagine some dive center got the same ""I'll write about you"" deal and they had an instructor working around him the same way we did, so they could certify him...

Sexism's Flipside - Mz Knowitall,46,abalx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/abalx2/sexisms_flipside_mz_knowitall/,6,1546286153.0,"About a week ago I posted [Sexism Exists, Apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/a8o5hw/sexism_exists_apparently/?utm_source=reddit-android), which was me being a bit vulnerable about my ignorance. There was some positive conversation in the comments despite some painful smugness and condescending virtue-signalling. Most people though were pretty cool.

But one thing became clear: people have no clue at all what it's like to be a man working customer service.

The way a man's instincts tell us to deal with idiots is often illegal, and even expressing our feelings about it can be a legal issue.

For example: Mz Knowitall.

Mz Knowitall seemed pretty pleasant when she came to my counter. We had a nice little chat as I worked through the booking screens to get her a rental truck. 

She gave way too many details about her life, how and why they were moving, and often tried to tell me how to do things she didn't know anything about, but I get that all the time and don't sweat it. It's how people deal with their anxiety. I indulged her and we were getting along splendidly.

Until it was time to pay.

""Here's the price.""

""Why is it so high?""

""Because reasons,"" I'll spare you the boring details, ""But of course keep in mind someone cut you a deal here when they set it up. Normally it would have been more.""

""Well that's not what I was told.""

The ""not what I was told"" line is classic BS. Either you weren't listening or you're lying. Regardless, this is the price, this is the way it is.

So here's the strategy: if you're a guy, we fight. I give you crap for the ""not what I was told"" line itself in a very ""what kind of sh!t are you trying to pull"" kind of way. We both know you're full of it, and it's my job to get you to accept that we both know you're full of it as the premise for the rest of the conversation.

Because if I don't do this, you'll keep arguing, and you'll get angrier and angrier as a way of proving your point. 

To do this correctly I have to demonstrate right here, right now, that I'm super comfortable with confrontation right up to and including the possibility of getting my face punched. I have to totally defeat your desire to test me by giving you the impression that you already see where this is going. 

So I have to say things like: ""Well, I don't know what you were told, but this is the way it is. What do you want to do about it?"" And then I have to stare you the f!ck down until you look away, shaking your head, saying ""okay"" in mock confusion. 

It's a pretty standard power dynamic ritual when men disagree about something and both want to feel ""empowered"". It's how we deal with the potential of one of us taking advantage of the other, and when you smile and joke together afterwards you feel that warm bond with one another from having survived a tense spot. 

But that song and dance won't work with a  ""not what I was told"" if it's a woman. Well, *it will*, but it will end on a much more grim note. 

Sorry if that's ""sexist"" of me but let's review the situation: she's a relatively small woman, I'm a relatively tall man, she's a bit older than me, and my willingness to confront will be interpreted as bullying or intimidation. It just will. There's zero chance of us bonding here with that strategy. 

Alternatively, I can't use a strategy of arguing the facts of the situation either. Man or woman, that never works with a ""not what I was told"" person. So if I'm stupid enough to try and prove that this was, in fact, what she was told, she'll pull the old ""well that's not how they ***made me feel***"" argument, which falls into that whole ""you have a right to your feelings regardless of the facts and your feelings matter even more than the facts do"" quagmire. Proving I'm factually correct will screw me here.

So I go with the third option. 

She says: ""Well that's not what I was told.""

I shrug and make the allusion to vague powers beyond our control or comprehension: ""Well, that's the discounted rate the computer says they set up for you,"" indicating that her arguments should be directed at the magic computer box because, well, I just don't know... I guess. Nice and vague while still referring to it as an unchangeable fact.

I then followed quickly by the subject change: ""So you can use a credit card, debit, or cash.""

""Well I don't have any cash on me.""

""No problem, we can use credit cards or debit, your choice!""

Positive language, upbeat ""I'm on your side"" attitude, a careful re-direct to focus on possible solutions instead of re-listing her problems. So far I am a customer service ninja here. But of course...

""Well we can try my credit card but there's no available credit,"" she says as she pulls out her card. It declines. Shocker.

""Okay that leaves us with debit I suppose.""

""Well I just don't have that kind of money!""

Now, I don't know what exactly she expected me to do here. Give her an even bigger discount? Make it free? But at this point I'm done and just want her gone, so I list her options again:

""Hmm I'm sorry but that's just what it costs. So if you have another card we can try that, or you said this was for your son so if he has a credit card...""

She opts to bring her son in, who has cash. I remind her of the amount so he can make sure he brings enough, let her know I'll save the paperwork we've done so far to save her time, and give her a smile and wave on her way out.

Woot, stuck the landing. That was a tough one but I feel damn good about my customer service acrobatics. Even the Russian judge gives me an 8/10. This is why people go out of their way to write nice notes about me on the company website. If you can't tell, I take some pride in this stuff. 

Mz Knowitall comes back later, ends up going to my manager at the next computer over. I grab the paperwork and hand it to Jenny so she can skip ahead a little.

And then Mz Knowitall drops this: ""I wanted to deal with you because I was very unhappy with the customer service I received from *that one* over there,"" waving imperiously in my general direction. 

And I was livid. I. Stuck. The. Landing. You. Jerk.

And had it been a man I'd have been in his face immediately. ""I'M SORRY? WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE PROBLEM SIR? DO WE NEED TO GO OVER THINGS AGAIN? OH IS THIS YOUR SON? YA COME HERE BUDDY LET'S TALK!""

But... She was sitting there at the manager's desk, this lady half my height with a wallet full of maxed credit cards, and I couldn't do it. Sticking my nose into what was happening next to me would just create a lot of tension, and even if I told her how disrespectful and deceitful she was being in the most polite way I could, it would still seem threatening. 

So I had to stand there, seething, and take it.

Fffffff... damn. It burns man, it really burns.

But my manager had my back. When Jenny heard that Mz Knowitall was unhappy with my customer service she told me her first thought was: ""Well then honey you're really gonna hate what I'm gonna do to ya!"" She knows me, knows how much even the biggest troublemakers that come in here love me, and knows that whatever this lady's problem was it wasn't something I did.

So every time Mz Knowitall made a suggestion on how to do something, Jenny instantly agreed and did it that way.

Which broke things, made things take longer, and destroyed the deal that had originally been in the system. By the time they were done the thing cost an extra $100 and there was no going back. 

The customer is always wrong.

Not saying that I didn't hit the bottle when I got home but it did help that Jenny had my back there and got me my revenge. Still... I so wanted to leap that counter...

Side note: did this on my phone so apologies for typos, etc.",2018-12-31 21:55:53
"Sexism exists, apparently",154,a8o5hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/a8o5hw/sexism_exists_apparently/,27,1545510510.0,"Confession time: for years I honestly didn't get it when women would complain about sexism. Didn't experience it myself so with the exception of a bunch of tweets and Tumblr posts I had no idea what all the fuss was about. 

It wasn't until I fought shoulder to shoulder with my manager against the hordes of rabid customers that I got to see it first hand.

I'm going to give you two specific examples so that you don't mistake this for some kind of SJW virtue-signalling liberal nonsense. I hate that crap, but I've seen this happening.

One guy stands out in my mind because he was wearing a green shirt. That's all that made him different from the other jackasses we get in daily. 

We're getting slammed as usual, big lineups, noisy room, total chaos. Manager is selling some boxes to Green Shirt:

Ma: ""Okay, that's $38.85 for the bundle.""

GS: ""You're really pretty.""

Ma: ""Thanks! So was there anything else?""

GS: ""Uh... No not unless I can get your phone number!""

She laughs and clicks through the purchase. He pays, receipt prints. 

He reaches over and makes a real point about stroking her hand as he takes the receipt. She reflexively pulls her hand back but tries not to make a big deal about it. Unfortunately the quick movement is noticed and rustles his jimmies. 

GS: ""Well you didn't have to be such a stuck up cxnt about it!"" Off he storms out the door.

This crap happens every damn day to at least one of the female staffers in the place.

I've seen guys sniff her hair (ew dude!), propose marriage the first time they meet her (have some dignity man!), and one guy asked her out while she was setting up his trailer. When she didn't call him he left a bad review.

And no she isn't all done up in any special way. She looks like a regular normal person. She wears the store uniform. So do I but I can't remember the last time someone yelled at me for being a stuck up cxnt.

If you're still having trouble understanding the problem here, imagine living in a world where everywhere you went, even at work, someone bigger than you asked for spare change. Over and over, every single day, and they get real pissed and call you a bitch and a whore whenever you say no.

And that's only half the problem. 

The other half is that nobody believes anything she says. She knows way more about these trucks and trailers than I do (although I do kick ass at hitch installs) but men defer to me constantly for every type of question. 

There was this funny old Italian guy with a thick accent. Positive and friendly interaction, he asks her questions and she confidently rattles off the correct info, and they're all good.

Except he doesn't leave. He says:

IT: ""Before I go I want to speak with the man here.""

He waits around for me to wrap it up with my customer.

Me: ""Hi! How can I help you?""

IT: ""Do you know how big the back door of the truck is?""

I heard my manager answer this question already. So I play dumb.

Me: ""Hmm I'm not sure!"" I lean over and make a big show of asking my manager. ""What's the clearance on that back door?""

Ma: ""5 foot 7 inches.""

Me: ""Okay. 5 foot 7 inches sir.""

IT: ""Okay. Okay. And... Will a full-sized 6 foot long freezer fit in there?""

I turn to my manager.

Me: ""Hey do you think a 6 foot freezer will fit in there?""

Ma: ""Yes.""

Me: ""Okay. Yes.""

He asks me three more questions that she already answered. I make a production of asking her every single time. He never gets the hint.

How often does this happen? Scientists say:

> ""It's every day bro."" - Albert Einstein 

Plus, if they don't spot me, guys will ask her if there's a man around all the time.

I honestly had no idea. Reality works completely differently for her than it does for me. I mean... I'm just gonna say it: there is no way I could be a woman. I'd kill someone.",2018-12-22 22:28:30
The joys of being a cosmetic laser technician,72,a6d8qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/a6d8qa/the_joys_of_being_a_cosmetic_laser_technician/,3,1544857261.0,"This is a series of stories, cause I don't want to spam. Feel free to move if it doesn't belong in here. There's a TL;DR and/or moral at the end of each story. Also sorry for format, phone posting 

*Story 1.*

Special at the time for laser hair removal on a certain area was 19 per treatment for a package of 5 treatments. Regular price was 39x5. 

Client: I've been here before, I should get a discount. 

Me: 19x5 is the discounted price, as we have a special at the moment. 

Client: but I've been here before, I should get a bigger discount! 

Me: 20 off each treatment is already a big discount, we don't actually go any lower than that for this area. 

Client: this is ridiculous, I am a regular member, I should get a discount! 

Me: *internal screaming*

This went in circles for a few more minutes until she demanded to speak to the manager, who told her the exact same thing I did. She eventually paid 19x5 for her treatments.

*Moral:* unless a place offers a discount for regulars, you are not special because you deign to grace us with your presence more than once. Also special offers are special. Don't look down your nose at them when the therapist could easily charge you full price for it... 

*Story 2*

Client comes in for laser hair removal. She's already paid for treatments in advance. Two therapists have already made it clear that they don't want to work with her, which should tell you something about what this client was like.

It's standard practise to offer ice packs during and after treatment, which can be used to cool the skin in conjunction with a cooling air machine during treatment. This particular client said no to the ice when I asked her first. Her notes also said that she usually didn't need it during treatment. 

About 5min into the treatment, she slaps my hand away. I am holding a piece of very expensive machinery, which she is extremely lucky I didn't drop. 

Client: I want ice! Now!

Me: -bites tongue, gets ice, treatment continues-

Me: could you turn your head for me? 

Client: PLEASE. 

Me: -bites tongue, repeats question with added please, she obliges, finish treatment without any more problems-

Me: now, I read in your file that you don't use aloe Vera? (which we usually recommend to soothe the skin and keep it hydrated. I wasn't selling, just applying some product after treatment)

Client: -looks at me like I'm some sort of moron- of course not. I want [other product]

Me: -obliges, gives her an ice pack to take home with her-

This is the point where she tries to leave without putting on sunblock. I wasn't trying to sell her any, we keep some in the rooms to apply after treatment free of charge. It is a mandatory step necessary to looking after your skin post-treatment. All of our clients know what they're signing up for and either use the one on offer or bring their own. 

Client: I don't want sunblock. 

Me: your skin is photo sensitive after treatment, you need sunblock to prevent possible pigmentation. 

Client: I'm not putting that on. 

I'm fed up arguing with her, so I let her go, and we leave the treatment room. 

Me: would you like to book your next appointment? You should be coming every four weeks. 

Client: no. 

Me: have a nice day, then. 

Eight weeks later she comes back with a few spots of pigmentation and a serious amount of regrowth. I let the head cosmetologist explain to her that the lack of sunblock caused the pigmentation, and the large amount of time between treatments caused the regrowth. 

*TL;DR:* rude client is rude. Argues with me at every step. Demands manners when she doesn't have any herself. Causes problems with her treatment because she won't listen to aftercare advice. We're not just telling you this stuff for sh*ts and giggles. 

*story 3*

Hair removal. Client has paid half the price of her prepays in her last treatment, and the remaining half is due in this treatment. 

Other therapist: you need to pay your remaining balance. 

Client: *deer in headlights* what?? 

OT: you have a balance of [amount]. You need to pay that today before you can continue with treatment.

C: I didn't know I'd have to pay that today (despite the fact that I told her she would in her last treatment, and she agreed to this. It was in her file, which was why other therapist was asking her) 

OT: unfortunately, yes, you do need to pay that today. 

C: I don't want that area now. Do I still have to pay? 

OT: since you've already paid half the amount for it, and it's been added to your account, we can't give you a refund. (it's against company policy to give refunds simply because the client doesn't want it any more. In that case, we tell them they can use the prepays for other areas, or as credit towards laser skin treatments) 

Client: well give me credit then. 

Other therapist agrees, and tells me I can add it to her account after treatment, since I'll be working with her. Not ten minutes into her treatment she's changed her mind, and decides she wants that area after all, and adds an extra 40 minutes onto her treatment time to get it done. She pays the original amount agreed upon, claiming that she would have had to pay it again sooner or later anyway, and leaves. 

*TL;DR:* client thought she could get out of paying the remaining balance for something by simply deciding she didn't want it any more. She realised this was a bad idea later when it occurred to her that we weren't just going to give her the money back. 

*Story 4*

I was running a bit late for one of my treatments, because I got stuck in another one (not the one above in story 3). Other therapist gets ripped a new arsehole because I am late, and it is somehow other therapists fault. So when I come out of my treatment, OT warns me that client is not a happy camper, and I'm probably going to get a bollocking. So out I go with no small amount of trepidation, preparing to get verbally battered. Client looks up at me, says ""I like your pants"" and goes in for her treatment without another word. For the curious, we don't wear uniforms, so that day I was wearing black bellbottoms with white daisies. They were pretty darn cute, but I didn't think they were THAT cute. Other therapist thinks those pants might be lucky XD 

*moral:* don't punish someone for something that is not their fault and say nothing to the actual object of your annoyance/frustration. That's not fair. I would have understood if the client was angry with me, but the other therapist did not deserve that. ",2018-12-15 09:01:01
The Tip That Made Me Quit,68,a5n8rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/a5n8rm/the_tip_that_made_me_quit/,6,1544654566.0,"I hope this belongs here, will (re)move it if not. Also, first post ever on here so please let me know if I'm missing something. This got longer than I expected, tl;dr at the end.

Little bit of background first. Back when I was in high school, I got a 'job' as a tourguide for horseback tours. I say 'job', because I did not get paid, except for tips. I would collect, groom and saddle the horses for the tours, while my colleague (an adult) would pick up the tourists and welcome them (signing waivers, paying, stuff like that). We'd give a short demonstration of how to handle a horse and then start moving people onto their assigned horses. My deal was that, in exchange for saddling the horses, I could come along on these tours. I was 15, we knew the owner/manager, so it started out as a pretty good deal.

In the 3ish years I've been there, the ranch went through 5 different tour guides. Because I helped out on Saturdays, and during the week it was slower, they were certain they only needed the one. Most of these tour guides were simply doing the best they could considering the circumstances. However, as soon as they went against the owner (often about how the horses should be cared for), they were gone. Again, MOST of these guides would share their tips with me, but this story is about the tip (and tour guide) that made me quit.

It had happened before that a tourist had personally given me a tip ($5 or $10) that I would put in my pouch in order to take home, and that I would discover later that the tip had disappeared. Once, this happened when I left my pouch lying on the bar while I went to the bathroom and I discovered on my home that my tip was gone. I had an inkling about who had done this, which was soon confirmed.

This particular Saturday morning was a smaller group, about 5 or 6, with mixed experience levels. One more inexperienced woman had been put on Charlie (not real name), a sweet but young Quarter Horse who was incredibly reliable except around quad bikes. I myself was on Woodstock (also not real name), who was what we called a 'tour guide horse', a horse that was harder to handle. She was younger, more inexperienced and more nervous around unexpected things. 

On our way back to the ranch, the inexperienced lady on Charlie had gotten scared because he was still excited after a short gallop, so I had taken his lead in my hand in order to calm him down. I had agreed with her that I would let the lead go when we were back on the trail, and we were on the last stretch of dirt road when a BIG quadbike tour came roaring by. 

As you might have guessed, Charlie got nervous. Nervous enough to start prancing around to lose some of his energy. Problem 1: I'm still holding his lead, so he's basically dancing around me and my horse. Problem 2: the combination of his nervousness and the quads got Woodstock (my horse) nervous as well. Now I have 2 incredibly excited horses, an inexperienced and scared rider, and the actual official tour guide far ahead in calm conversation with another tourist. Problem 3: Charlie had moved to my other side, so my one arm was twisted behind my back. I can't really remember how, but I think I let go of my reins in order to switch Charlie's lead to my other hand, grabbed my own reins back up again and somehow got my horse under control. The quads were gone by that time, so we trotted to the entrance of the trail and after making sure she was okay, we continued back to the ranch. 

I got a personal $20 tip from the lady on Charlie. She specifically sought me out and pressed the bill into my hands. After the tourists were gone however, the offical tour guide confronted me. Said that that tip was hers, because she was the tour guide. I could only sputter in retaliation. I was 15, this was a 30 year old woman getting mad at me for stealing her tips. Apparently, she claimed, ""the tips were her only source of income"". I tried to say that she hadn't deserved it, but she called the manager, and now I had 2 middle-aged ladies getting mad at me over 20(!) dollars. 

I caved, gave her the money, said goodbye to the horses, cried to my dad when he picked me up, and left a text during the week that said not to expect me again.

Tl;dr I personally get a well-earned $20 tip while working as volunteer horseback tourguide. Actual tourguide claims that tips are ""her only source of income"" and to give it to her, brings in manager who agrees. I haven't been back since.",2018-12-13 00:42:46
"Never work for a ""mom and pop"" hardware store.",46,a5mfnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/a5mfnv/never_work_for_a_mom_and_pop_hardware_store/,23,1544649390.0,"My first job was at a ""mom and pop"" hardware store, owned by a husband and wife who weren't parents. I was 16, and just needed a job, so my friend told me to apply and I'd more than likely get the job. During the whole hiring process, it took them about 3 weeks to get back to me. My friend said I was already hired they just forgot to actually call me back about it, which was mildly concerning, but no big deal. During the whole process of me getting ""papers signed"" (I was doing a 4th-grade math test to make sure I had the job), the ""mom"" told me I'd only be working 2 days a week, and since it was my first job, I'd be getting minimum wage. Being the dumb 16-year old I was, I thought it was smart; only work 2 days a week, still have time to focus on schoolwork, this job doesn't sound too bad.

&#x200B;

A few months go by, I was working hard, and there were just a few minor problems, mainly that I didn't know how to do a job. Because it was my first one. After the first 8 months or so, I started to notice that the ""mom"" really didn't like me. I'd do hard work, but any time I was ringing customers up she would tell me to go face everything in the store for the 10th time that hour, and smile and apologize to any customer she took over from me. As a (then) 17-year old, this upset me quite a bit, but I'm non-confrontational, so I just buried it down deep.

&#x200B;

A few more weeks go by, and I had to miss 2 Saturday shifts in a row because of family reasons. I didn't know I had to miss work until the night before or the day-of, so I always felt bad doing it and I explained what was happening. The ""mom"" wouldn't even let me finish my explanation most of the time and would hang up on me mid-sentence. Rude. The next Saturday, though, I could easily work, and I didn't work until noon so I planned to wake up around 10 to have some time before work. 5 minutes after I wake up, I get a call from ""mom""; ""Hey u/dxlta, can you come into work in the next 10 minutes? I have a funeral to go to right now that I forgot about. Thanks."" I told her I couldn't since I was with my family.

&#x200B;

First of all, this funeral was planned for about 3 weeks. I know this because it was a prominent figure in the town's local government. She COMPLETELY forgot about a funeral that was taking place that morning and tried to call me early asking me to come in early because she forgot about it. Really pissed me off, but water under the bridge.

&#x200B;

Since I was 17 at the time, I was still legally a minor. I had bad stomach problems one day at work, and had to go about 4 times during a 4-hour shift. I knew ""mom"" would get mad at me for having to go, so I waited until the store was empty to run back (also she had a rule where any time anybody had to use the bathroom, you had to tell her or ""dad."" weird) and drop one, so she, of course, knew about my 4 Little Boys. No big deal. A week goes by, and I just had to go real quick. I'm in there for no longer than 5 minutes, and when I walk back out, she tells me that I took too long and now only have a 15-minute lunch break since I was in the bathroom for 15 minutes (the state I live in legally requires a 30 minute, uninterrupted lunch break no later than the 5th hour of every 6+ hour shift for minors). I immediately knew that sounded illegal and went out to call my real mom and ask her what she was doing was wrong, and my mom almost drove to the store to yell at her, but I managed to calm her down.

&#x200B;

These past few events were within the span of my 10th month working at the store. During month 13 or so, I had another stomach attack,  did the whole explanation process, and she cut my lunch break shorter by \*20 minutes\*. I almost quit on the spot, but since I didn't have another job lined up, I was too afraid to leave right then and there. This happened every week until I got fired.

&#x200B;

I got ""let go,"" since I had a hard time showing up on time. What this means is that I came in 5 minutes late because of local construction a few times.

&#x200B;

There are a few more stories as to some things they did wrong, but those are the most prominent and irritating stories.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: don't work for a ""mom and pop"" hardware store if they're in their 60s, don't know what the internet is, and don't own a TV. More than likely they're insane and don't know the laws for minors.

She's a nurse in an old folks home, and a few years back she had this lovely old man come in that didn't speak a word of English 

Every few days when I caught up with her, she'd talk about this adorable old man that she could only communicate with through mime.
He would smile at her, babble away in his native tongue and giggle at the end of every single sentence.
The old bugger was quickly becoming one of her favourite patients.

Anyway fast forward a week, she turns up to the pub and something is clearly off with her.
They'd gotten somebody to come in and translate for him and he turned out to be a really interesting individual.

Apparently the guy has witnessed some horrific war crimes in his village as a young kid that had left him severely fucked up.
The whole time he was talking to her and the other nurses, he was saying how tasty they all looked and he'd love to cut them up to cook and eat.
Transferred him quick smart to a better suited place to deal with his issues and she never heard anything about him after that.

Randomly just remembered this just this morning, I'll have to ask her about him next time I see her",2018-12-12 00:53:51

lc also doesn’t count the drawer down at shift change. i have to do both. it’s not quite fair to me to be doing both of our jobs because she’s too lazy to do so besides stand at the counter and do her job halfassed and kiss SMs ass when they walk back up. 
she’s also rude to customers and slow and holds us back because she refuses to comprehend  and i’m contemplating going to management.

A few stories from a young intern at an environmental office.,54,9vcw06,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9vcw06/a_few_stories_from_a_young_intern_at_an/,5,1541704076.0,"First time poster here, sorry if formatting is bad, writing this on mobile.

A year or so ago, I got a summer job as a paid intern at my local environmental office. I live on a Native American reservation, so it's surprisingly busy here. Alongside normal things like typing up reports and other intern-y things, I was normally out in the fields or alongside the road, picking up whatever people dumped there. Here's a few highlights:

-My first day, I went with a coworker to drive around and give me an overview of what I was expected to do. The guy realizes first impressions are important, so he runs over a cat on our way back to the office. ""Oops.""

-A few days after that, my boss drove me around places to pick up garbage and dumped trash. It was in a really slow golf-cart-like vehicle, so we had enough time to notice something weird and cubeish hidden in some bushes. Turns out it was a safe. With a cash register nearby. From a place 50+ miles away.

-We got a call once about a lot of garbage bags being found alongside the road. Me and a different coworker were told to clean it up. When we arrived, we checked what was inside the bags. All 7 bags were filled to the brim with LITERAL FECES. I threw up a little in my mouth after realizing that. To make matters worse, the cart we use to transport what we pick up decided now would be the best time to stop working. We called our boss who came out to help, who then had to call another person to fix it.

-There was a conference call from representatives of some Environmental Board (or something like that) and everyone in my office besides me had to take part. I asked what I was supposed to do and was told to take a scrap piece of paper and make notes of important things. That's fine I thought, maybe they'll review it later just in case. The call finishes up and I ask my boss what to do with the paper. ""Oh you can just hold on to that, we don't need it."" W e l l .

This was just off the top of my head, I could probably think of some more if you guys are interested. ",2018-11-08 21:07:56

This particular customer, we do a certain run for them a couple of times a week that delivers into a mall store. We have to bring it to the ground (no dock access), take it inside, unpack it, verify the boxes individually, etc. Everything is charged based on weight and the dimensions on the skids are always large, so the dim weight we charge by is always higher than the actual weight. The higher the weight, the more money it costs of course.   


So the last couple, they've just \*conveniently\* left the dimensions off the paperwork so I won't know the dims and can't do the math to charge them for it.  However, the dimensions are on the paperwork from the airline where we pick it up from. So I just used those.   


The guy in charge of the account calls and is all in a huff that I charged them this 'outrageous' dim weight that he says I 'can't justify' because 'there are no dimensions on the paperwork'.

So awhile ago, I was working at the customer service desk at a very large, family-oriented attraction (with free admission). This place increased their staff exponentially during the busy season (late spring through early fall), and the majority of the staff were teenagers. As I said, this place was huge, so in summer, we easily had over 1000 employees. Since most only worked there a couple of months, we didn't keep a directory of every employee - - only permanent employees were on the list. I worked there for a couple years, so I was very familiar with the place, but even I wasn't considered permanent. Working at the info desk, I got asked weird, random questions all the time, and amazingly, I was often able to answer them. But one day in late spring, a girl really stumped me. She came up to the desk, and she looked to be in the 14-16 year age range. This is the conversation that took place:  

G: Hi. I'm looking for my friend Katelyn. 
Me: OK. Have you gotten separated? 
G: No. She works here. 
Me: OK. Do you know where she works? 
G: No. 
Me: OK. Do you know what department she works in? What she does here? 
G: No. She wears a hat. 
Me: (thinking that describes about 80% of our staff) Umm. OK. Do you know her last name? 
G: No. We go to school together. She's in my class. She said I should come up here and visit her at work. Can't you look her up or something?
Me: Well, we don't keep a directory with every employee listed. Only the permanent management is listed. 

Just then my supervisor walked up, and asked what was going on, so I relayed the story thus far. 

S: So you want us to tell you where your friend is, but you don't know her last name, what she does here, or what part of the park she works in? 
G: Yeah. I can tell you what she looks like. She's 16, wears her hair in a ponytail, and has kind of chubby cheeks when she smiles. 
Me: Well, we don't know everyone who works here, so I'm not sure we'll be able to help you. 
S: Yeah, we have over a thousand employees, and you just described almost half of them. Without more information, we have no idea who or where your friend is. 
G: Can you just page her or something? 
S: No, we only have an emergency alert system. Besides, even if we could page her, we would need her last name. I have a feeling she's probably not the only Katelyn here today.  But you're more than welcome to go into the park and look for her. It's free to go in. 
G: No, that's OK. I guess I'll just see her at school. 

The girl left, and my supervisor and I just looked at each other. First, how do you not know your friend's last name? You've presumably been in school with her all year! Second, how did you expect us to figure out who and where she is with virtually no information? We definitely don't know every employee, and we definitely don't have any magical ""find-the-person"" super powers. And third, if it's important enough to you that you come all the way up here, and you're trying to get us to figure out some random person, why wouldn't you just go in and look? After thinking about it for a while, we thought maybe she could have been looking for this girl to harass her or something (though probably not). It was just really weird.

The emperor has no clothes.,39,9r4i1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9r4i1o/the_emperor_has_no_clothes/,4,1540420692.0,"As children, we all read the story ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".  So Mike is the emperor, and well, he's naked and can't admit it.  Mike's been in charge of this software project since its inception five years ago.  He has made most of the decisions how it was to be built and participates in the building.  There are about three dozen users, although only about eight use it daily.  The sponsor who championed its deployment, retired four months ago.

My project, by no fault of my own, closed down about a year ago.  Mike's server guy was soon to retire, and I had some experience, so I was given the choice to join Mike's group, or go looking for another job.  I had never seen how their system was put together, but had heard a pretty impressive sales pitch for it, so I figured I would make a go of it.  I could always go looking later.

So I'm an experienced software architect with over thirty years of experience.  That experience helps me understand that any project grows cruft and technical debt.  Finding that in Mike's project was pretty easy.  I know better than in my first few months to be the bull in the china cabinet, pointing out every issue I find.  But I soon realized they are everywhere.  I ask Mike about some of the more obvious things, expecting him to say something like, ""Yeah, we had to make choices between multiple evils.""  But much to my chagrin, he expressed pride in the choices made, and obviously expected me to compliment him and keep up the pretense of his beautiful design.

Now I could just act like I see his clothes, or I could start making suggestion for design changes.  I took that latter tactic about three months ago.  At first, Mike just listened politely, but ignored anything I said or asked for.  So I have ratcheted up how aggressive my points are presented continuously, now having held more design review team meetings in the past two months than Mike held over the past year.

My other coworkers can see what's happening.  The most senior, three years on the team, is also retiring in two months.  He's not exactly ready to go to battle and call him naked.  Another has only been on the team two months longer than myself and seems to be content to just say the clothes are there.  The last team member only joined this month, and so is naturally confused by everything.

This saga will no doubt continue for some time.  I don't feel like I'm at risk, either from Mike, our users, or our common boss since I do know what I'm talking about.  I'm contemplating getting to the point of telling him he is outright naked by the end of the year, but I'm not sure he will even understand.  Mike's been drinking his own Kool-Aide for so long that he is convinced that everything is fine.",2018-10-25 01:38:12
I hate closing with my coworker,133,9r43q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9r43q0/i_hate_closing_with_my_coworker/,19,1540417813.0,"This is my first post here, and I just want to have a quick rant about my coworker. I started working at a popular restaurant that may or may not rhyme with ""shmunkin shmonuts"" about a month and a half ago, I just needed something temporary after my seasonal job ended before I find something that pays more. Anyways, I work closing shifts with this one girl who I will call ""Amy"". Amy is a nice girl and at first I didn't mind working with her. But as I've learned the in's and out's of closing shifts, I've realized how much she SUCKS at this job. I should have realized when our manager decided to make me PM shift leader only three weeks into the job. Turns out, it was so I would be in charge of making sure she actually does her job. When we close, I end up doing a majority of the work while she sits on her phone in the back of the store. When I try and ask her to do something (ex. ""Amy can you collapse these boxes in the back so we can recycle them"") I have to remind her at least five times to actually get her to do it. It's become so common for her to procrastinate closing duties that we end up having to stay nearly an hour late just to finish cleaning and closing the store. So I have started making a checklist of things each of us have to do before we leave. When I finish everything that needs to be done early, I leave right when we close and and I'm like ""Ok bye have fun staying late to do your part I guess"". I have decided to leave the checklist from each night on our managers desk so when things aren't done, she's the one who gets reprimanded instead of me. 
BY THE WAY: I've been working there for less than two months and she has been there for almost two years. I can't believe she hasn't been fired. Fuck you Amy
UPDATE: I quit so it doesn’t matter lmao",2018-10-25 00:50:13
Worst customer experiences,67,9qun7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9qun7l/worst_customer_experiences/,3,1540339721.0,"I think we’ve all had our fair share. Why are yours? Maybe you were the bad customer. Share it regardless.

My worst one was during a Sunday shift at the zoo I work at. I don’t know what it is about Sundays, but families always swarm the zoo on that specific day. While I have no problem with families, I do have a problem with families who are rude and demand special treatment. So now I want you to imagine a horde of aggressive families mixed with baby boomers. Yeah, you get the idea. I was working the new Jaguar exhibit that day. I’m part of the education team, so my job is just to sit in front of or near an exhibit and list cool facts about the animal. Keep in mind that this is only the second day this exhibit has been open to the public, and not even the entire public at that. The only way you were allowed to view the exhibit on this specific day was if you were a member. Not an employee, just someone who paid to become a member on the website. The two original Jaguars, Inca and Zian, has recently given birth to 2 cubs (Diego and Luna). This was the cub’s first time out on exhibit, so obviously they were stressed. The keepers made sure to leave the door to their off exhibit area that was indoors open. The cubs spent most of the day inside, and would occasionally come out. Apparently this didn’t suit well with a specific group of parents who literally cornered me. First Lady to approach me was a walking soccer Mom stereotype. Mid 30s, pink tank top, blond bowl haircut, sunglasses, etc. She walks up to me and pretty much demands to see the cubs

Mom: Where are the cubs?

Me: They’re currently off exhibit right now, but you might see them if you come back later. In the mean time, we have a bunch of other animals in this exhi-

Mom: Why are they inside!?

Me: They’re only about 6 months old each. This is their first time being in exhibit, so they’re both very nervous and stressed out. We left the indoor exhibit entrance open so they can go inside if they get stressed out. 

Mom: Just bring them out! 

*Entire group of adult is surrounding me right now yelling at me*

Group: We only came to see the cubs!!

This is what I found absolutely fucking absurd. The Jags aren’t the only animals in the huge ass exhibit. You have collared lizards, tree frogs, a psychedelic toad, quails, burrowing owls, a hawk, a badass turkey culture, and a fucking ocelot. And you only wanna see the cubs? Fuck outta my face. Obviously I didn’t say this lol.

Me: I can’t bring them out, and I also can’t tell the keepers to bring them out because I don’t have the authority to do so. Please, if you want to see the cubs, come back at a later hour. They’ve gone inside by their choice.

Mom: My kids want to see the cubs so badly! (Meanwhile her kids are transfixed by hawk and vulture lmao)

This one smartass grandma in a wheelchair started mocking me in a high pitched voice. That pissed me off. 

It’s unbelievable how fucking entitled some people are. These parents got to see this attraction before anyone else could. The rest of the public wouldn’t be able to view it for another week, and here you are bitching about one animal not being out for your viewing. Eat a dick.


My second bad encounter happened a year earlier when I was working as a scare actor at a haunted attraction in my State, aka the most fun job in the world. I was 15 at the time. I played a character called the the stalker. The name is self explanatory. I would single out a certain group, and follow them around. This group in question consisted of 3 people. 2 girls (probably in their 20s) and one huge 6 foot tall guy. They were in line. I went up to them, and just stared for a good 8 minutes. The girls were getting freaked out but also laughing, but I could tell this dude was not having it. I eventually left and followed some other people around. About 30 minutes later, I see these 3 again and decide to follow them again. The girls scream and laugh when they see me. “Oh shit he found us again” Fun right? All of a sudden, the guy whips around, storms up to me, and tells me to get lost or else. Here’s this 6 foot tall tough guy talking down a fucking 15 year old kid for giving them exactly what they paid money for. I’ll admit that I should’ve steered clear from them after I saw the guy’s facial expression the first time. But still, there’s no need to get violent.",2018-10-24 03:08:41

I just had a lengthy conversation with a student on the phone who was very dissatisfied with how the school's financial aid department sat on some of his paperwork for a month without processing it, for no good reason.  Consequently, he was dropped from his courses for non-payment, then re-instated later when FA realized their mistake.  The student is unsure whether he wants to continue taking his courses, and had questions about the timing of the refund he's now due since FA got off their butts and paid out.

I was able to de-escalate him, thankfully he was irritated but not totally off the deep end.  This is all like, super super late in the process here and he has a right to be mad if what he says is true (though to be fair i have no idea if it is).  I tell him the truth about our refund processing time, answer some of his questions, listen to him vent a bit (he's being polite about it so I'm ok with listening).  I also point him towards the academic petition process so he does have another option if things all go downhill.

It all wraps up on a positive note.  I tell him I'll give him a call when the direct deposit is processed, and after that it'll be 3-5 business days.  He thanks me for my time, I wish him a good weekend, etc.

I hang up.

My boss turns to me from her office and calls out, ""you know students get an email from $university when they get a direct deposit refund issued, so you don't have to call that guy.  The email says to expect it in 2 days after that.""

I tell her that's really good to know and that I think I'll still call this guy anyway just because the personal touch will go a long way with him.

She adds, not responding to that, ""I don't even know if we wanna issue this guy a refund anyway, if he drops his classes and the financial aid gets reversed then we're the ones holding the bag.""

I honestly don't even know what to say to something like that, I think I stammered out something about like, if we're not going to issue him a refund then I just lied to him on the phone.  She said: ""Well you can only work with the best info you have at the time.""

what

How about a little communication?  Or, if you're not going to be involved until after the fact, maybe don't just swoop in and undo everything without knowing everything that's gone on with the situation?

At least her calling out things to me from her office is a refreshing change from her hovering directly behind me on every. single. phone call.  Like she was doing for my first 6 months.",2018-10-13 02:05:46
"Supervisor assigns project, then fights me on every step of project [long]",35,9nos83,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9nos83/supervisor_assigns_project_then_fights_me_on/,7,1539383113.0,"I'm the head cashier at a university. Prior to our current bursar taking over, there was basically no collections or A/R process that was consistently adhered to; it was catch-as-catch-can, with no documentation. People were writing little scribbled notes to themselves on the outside of students' file folders, that kind of thing. We have outstanding debt from I don't know how long ago, nobody knows exactly how much, and it's all over the place.  Our current bursar is at least making an effort, but it's still a mess.

At my previous job, this was exactly my wheelhouse. Both collections in particular as well as compliance in general, or as I like to call it, bringing order to chaos. I'm the low woman on the totem pole here, but I took some initiative and set to working on it. I talked with my supervisor, the bursar, about me doing this. She had previously agreed that I could do my thing, but gave me no direction as to how. Not that I needed it, this is just to illustrate that it seemed like it was going to be a hands-off project where I could take the reigns and get us straightened out.

First thing I do is take a look at the shared network drive's ""collections"" folder.  It's an absolute mess, of course, no organization whatsoever, no written procedures that I can find, just a jumble of random PDFs and Word documents like the inside of a junk drawer.

I start cleaning things up, and go to give my boss an update on what I'm finding.  She tells me not to touch anything in there, that she has it ""organized"" the way it is for a reason and knows where everything is.  Um, ok.  I ask her where our collections procedures are, and she replies ""They're in there somewhere.""

I go back and look again, and lo and behold, there are indeed some written procedures, but they're another satellite campus's procedures, with no alterations for our situation here.  In other words, maybe if someone knew nothing about how to report debt to an agency, this might help a little.  But it's unacceptable for this to be our policy document.

I report a diplomatically-phrased version of this to my boss, who tells me it's ""not a priority"" and not to worry about it.  Me: ok...

Fast forward to a few weeks ago: I go to give my boss an update on the project.
>Me: So, $Boss, I've cobbled together a spreadsheet where we can track our collections process through from start to finish. I've got a prototype saved to the department network drive, if you'd like to take a look. I'd like to start populating it with the information from our hard copy collections files in the back.

>Boss: Oh, yeah, we have to set up some kind of list. It should have [such and such info].

>Me: Yep, that's all already in there, did you want to look at the draft and tell me if it's to your liking?

>Boss: A list would be great. Have you tried looking at the electronic reports we get from $CollectionsCompany1 and $CollectionsCompany2? They have the right kind of information that we need. Oh we should really start working these and getting more of these students sent off.

>Me: ... Yes, exactly, I agree. (Internally: what the heck) If you could please take a look at the list I've made...?

>Boss: Yeah we should really get a list. [trails off mumbling to herself]

She did eventually look at the list (we're talking like, two days later) and decided it was fine, so I moved forward on digitizing the files and collecting the information.  Fast-forward to yesterday.  I'm showing one of my subordinates the process for entering this information from the paper folders into the spreadsheet.  $Boss comes out of her office, interrupting her own work.

> $Boss: What's this you're working on?

> Me: That collections master list you approved a while back.  I've been populating it with info, but I figured I could put $Cashier on it as well.

> $Boss: Why not just use the electronic reports that are in the drive already?

> Me, struggling to comprehend what could prompt such a question: ... Because I think it would be helpful, and I thought you agreed, to have a centralized bird's-eye view of our entire collections situation, not just periodic reports from the companies that are all separate?

> $Boss: Just saying, you could work from those and then see if what we have in the drawers matches the reports.

> Me: ... We'll probably have to do that anyway, you're right, but I'd like to start by digitizing the paper files.

> $Boss: Just a suggestion!  You know, if you wanted to do it that way, you could start with the electronic stuff.

> Me: Okay, thanks $Boss.

All this in front of my subordinates.  

Fast-forward to today.  I spent a non-trivial amount of time this morning setting up the spreadsheet to automatically highlight entries that have debt older than certain year thresholds (tricky, because of how our campus codes for our academic terms, it's not just a straightforward date system), because what we can do with the debt changes as it ages.  I mention this to $Boss, and her response?  ""... Okay?""

""Okay?"" Like a question.  After a long pause.  Like, ""what do you want me to do with this information"".

Soooo, it's my project and well within my area of expertise, buuuut I can't clean up the folders, can't rewrite the policy, can't conduct it the way I want, nothing I do gets acknowledged, understood or appreciated, and I can't put my subordinates on it without constant interference.  Cool.  Totally a healthy work environment, this.

The worst part is, I haven't even really begun to work on this.  This is the first step, the basics of the basics before we can really start working the A/R and getting our money coming in.  And it's already this much of a hassle.  I'm about ready to give up working on it.  If this is how she wants to play it, she can just do it all herself, then.

UPDATE: This morning (10/18), after an email exchange where I confirmed everything I've been working on and gave her a status update, my boss literally up and canceled the project, saying ""it's not worth the time to re-invent the wheel"".  OH GOOD",2018-10-13 01:25:13
Nonsense of La Raza Inc,41,9mo1ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9mo1ao/nonsense_of_la_raza_inc/,7,1539081379.0,"I've posted this elsewhere, but I want to be sure I post it in the correct page. 

This is long, and I normally don't vent on reddit, but I wanted to share the nonsense we've been dealing with as many people as I can.

Let me be clear. I'M NOT SPEAKING AGAINST EVERY PIZZA HUT location, just the one's franchised by THIS corporation.

If you live in the united states, Never, EVER work for La Raza.

The amount of incompetence and lack of professionalism that stretches all the way to their corporate headquarters in Texas astounds me.

Every Pizza Hut may be like this, I don't know, but this is my personal experience with La Raza/Yum Brands Pizza Hut:

I worked in store as a manager. When I first started, I was making minimum wage but was satisfied as they gave me more than enough hours, even had opportunities for overtime. That aspect was awesome.

However, the more competant I proved to be, the higher the expectations rose. There were managers working there who just didn't cut it, and the GM, let's call her Donna, desperately wanted me to become a manager myself. She did eventually talk me into it. 

That's when the bullshit started.

Almost as soon as she made me a manager, she left and became our area coach. A new GM came in but he was more of a hands on manager so you got to dig that.

When I completed my training and became a manager, they tried to replace me on the make table. They couldn't. People who were coming in were over using product and costing the store money. The employee turnover rate didn't help with that either. A hot box pizza and things similar to that opening in the area was starting to kill the once booming location as the cherry on top.

When I first began working there in 2013, it was a dine in pizza hut with a lunch buffet and a Wing Street.

By the time I left just a few months ago, they no longer offered a buffet and couldn't afford servers or anything related to the service portion of being a restaurant, and a lot was cut from the store's over all budget. The wingstreet was still there when i left, but there was active talks of getting rid of it.

The one silver lining is I met my girlfriend of 4 years there, and I will say this, she is a better employee than me.

Back in February of this year, our area coach made an overhaul decision. She replaced salary managers in that store: two Assistant managers (one being my girlfriend) and the GM. I remained behind as I was just an hourly in store manager. 

There was a team meeting called of all the managers in store where the area coach introduced us to the new GM. This GM was this diamond in the rough employee, hand picked by Donna for this position(This woman's name can be Samantha) This woman was a nightmare. I don't know how she was trained, but somehow she got it in her head that all corners can and must be cut.

On Mondays, I would double as a manager and cook, as business was never so hectic that I couldn't handle it. When she saw this, she got it in her head that it could work that way every night.  So she stopped making an attempt to find decent employees, and just decided to have me double as both cook and manager.

I wasn't completely opposed to the idea, but i did explain to her that weekends, I would need help, which she said she understood.

Two weeks went by with this idea process. Then I got my first check. For the two weeks I had agreed to play both roles, I was coming in and clocking in as a manager. My paycheck was about $150 short, and I knew I had been working more hours than previous, so it didn't make sense. When I looked at my actual hours, it showed I had been earning only minimum wage, when by that point I was earning almost $11 hourly as a manager. 

I brought this up to Samantha, and she didn't have a single problem letting me know she had been reclocking me in as a line cook to save money.

THE. FUCKING. AUDACITY.

The first thing I did was walk to my car, call the area coach and explain everything exactly how I just explained it. Her tone about the whole situation was as if i was a child talking about a fish I caught. She didn't believe me. I told her I have proof in hand and explained what was said to me. 

All she could say was ""I'll have to look into that, until then try not to maintain a professional atmosphere in the kitchen.""

AS IF I WAS GOING TO WALK BACK IN THERE TO WORK.

I called the La Raza corporate office located in my state. Talked to some country woman,  (Audrey). Told her what was going on and she gave me the same tone as Donna. Didn't want to believe me I guess. When I explained that it was beyond the boundaries of being illegal her response was

""I've worked with Donna for almost 20 years, and I can't see her doing that.""

I'm not talking about Donna, I'm talking about my paycheck. I'm talking about Samantha. Donna isn't doing anything for me, and I want this resolved before I return to work. (This is how I felt)

I asked if there was someone above her I could call and she directed me to the corporate offices in Texas, who, to explain things quick, encouraged me to call my local La Raza and inform them of the situatio.

I was getting sent in circles. I did not return to work. That was June.

My girlfriend remained with them. When she left my store, she trained and became a GM at another store and completely flipped their store for the better.

About a month ago, there were talks from Donna about placing her in a store, literally 50 miles north from the current store she was at. My gf was apprehensive, but accepted as they offered her a raise.

She got to that store, and the man who had been there running it for over a decade had completely screwed things up. It was obvious to anyone with an ability to look at numbers and inventory that this man was writing things off to embezzle money. My girlfriend even brought this fact up to the area coach, and Donna acknowledged it like she already knew. From that, the interpretation my gf got, is that they were so desperate for someone competent and trustworthy, that they started begging her.

WRONG!

My girlfriend got fired a few days ago for stealing money from the store, based on an investigation that had been going on for months. MONTHS. When I asked her how come Donna wasn't standing up for her and protecting her valuable employees, she shrugged, cried and said she didn't know.

I said fuck that. You can't justify this shit Donna.

I went out of my way to find that woman on facebook to message her because I wanted answers on all her bullshit. She loves to just write people off at a moment's notice, fucking up someone's life in the process and I was completely tired of that aspect of her personality. She treated her job like she ran some small town restaurant, when in reality she was the area coach for over a dozen of them. She had no professional fortitude as far as the description of her job was concerned.

I found her. Who do I see in her profile pic? The manager my girlfriend replaced. These two 50+ year old people, crawling all over each other like teenagers who have never been laid. Whose in the comments talking about how they make a cute couple? 

MOTHERFUCKING SAMANTHA

 The guy was tagged, so I clicked on his profile, just to be sure it was him. Had to make sure I wasn't making a knee jerk reaction. I saw he had his employment as working at the pizza hut my gf came from....

.....wut?

The GM was allowing her boyfriend to steal from the company she worked for and when she was about to get caught up in a bunch of crap, she threw my girlfriend under the bus as a scapegoat. I pointed that out to her in the message i sent, while also reminding her that I had still be dicked over by Samantha's bullshit. I was blocked. Clicked the man's profile just to see. Blocked there too.

Samantha as well....

Just today, I called the Texas location, pissed and demanding to speak to someone who wasn't going to give me the run around. The person that answered, gave me something like this

""Thank you for calling La Raza Corporate Headquarters, located at (wherever the fuck they are) my name is (name) how can I assist you?""

Explained every, little detail. Figured maybe they'd like to know that they had a couple working for them, stealing from them. I did my best to make them understand that this was clearly a problem they needed to deal with. Not just mine. The person acted like they understood, then I asked about our own employment and she clarified that our employment had been terminated by the area coach and that whatever the decision was on getting our jobs back had to go through the local coporate location, as it was something too small for the main headquarters, and she didn't want me getting lost in the fold. I can respect that explanation.

Obviously I didn't bother to do that.

This was my experience working for La Raza. 

NOTE: I am NOT SEEKING LEGAL ADVICE. I've been in a situation similar to this before and I already know how I'm going to handle it. This is purely ME VENTING and trying to WARN any people looking for decent employment that don't have college experience, that there are places that simply don't and won't give a fuck. 

La Raza franchises other restaurants such as KFC and Burger King, so I was thinking maybe someone else out there had a SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.

If you did, share it.

Venting ten months of frustration and literal agony,36,9mcmtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9mcmtp/venting_ten_months_of_frustration_and_literal/,7,1538981777.0,"Warning in advance - it's a long read. Ten months' worth of information condensed into one story, with only one direct quote because of how long it is. Putting it into Word results in 4 pages, but I feel like it's deserving of being on this site. It's a wild ride for sure.

&#x200B;

I used to work for an international laboratory company, one of the biggest names in the world. I didn't process specimens in my position, though I was cross-trained to do so if anyone in that department was on vacation. My job was to transfer information from doctors' paper orders for testing into the company's database so that other, licensed individuals would know what the test was supposed to be looking for.

&#x200B;

The company requires rigorous amounts of typing. I was recently re-tested as 80 WPM and 10,000 or so KPH on a 10-key, though I probably average about 60 WPM (KPH is accurate). Even with those speeds, I had a hard time consistently making the production requirements of the position due to how short they were. We had to process one order every 34 seconds on average.

&#x200B;

Additionally, overtime was mandatory - since we were dealing with literal life and death situations, we needed to begin the process for every specimen we received on the same day we received it, meaning that we had to finish all work that came in before we were allowed to leave. I was told this when I first started, and specifically told that we would be probably having one or two days a week where we would be staying maybe a half an hour to 45 minutes overtime. An hour at most.

&#x200B;

I worked at the position for over a year and everything was going smooth, but then our supervisor had to transfer to another position to focus on her family, which I totally understand and don't blame her for. I had some minor issues, though, like how the chair I had to work on was painfully hard, and the lowest it would go was about the width of my thighs from the bottom of the desk I had to work on. I am not a short individual, so I had to stretch in order to reach the keyboard or slouch down in a rigid chair and put pressure on my lower spine. I asked multiple times for a better chair from my manager, but I was told that the only kind of chair HR would let them order was the one I was already using.

&#x200B;

However, that transfer caused our workload to increase substantially. Instead of once or twice a week, half an hour overtime... we were having daily overtime. And not half an hour to 45 minutes, I'm talking more along the lines of ""shortest was hour and a half, longest was three and a half hours overtime in a single day"". On top of that, we wouldn't know how long we would be there until about two hours before the shift was ""supposed"" to end, just based on how much work was left. It doesn't stop there, either - we had to get express permission if we had to leave ""early"" (by which I mean before our coworkers - even for our own doctor appointments or other non-work obligations we had to meet; the actual time that the shift was scheduled to stop didn't matter at all). And we weren't allowed an extra break at end of shift, either - every time I asked, I was met with ""if we gave one to you, we'd have to give one to everyone because it's not fair, and we all want to get out of here as soon as possible."" I eventually stopped asking.

&#x200B;

Well, my body seemed to be severely unhappy with the new working conditions. Instead of having two hours of work followed by 15 minutes of rest (half hour for lunch break), I was suddenly having to keep up speeds of 60+ WPM and 12,000+ KPH for three and a half to five hours at a time, on a chair that was forcing my body to stretch in a very unnatural position.

&#x200B;

Within two weeks, my right hand started to hurt. After three, a muscle in my wrist pinched a nerve, leading to similar symptoms as carpal tunnel syndrome. That day tied when I broke my arm for the highest pain I have ever felt in my life. My hand seemed to only be sending pain signals to my brain, and not receiving any movement signals in return.

&#x200B;

I asked to be excused to make a phone call, called my parents and had my dad come pick me up (I worked an hour away from home, it was quite a trip and he missed work that day as a result), then went back in to continue working. Fortunately, my team lead saw how bad I was and asked if I just wanted to go home. I told her that I was in so much pain, and that my hand couldn't move, so I wouldn't be able to drive myself. However, I did take the offer since I wouldn't have been able to work anyway, then went out to wait for my father to get me and take me to a doctor for treatment.

&#x200B;

During all of this, the building was under remodeling, so the signs for how to handle worker's compensation weren't at eye level. I had no idea what I was doing (first full-time, non-temporary job), and frankly the only thing going through my mind at the time anyway was ""PAIN PAIN PAIN MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP PLEASE"". I get home, try and call HR for help with worker's compensation after seeing a doctor (who isn't even part of worker's comp, but I didn't know that when going in - obviously, this led to even more complications). No answer; in fact, I didn't get a call back until I went back into work the next week with a doctor's note.

&#x200B;

I go into work, get the paperwork filled out, and go home. The next day, I come in with a note stating my current work restrictions - unable to use right hand for typing. My manager said ""We can't accommodate that, just go home."" That is the direct quote.

&#x200B;

After two weeks pass, I hear back from the insurance company for worker's compensation - denied, as it was a ""pre-existing condition"" even though the doctor that they told me to go to said it was caused by work. Doesn't matter, since I had to go into my own doctor for it beforehand even though I had no clue what I was supposed to do in the situation, I guess it would be counted as pre-existing. At this point I've had enough and start seeking legal counsel (my hand is no better than it was the day I left work).

&#x200B;

I find a highly recommended attorney and get in for a free consultation. He assures me that he believes that my case is very strong and likely to win, but it would take about seven months to do so and I wouldn't be able to get any treatment in the interim. I only have about three months' worth of funds stowed away at the time, so I have to end up just dropping it entirely for monetary reasons (also, let's be honest - I don't want to be in agonizing pain every time I have to even shower for the next seven months).

&#x200B;

The next day, I get a letter from HR saying that I need to come in to work or be terminated, since I haven't called out since the day I was literally told by my manager to ""just go home"". I call, and find out that even though I filed a worker's comp claim, and brought in a note, I would still have to file for FMLA and short-term disability, which I am not currently enrolled in. I missed the enrollment period for the year since it was during the time RIGHT after our supervisor left, but I manage to get an exception with the actual benefits company and get signed up.

&#x200B;

I end up going on my own insurance instead and seeing a wrist specialist. By the time I go to start disability, though, I find out that it doesn't activate until I go back into work. Still no income as a result. Fortunately, my hand starts to heal around the middle of January. Within half of a month from then I'm able to work again (hand injury itself was in mid-October, for reference), which is good because money is running seriously dry at this point.

&#x200B;

I get back to work and within the first week I'm there we have another person leaving (three days in was her last day; she had apparently put her two weeks in JUST in time for when I came back). She was a dynamo worker, too - she had the speed of TWO workers by herself. Without her or the supervisor, our department is essentially cut in half. And within two days of returning, my hand starts hurting again... only this time my left hand starts acting up as well (it hadn't before). This is the point I realize that my wrist problems are most probably being caused by the ergonomics issue I had asked to be solved repeatedly but never been accommodated for.

&#x200B;

Sure enough, I get another appointment with the wrist specialist and he agrees with me. I get a note saying that I am not to do any overtime unless the ergonomics are fixed... within the same day they had moved me to a different desk (the one vacated two days prior by dynamo). Sure enough, that fixes all of the problems... for now.

&#x200B;

See, over the course of the previous four months, my depression has returned with a massive vengeance. For the first time in my life, I am having suicidal thoughts, and it scares me a lot. I get that treated, and start to see both a psychiatrist and a psychologist for the first time since I had left high school five years before. I'm also formally diagnosed with OCD at this time, something I've always believed I had but never been officially diagnosed with it (I was diagnosed with Asperger's at the age of six, but not the things that often come underlying WITH it).

&#x200B;

A couple months pass before we get a new replacement coworker. He lasts for about six weeks then stops showing up entirely. By this time, my stress is through the roof. My day consists of ""barely get out the door in time, get food on the way (gaining weight because of how unhealthy my eating habits have become), drive an hour to work, work for 10+ hours, drive an hour home, go to sleep, repeat"". After a couple more weeks of that, my body starts to give up entirely. Daily headaches, nausea, yet I still go into work every day because I don't want to feel like I'm abandoning my team. My typing abilities are slipping and I'm being reprimanded for them at this point.

&#x200B;

One day, though, near the beginning of July, I have a massive headache. Sensitive to light, sound, movement, the works. I can't even listen to my music (one of the few GOOD things about this job - we were allowed to listen to music while working), and have to turn my monitor's brightness down as far as it goes. An hour into work, my left eye stops working properly, and I'm forming headaches in places I've never had them before. You know the phrase ""seeing red""? That literally happened - almost like the green and blue cones in my left eye stopped working entirely. Top that with the light sensitivity and it just makes everything even worse. I work for another hour with one eye, and then contact my team lead to speak to a manager so that I can quit. I put in my two weeks, leaving myself a clause to get out early if my health continues to stay as bad as it is. I'm only 24 at this point but feel like I'm in danger of having a stroke!

&#x200B;

I missed the rest of that day of work, along with calling out the next. I come in the following day, and near the end of the day I ended up walking out that door forever. This is July, nine months after the injury and ten months after our supervisor left. We STILL have two vacancies in the department - supervisor and team member. I feel like there were definitely at least three points I could've sued, and won, but again... don't have the time or money to do that.

&#x200B;

And, I know this is going to make some people doubt the entire story but I swear I am not making this up - two days after I left for good, the company was hit by a massive data breach, losing the information of literally MILLIONS of patients. I only know this because I tried calling them back on Monday to attempt to see if anyone would be willing to help give me a professional reference (I had at least decent relationships with my coworkers, even if we rarely talked - I feel like my team lead, at least, would be willing to help), and the phone system was just looping constantly. I Googled to try and find their corporate number and the first result was \[Company Name\] Hacked, with articles dating back only 14 hours at the time. If it was this bad BEFORE the hack, I can't even imagine what the workload would've been like when the entire system is shut down for investigation!

&#x200B;

P.S. If anyone knows how long I have before the opportunity to file a lawsuit closes, PLEASE feel free to let me know. I would love nothing more than to be compensated for all of this absolute nonsense.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Oh, forgot to add - my fingers still rarely spasm to this day (three months after leaving the job), and it is still mildly painful when it happens. ",2018-10-08 09:56:17

Just got off the phone with a frustrated lady calling about her son's account.

The kid gets his tuition paid by a native corporation, and the way they work is that they pay out after all other financial aid is applied.  The kid was proactive about seeking out a ton of scholarships, and that's great.  Thing is, they told the native corp that they were done getting additional aid, so the corp paid out, but the kid didn't stop seeking more scholarships.

He thinks that extra money is going to come directly to him, so he plans to use it to buy new tires for his car (they tell me this over the phone).  So, they're confused and frustrated that they weren't able to get that money.  What happened to that refund they were supposed to get?

Well, what happened is that we saw what he did and refunded the difference of the new scholarships he sought back to the native corporation.

Mom: ""I'm just confused because it's all so random, one semester he gets that money and now he doesn't???""

Oh, I'm so sorry you got caught trying to defraud several charities, lol.  Of course you don't get that money.  I'd also like to know how long they've been getting away with doing it this way before we caught them.  How many thousands of dollars have they misappropriated in this way?",2018-09-27 01:45:39

For the past 2 weeks our shipments of stock coming from the packing centre have been late. Late as in we walk in and there is no stock to process and we end up sitting on our asses for about an hour and half waiting for lorries to arrive, that sort of late. Due to this the first half of our shift will be pleasant and calming, then when the stock does finally arrive, the warehouse descends into chaos as we attempt to get 10 thousand plus parcels processed, so we can then prep routes for the delivery drivers in the morning. Aaaannnddd because the trailers are late, which delayed us, we can only start the staging process 1 hour before end of shift. When we should be letting the drivers in 2 1/2 hours before shift end, meaning people get badgered into doing overtime.

Of course upper management decided enough was enough and lit a fire under our packing centre's ass. Oh wait. The fuckers didn't, instead they came up with THE BRILLIANT IDEA TM!

The brilliant idea??? Instead of having us cram it all into an 8 hour shift. We get to cram it into a 10 hour shift! With shift starting an hour later at 1 AM.

Smelly Lunches are the Worst,76,9edddo,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/9edddo/smelly_lunches_are_the_worst/,3,1536503603.0,"I work in a pretty standard office environment doing IT work for lawyers and their support staff. This is a story I typed out in a comment and thought might warrant its own post.  The tale is one of stinky lunches and resolutions. 


My office kitchen had an unlabeled light switch when I was hired. Or rather, it had a label, but the label must've been made a decade previous because it was just blank yellowed paper.

About 6 months into my employ, we had a serial fish nuker and toast burner. Every day for about a month the room smelled like stinky fish and burnt toast. Now we have an active lunch room scene, with people taking time to get away from screens and chat with others to relax. It is actually incredibly pleasant and positive. People were not thrilled about the smelly situation.  There were passive-aggressive notices pasted on every microwave and wall surface possible.  Tension was building daily. 

Normally I would ignore this entirely, however my suite of offices is directly across from the kitchen. Our receptionist was going through air freshener at an alarming rate, and the fish smell was drifting back into our lab far too often. So being a troubleshooter at heart I head into the kitchen and look for solutions. One jumped out immediately - the fan in the ceiling. I'd never noticed it, and it wasn't on. I guess we all figured it as some relic of a bygone era. So I flipped the mystery switch.

I cannot accurately express how loud and powerful this thing was. It sounded like a leaf blower right next to my ear, created a breeze, and inside a quiet (near library sound levels) office filled with busy concentrating people the sudden noise was enough to make me jump a foot. Concerned staff in neighboring offices rushed in to find me grinning and writing ""exhaust fan"" on the blank label.

The next day I padded into the kitchen while our fish nuker was heating his food. Made some smalltalk as he nervously kept glancing at the microwave. When he turned his back to grab his lunch, I turned the fan on. He jumped and spilled a few bits of green on the floor. Over the din, I asked very nicely if he could please turn the fan on next time he was heating up lunch.

He never brought fish in for lunch again, and now the fan is used on rare occasion when people forget about their food in the toaster oven or burn popcorn.

Tl, dr: Guy kept nuking fish, someone else kept burning toast, people were grumpy. I got annoyed and found a very loud fan, and used it to startle the fish nuker. No more fishy lunch room. The toast burner remains at large to this day... ",2018-09-09 17:33:23

So they're walking around the fields and see a cow that's calving. Cool, so they kinda watch for a minute before going back to it. This donkey decides he likes my husband and starts rubbing up against his legs. Husband sort of pushes it away, not really knowing what to do.

This transition happened about a year ago. So we have slowly been getting more frustrated because I cant get all my work done with my coworker cant really help, and my manager who did printing gave up on printing and doesnt touch it anymore. 

I was working today and my coworker comes in for about 5 minutes. I was with a customer, and I had no interactions with my coworker at this time. Me and my customer hear her say ""Im done with this place"" and walked out. We didnt know what happened. For a little while we thought maybe she was aggravated with her kids daycare. We now assume its work related. 
When my manager came in, we told him what had happen and his response was "" She must be dealing with something"". He didn't try to contact her at all to see what happen.

A few years ago, my county had a huge snow storm (2 1/2ft), so my friends, brother, and I decided to go around shoveling snow. An older woman called to us from her porch to ask us to shovel. She promised each of us $20. We were eager to accept, because $20 is a good amount for a bunch of preteens. It took the 4 of us 7 HOURS to finish the job. Being in the cold that long really took a toll on us, and by the end of the day, we just wanted our money. She gave the excuse that she'd give it to us tomorrow, and drove away from her cleared driveway. The next day, I go alone to gather the money, which I volunteered to walk the 2 blocks in the freezing winter, being the oldest. I get the exact same excuse that she doesn't have it. I come back the NEXT day, and SHE DENIES THAT WE EVEN SHOVELED HER DRIVEWAY! I then point out the pile of snow in her yard, and the marks from the shovel, which only confuses her more. And the funniest part about it, is, for the last amount of years, she still asks us to shovel for money. ",2018-08-21 11:45:40

Hypocritical Manager,38,977iqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/977iqz/hypocritical_manager/,4,1534245864.0,"So I usually work closing shifts at my fast food job. I’m responsible for taking out all the garbage in the lobby, sweeping the floors, wiping lobby tables down, mopping the bathroom and lobby floors, scrubbing the bathroom sinks and toilets/urinal, sanitizing the soda machine nozzles, and stocking up on anything that’s running low. All of this usually takes me a little over an hour to do (like less than 75 mins). Well, one of my managers got pissed at me because it took me a little over an hour to finish everything one night and told me I need to work harder/faster since I’m also responsible for cleaning the kitchen area. This is a surprise since I was never informed about having to also clean the kitchen area. I was trained to only clean lobby/bathrooms, then do any leftover dishes that haven’t been washed yet. If I was told that the kitchen was my responsibility as well from the very first day I started, I would have been on top of everything, but no one ever told me or trained me on how to clean the kitchen. I’m a bit upset because she’s scolding me for something I was never informed about, but I get over my hurt feelings and move on to the kitchen.

A few minutes into cleaning the kitchen area, my manager came up to me and asked me to cover for her in drive thru because she’s tired and wanted to sit down for a while. This really pissed me off because she was lecturing me earlier about how important hard work is and how we can’t be lazy and slow at work. Like why do you get to be lazy? Just because you’re a manager? I feel like I’m overreacting, but I can’t help feeling bitter about her hypocrisy. I also feel like she has something against me because I ratted her out to the higher level manager for making me scoop shit out of a toilet during my first week. I feel like she picks on me so much while treating our coworkers like friends. Idk I’m just sick of working at fucking fast food. As if the entitled customers weren’t enough, I have to deal with terrible managers who have no leadership skills.

Edit: Wanted to add that my manager was gone for like 20+ mins. I know it was less than 30 mins. She came back to drive thru after 10 mins, and I assumed her little “break” was over, but she just came to get a fucking soda for herself, then left again.",2018-08-14 14:24:24
When you work with students (reposted to correct sub),23,973mwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/973mwr/when_you_work_with_students_reposted_to_correct/,4,1534205670.0," I was told this would be better place for this- repost from r/TalesFromTheCustomer 

TLDR; Entitled student demands everything for free threatened lawyers. Owner overreacted and kicks them out.

Backstory: I run a rental property that helps produce digital media for students/small biz/or whomever.

We get a pair of projects that need a location and crew to film. They are students and desperately need help.

The first project needs help acquiring a cast and crew--everything goes fine with that.

So two weeks go by and I don't hear anything from the lead producer of the second project.

However I had been communicating to a project lead (also known as our point of contact (P.O.C.) about everything we were doing and the charges for our services that applied--heavily discounted for the students. However, as time goes on, a shoot day is not reserved and logistics aren't even finalized. Apparently the Project Lead would continuously cancel meetings.

That was Wednesday of last week.

Thursday: they show up with gear that piled up and took over my rental space, causing me to cancel an event.

They drop their gear off and leave. No notice or prior approval and inform me they will be here Sunday to film. (Couldnt talk, an Uber was waiting... bullshit) I inform her this is not ideal but I will stay up with the P.O.C.

Friday: we start construction of the contracted props and spend $100 in supplies and a the rest of our weekend building. They looked good, and worked properly and we had the go ahead from the client.

Saturday: we finalize our construction get it to the studio and start setting up. That's when we get a call from our P.O.C. She had quit and is no longer part of the project.

Shitty! O well life goes on, I still work. I get an email from the Project Lead with a half-assed excuse about how our P.O.C. and her ""heart were too close to it"" and asked if we could update her on the progress.

I take the time and compile everything we talked about and the agreed upon invoice. (<$350). I inform them that they have 30 days to pay and we can do a payment plan, as well as work off the debt.

Sunday morning: I wake up to an email detailing how what I'm doing is not legal, she will be getting a lawyer and will be over to use our space regardless of what we think. Okayyy....?

Shit goes down. The owner decided to not respond and wait for them. The project lead and the entire crew shows up late and starts to take over.

Now, what happened next is not my bosses best moment so I hope all you aspiring business owners take heed.

Before we started he asked the lead to sit down while starting to explain to her that he hadn't signed the waiver yet and she can't film until they settle this.

Well, a mix of ""You don't have the right/I'm getting a layer"", yells on top of ""Get your shit and get out"" shouts deteriorated into a cluster fuck of threats, tears and the claim that our company stole/rips off/ harassed her crew and are unprofessional. The threat of a negative Yelping was responded with a cold ""No one fucking cares about what you think!"" from our owner. Too much?

20 minutes later they finally start moving gear out but not without tossing one line attempts to burn me, my partner or our employees. Fine, it's all they got.

Much credit to the Project lead's life partner. With a cool head and weapons of logic, she and I talked about the situation and came to the conclusion that it was a mix of miscommunication and inexperience from the project's leads.

I the finacial manager and my business partner (I fronted the money to build the props) decided to offer the pre- built components as a peace offering. They left and now we wait.

We will still work with students but we are adjusting our parameters.",2018-08-14 03:14:30

Its VERY slow so several staff members were allowed to leave early, which left myself and 3 other dockhands, all spread across 4 docks of 24 slips each. Being the attendant for dock 1, which is the one with the gas station, I was responsible for cleaning rental boats and our fancier client rentals. These boats consist of mainly 3Breezes bowriders and CBC-1 style pontoons. I was half down the dock cleaning a 3Breezes boat when someone calls me on the walkie and says “Hey, there’s someone looking for gas. He doesn’t look like he’s in a good mood. It may be Mr. Boatguy from slip number.” I thank them and run over to help this person out. 

I get over and his boat, a wakeboarding/tubing 3Breezes, is slamming into the dock as he didn’t do such a hot job tying to the cleat. Granted, I should’ve been there to help. Once I get there he starts screaming at me “Where were you?! I honked 4 times and pulled in 3 times before this! I’ve been waiting for 45 minutes!” I apologize and say “i’m very sorry sir. Were just spread a bit thin today. I was just down the dock a little bit. If I missed the honking and you pulling in, I’m very sorry.” And he keeps going off. “You guys used to have a camera where you could see people looking to get gas and the customers could see how the lines were! What the hell happened to that?!! You wouldve known I was waiting!” 

“Sir, I’m sorry for the wait. I’m not familiar with the specs of whether or not we have a camera. If we did have a camera, I assure you, it would be working.” I later found out the camera fell apart from age as it had been out there for years in the weather. 

“HMMMPH! Whatever. Just fill my boat so I don’t have to waste any more f**king time here.” He screams. I’m staying calm but I’m starting to shake a little bit because he’s getting more and more angry. 

I grab the nozzle and go to his gas cap. I get there and he goes “I wanted EngineTech! Not regular! Don’t they train you idiots?!”. They do train us, but unless otherwise requested we pump regular fuel because its cheaper to get the EngineTech additive and add it yourself. 

Again I apologize and get the other nozzle. I drag the hose across his back swim platform since he pulled in wonky like and he goes nuts. “Can’t you keep it off my deck?!! You’ll just mess it up!” So I calmly respond albeit still shaking, “If you’d cut the engine I’d let it go in the water but at this time your propellor is going to cut my hose and spew gas into the lake. I don’t think you want that.” 

“You’d better not spill on my finish. Gas eats boat finishes! Doug, your lazy ass service manager can just add it to the list of sh*t he needs to fix!” Still screaming at me of course. “Speaking of, where is that SOB?! He never answers my calls and never calls me back when I leave messages!” At this point this guy is about 2 feet away from me. I say seriously shaking cause he’s pretty much screaming in my face at this point, “Sir, once I finish filling you up I’ll see if he’s on site. I know there was an important delivery he had to make.” 

So I finish filling him up and start ringing him up on the terminal by the pump. It takes a while since its a REALLY old terminal. He gets off the boat, comes over and starts screaming “How f**king long does it take to ring up 120 f**cking dollars of fuel?!! You must be doing something wrong! Stop screwing around.” 

So I finish ringing him up, and, still shaking, hand him the paper to sign. He draws a line. I take it back and step a few feet down the dock to try to walkie talkie Doug. Doug’s response? “I can hear the screaming from the other end of the property. Tell Mr. BoatGuy I’m not here.” So I do and BoatGuy says “just like him to run off.” 

At this point my manager, Robert, comes over and despite trying to defuse the situation he makes it worse and then walks away. I until BoatGuy’s 3Breezes and push him off. As I do, I tell him. 

“You want to know why no one answers your calls or calls you back? It’s because you act like this. Like a stuck up, hostile, 3 year old throwing a temper tantrum when he doesn’t get his way. Do me, and all the staff a favor and p*ss off.” 

My manager says “well you probably shouldn’t have said that, but at the end of the day, even if he’s not getting our gas, he’s still docking here and paying us for that. So I guess its ok this time but the next time just walkie me and I’ll handle it.” 

I walk away cause I’m angry now. I deal with 20 min of BoatGuy’s harrassment and screaming and my manager says he’ll deal with it next time? Here’s the fun part, he was the one who told me it was BoatGuy at the gas pump. Turns out BoatGuy has a habit if being like this. 

From now on, I’m not helping BoatGuy. He can get stranded in the middle of the lake for all I care. ",2018-07-29 09:26:30
Changing Diapers Where They Should Not Be Changed,42,91p3mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/91p3mz/changing_diapers_where_they_should_not_be_changed/,27,1532497115.0,"Writing the story about the mom whose baby accidentally got poop on the floor reminded me of another diaper-related story.

I work at a children’s museum, so we have many guests who come in with children young enough to be in diapers. The majority of these parents/caregivers change their baby’s diaper in the restroom on the changing table, where diapers should be changed.

However some parents/caregivers do not go to the restroom to change their baby’s diaper, and instead decide to change the diaper on a table where there are literally items that children play with. Yes the caregiver lays down a blanket first so the baby’s diaper and bare bottom are not touching the surface, but I feel like that isn’t enough protection from poopy-germs. It is especially shocking considering the fact that we have a restroom on every floor.

When we see people doing this, we direct them to the restroom and tell them that they cannot change diapers on the tables like that, and we sanitize the area.

It confuses me because I feel like that is something people should know not to do.

Edit: However, I am young and don't have children, so I apologize if I am speaking out of ignorance.",2018-07-25 08:38:35
"My experience working as a intern for a Congressman in Washington, D.C.",40,91obbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/91obbm/my_experience_working_as_a_intern_for_a/,6,1532489621.0,"Hey Reddit. I know this is long, but I really think it's necessary. Most Americans don't know what it's like in Congress for those who aren't elected officials. I wanted to provide the perspective of those on the lowest rung- the intern.For the sake of anonymity, I will not state specifically which office I worked with, nor will I state my name. 


I’m a double major in political science and history, and I’ve always loved the thought of working in government. As a matter of fact, I can seriously say that I have never considered any other career path in my life. I see working for government as the highest form of public service- after all, everyone who works in a government job, from the DMV to the President of the United States, is a paid employee of the people. I hope to one day be lucky enough to be a public servant that can help those who need it the most. 


So, I was ecstatic when I learned that I got an internship in Congress. Finally, I’d be able to work in a place where I could see how people could make a difference in my country. Finally, I’d be able to see the inner workings of the so called ‘swamp’- a place where lawmakers work together to advance the interests of the American people, from Iowa to New York. Finally, I’d be able to work in Washington, D.C., the capital of what I consider to be the best country in the world. 


When I got to the office, I was surprised by how kind and personable the staffers and other interns were in my office. As a Democrat, I was worried that my political opinions would be stifled and ignored in the office. Instead, I stepped into a office that not only was politically tolerant, but also was fun to work with. My boss, the staff assistant, was a jolly guy who ensured that the interns could not only focus on different policy initiatives (be it healthcare, taxes, or social issues, etc.), but also made sure that we had ample opportunity to find ways to advance our career in Congress. My chief of staff was nothing but accommodating, and even ensured that he could get me into contact with offices that aligned more with my political affiliation. 
The first thing I learned at the internship was that politics does not matter when you work in Congress. Everyone is interested in networking to find something (be it a job, a congressman, or even just friends) that help them out in the long run. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Democrat or Republican. If you showed the initiative, that was more than enough to make your presence known among staffers and members of Congress. 


One of the reasons I came to intern in Washington, D.C. was because I secretly wanted to see what the political climate was like in the center of American politics. And what I learned was that the House of Representatives and the Senate is the calmest dumpster fire I have ever seen in my life. Since I make sure to pay attention to political news every day. And some of the news stories I have seen have legitimately terrified me. Republican lawmakers have not worked towards ensuring that the United States election process is secure, nor have the majority even considered that the FBI may be right in the fact that Russia has interfered in the elections of another sovereign state. Not to mention that Sacha Baron Cohen has done a fantastic job in uncovering the insidious intentions of politicians like James Spencer, who clearly sees those who are not like him and his brethren (i.e. white) as Americans who deserve equal rights. 


Yet no matter what, every single office I worked in or visited was full of smiling faces that worked towards fulfilling the interest of their boss. For the most part staffers and interns were much nicer to constituents who visited their office in person. Those who worked for organizations and lobbied for different interests were treated to a beverage and a snack in some offices. Every single time. Of course, I totally understand why. They’re guests of the office, and it was only right to treat them with respect. 
However, I can’t say the same for the constituents who had the heart to call their representatives in order to voice the opinions that they had the constitutional right to let their elected official know what they think. Most of the time, my office (and a lot others) would be annoyed with the fact that they were getting calls in the first place. Every single time that a constituent called in with an opinion, no matter how kind or vitriolic, me and the other interns in many different offices would simply write down their names and numbers, and that was the end of that. I can say for sure that the representative that I worked for never knew what the constituents who took the time to call their office thought of his policies or his voting record.  In the office that I worked in, congressional staffers wouldn’t even pay attention to the names that interns had written down, even if they lived in the district. Interns often joked about some of the people who called in. I found it worrisome that those who called in the most often had the most criticism levied against them, even by the interns. 


I was also fortunate enough to meet my representative as well, and he was just as kind as the staff that he hired. He wanted to know more about me as a person, more than what part of the state that I came from. Yet, as a black intern, it was still extremely hard to look past the memorabilia in his office, especially when he showed me a picture that he took with the infamous Strom Thurmond. It was hard to reconcile the nice Congressman I met with his pride over one of the most well-known segregationists in United States history, and it was even harder to feign awe at the photo. Politics don’t matter, but the way that you act around your boss, the congressman, does.


While I loved working in the city of DC, I can say without a doubt that working for Congress was one of the most disturbing experiences I have ever had. This was a chance for me to really see what the people who worked in our nation’s capital were like. What I expected was one of the most partisan areas of the country. After all, staffers of all types of political affiliations were there. What I found, on the other hand, were actual people. There were staffers that were doing their jobs to ensure that not only were the congressman’s wishes carried out, but also trying to pay off their student loans. There were Congressman that were charismatic, no matter how loathsome I found their political philosophy to be. And there were interns, just learning how to navigate their way through all of this. And through it all, I sat and watched everything go crazy while everyone went about their normal lives. 



Though our lives were anything but normal. After all, we were all working for the interests of the former host of The Apprentice. How could any of this shit be normal?

Just bothered me a bit,39,91m68b,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/91m68b/just_bothered_me_a_bit/,6,1532472029.0,"I work at a children’s museum, and every once in a while a little kid has an accident and accidentally goes potty on the museum floor. Usually the parent or sibling or babysitter is very apologetic when they tell us about it, and since little kids are little kids, it’s not a huge deal for us to clean it up, even if it is a little gross. 

I started working there this summer (although I have volunteered there during the summers for a few years), and a few weeks ago I had my first experience with a little kid having an accident. This one was a very young child who still wore diapers, and her diaper had overflowed when she pooped in it.

I happened to walk by right after it happened, so the mom made eye contact with me and said “She pooped,” with a straight face. I replied, “Oh okay, I’ll get that cleaned up.” The mom didn’t apologize or say thank you or anything to me.

As I begin to walk towards my supervisors to ask them what to do since I have never cleaned up an accident, I notice the mom is heading to the restroom, but she is having trouble managing her baby, her stroller, and another bag. 

So I say, “Would you like me to carry anything?” to which she replies by handing the bag to me without a word. I carry it to the restroom for her, and when I set it down next to her, she doesn’t say thank you or anything to me.

It didn’t bother me that the baby had gotten poop on the floor, because that’s not the baby’s fault or the mom’s fault. What bothered me is how the mom interacted with me.

But I understand. She was probably embarrassed and flustered about her baby accidentally getting poop on our floor, and that’s probably why she didn’t apologize or say please or thank you as I carried her bag for her, so I can’t really be mad at her for that. But for some reason it just really irritated me, as much as I reminded myself that she was probably just embarrassed and flustered.",2018-07-25 01:40:29
fast food jobs aren’t worth this much suffering,51,90w8qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/90w8qf/fast_food_jobs_arent_worth_this_much_suffering/,21,1532245604.0,"So I’m about 2 hours into my shift, and I’m wiping tables down in the lobby and sweeping the floor. My manager comes out of the bathroom and tells me I need to clean the bathrooms. I think all I have to do is sweep the floors for any stray toilet paper/paper towels, wipe down the sinks, and replace the bin bags if they’re full. No problem, right?

I was sorely....... *sorely*..... **wrong**...

I go into the first bathroom (the one my manager came out of), and I see a clogged toilet filled with lots of paper towels and **un-flushed chunks of a #2** hidden right under... I try to flush the toilet, but it just won’t *fucking* flush no matter how hard I push the handle. I stand there over the toilet for a few minutes trying to flush it, but the damn thing *just won’t go*. I give up and rush out to my coworkers, and they tell me I can grab a garbage bag and use a [grabber tool](https://www.janilink.com/img/p/O/Ez%20Grabber%20black%20n%20silver%2072%20view.PNG) to scoop the stuff out. I do so, but a different manager stops me and tells me the grabber is **only** used for picking up garbage from the parking lot. If I use it to clean the toilet, I’ll have to let the higher ups know why it is unsanitary and can’t be used for general purposes anymore. Another coworker says the same thing and *takes the grabber from me*. I ask my other coworkers for suggestions, and they say the only thing left to do is **use my hands** to scoop that stuff out.....

I want to refuse, but I’m still new. I don’t wanna get fired or anything so I do what I’m told..... I put on 3 pairs of gloves and bring a garbage bag into the bathroom. I scoop out the layer of paper towels and toss them in the garbage bag. I try not to think much of it, but then I got to the **actual shit**. It’s *gooey* and *partially liquefied* at this point. I slowly reached into the toilet bowl, hesitated, then quickly scooped out as much as I can. The first thing I noticed was the *pungent smell*. It hit me like a fucking truck. Who knew a layer of paper towels could hide such a stench??? I gag and tear up so bad, but I have to finish. After I regained myself, I quickly scooped out the rest of it into the garbage bag. I tie the bag up, run out of the bathroom, and toss it out all while gagging and tearing up. I immediately washed my hands multiple times with hot water and soap, but I still feel dirty...

I’m sorry this is so long and detailed, but I still can’t get over this. No matter how much I try thinking about other stuff, it’s still stuck in my mind. I hate myself for going through with it out of fear of being fired. I should have just rejected, but I desperately need a job to pay for college and bills..... God, I still feel so damn dirty. I don’t think I’ll ever feel clean ever again.",2018-07-22 10:46:44

Most things are routine *(hem pants, put unit patches & names on shirts, repair holes, etc.)*.      
I like the things that aren't routine. Usually.     
&nbsp;     
Yesterday (Friday) afternoon, 14 new police officers walk in with their TO *(training officer)*.     
I was told later by the lead sales guy that they hadn't given us a head's up, which would have been nice with a larger group - we could have had the basic things they needed pulled & ready for them.      
&nbsp;      
Partway through their visit, 3 decide that the off-the rack armor carriers their TO had ordered don't fit their body armor and so need to be altered. *(This is why most departments have their officers fitted for this important piece of safety equipment.)*    
Enter the seamstress.     
&nbsp;     
Luckily, they want a fairly easy solution - open the sides of the back & let the armor hang out. It will be hidden from view by the front panels so doesn't matter that the armor is blue & the carrier is black.     
What the customers don't understand (though the sales people sort of do) is how blippin' **long** it takes to tear apart the factory stitching without damaging the thing they're expecting to help protect their innards from bullets for a couple years!     
&nbsp;     
There was a faster, easier solution - cut it off. Make it narrower by maybe 0.5"" on each side. They wouldn't have noticed.     
Maybe I should have just started there, not said anything. Or at least brought it to them as a faster option.     
But no... I did it the right way. Put extra binding on the now-exposed raw edges so they wouldn't fray, made it look like it came from the factory that way.    
Took me the rest of the afternoon (several hours). Finished 25 minutes before we closed. Carried everything up to the sales person, who called the TO... who asked if we were open Saturday. *(No, only over the winter.)*    
&nbsp;      
The TO was apparently annoyed that I hadn't been able to do these **while they waited**!!!!!    
*(I had told the sales guy that I'd have them done by the end of the day, and this was not a 'stand around & wait on it' thing. Guess the customers didn't believe me.)*         
&nbsp;    
Wisely, the sales manager on duty had not taken me up on my suggestion of giving the new officers seam rippers so they could sit with me & take apart their own carriers, while I put them back together better.

3 missed calls and an unwritten message,56,8zo96c,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8zo96c/3_missed_calls_and_an_unwritten_message/,9,1531855732.0,"Hello TFTJ, Usually post and browse in TFTS but this doesn't quite fit there so I thought this would be a better place for this one.

I work for a small Maintenance company as the dispatch operator, taking calls from customers, scheduling our service providers and forwarding calls to AP, AR or the CEO (Whose office is in the other room)

This happened yesterday. Every so often we get a phone call from annoyingly aggressive company($AAC). They want our business and they are dying to get it. What do they do? I still don't know. They are vague in all their answers. They've been a red flag since the first call from day one. The CEO has told me before to tell them that we aren't interested. 
I pick up the phone:

$Small time Maintenance company, this is LHM, How may I help you?
$AAC rep 1: Yeah, is CEO there?

$LHM: I'm sorry but he is busy, may I ask what this is concerning?

$AAC rep 1: I'm calling about the wholesale conversion.

$LHM: What is that exactly?

$AAC rep 1: We can't tell you because you are not the owner of your company

$LHM: ok yeah, I'll take a message and have him call you when he can.

They proceed to give me their 'personal' number and contact info which I wrote none of it down. I figured this will satisfy them and I can continue on with more important work matters. The phone call ends and I poke my head into the CEO's office. 

I must have missed it but he had stepped out to go to a job site.

Not even 2 minutes later the phone rings. It's the same company and the same guy. 
$AAC rep 1: Hi, this is Rep 1, We just missed a call from this number? 

$LHM: No one from here called.

$AAC rep 1: Maybe it was the CEO returning the call from that message I gave you.

$LHM: No I don't think so, He's not in right now.
(At this point I had another call come in line 2 from the same company which I didn't take.)

$AAC rep 1: Are you sure he didn't try and call? Our caller ID shows that we just barely missed a call from this number.

$LHM: The CEO isn't even in right now and I never got a chance to tell him that you called. There is no way he just barely tried to call you unless he's incredibly psychic.
(At this point then call number 2 rings up on line 3 while line 2 is still flashing to be picked up. I ignore that one as well.)

I didn't listen much to what he was saying at this point and I was fed up so I just ended the phone call.

Phone rings again. I gotta answer it. It's my job. I pick it up with the standard greeting.

$AAC Rep 2: Hi, This is Rep 2 from AAC, Our caller ID shows that we just missed a call from this number. Is CEO Available?

This one sounded a bit timid. Never had her call before but I was done dealing with them.

$LHM: No. I just barely told Rep 1 that he is not in. We are not interested in buying anything you have to offer. We don't need your services. Please take our number off your calling list.

She barely managed to squeak out a very quiet ""ok"" before she hung up. Poor girl, She needs a new job at a less scummy company. 

I let the CEO know what happened and he said that if they call back while he's in, I'll put them through and he's going to run them through the ringer. 

TL:DR Aggressive company wouldn't stop calling. I hope they call at least once more.",2018-07-17 22:28:52
In one ear and out the other,34,8zicpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8zicpz/in_one_ear_and_out_the_other/,5,1531804217.0,"Here's a short encounter I had earlier tonight. I work at a pharmacy retailer that also provides money transfer services. At the end of each night we count each drawer down to $200 and the rest goes to the bank. Simple, right?

&nbsp;

Well, it would be, but the particular store I work at is in a low income area, meaning people are coming in often and at all hours to do money transfers.

&nbsp;

The other night a cashier rang through a money transfer, after I had already brought the cash register down to $200, which caused a lot of issues for that night and the following day.

&nbsp;

Tonight I'm a little distracted. It's been a long day and I just want to get home. I turn in one cash register, put my cashier on that one, then take the other one to the office for it's end of night treatment. Then I remember the problem I had the other night.

&nbsp;

>Me, on phone with front checkout: Hey, I just wanted to tell you, do NOT let anyone receive a money transfer now. Okay?



>Cashier: Okay!

&nbsp;

And all is well. Or, at least, it should have been. You can see where this is going.

&nbsp;

>Cashier, over intercom: Dejo to the front, please!



I call the front register, as I can't leave the money unless it's an emergency



>Me: Hey, what's up?



>Cashier: Hey, so someone just received a money transfer and I don't have enough cash in my drawer.

And with that sentence went the last shred of hope that anyone else knew how to do their jobs.

There are dozens of labs. Dozens!,32,8xvbj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8xvbj5/there_are_dozens_of_labs_dozens/,8,1531272565.0,"Hello! I wasn't certain which ""Tales of"" subreddit would best accommodate this story, but this one seemed the most relevant.

I'm a student at a STEM research-focused college my mom likes to call ""that ABC school"", and I've been working in an event planning off on campus for a few years. Our office manages several spaces on campus where people can host events, so we essentially serve as ""landlords"" through which departments and student groups reserve event space.

However, we do get a litany of calls outside of our purview. From people trying to purchase tickets to events (we only rent out the space and furniture; everything else pertaining to the event is the renter's responsibility), to people asking admissions questions (that's REALLY out of our purview), to people trying to rent space at an unaffiliated convention center 600 miles away (no clue why the call got transferred to us). I often wonder how half of these people get our number.

What I consider one of the weirdest calls of all happened just a few weeks ago. I picked up the phone whose ring I've learned to dread:

**Me**: [Event planning office], this is [Me], how can I help you?

**Caller**: Hi, I'm looking for a Professor [No Name] at the [ABC] Laboratory.

**Me**: *(slightly confused)* I'm sorry, I don't think I got that last part. What department is this professor with?

**Caller**: The [ABC] Laboratory.

There is no singular [ABC] Laboratory. For a lot of departments, there's not even a singular [ABC] [Department] Laboratory. But she had definitely said ""the [ABC] Laboratory."" I was certain, then, that I had heard her correctly the first time, but I was now more confused about what she could possibly mean.

**Me**: I'm sorry, ma'am, but there are dozens of laboratories on campus. You'll have to be more specific.

**Caller**: *(with genuine surprise and disappointment)* Oh.

**Me**: I can look them up by name. Could you spell their name for me?

**Caller**: [N-o-N-a-m-e]

**Me**: Thank you, I'll just be a moment.

I look in the public school directory. No results.

*OK, maybe they're at one of the related, off-campus labs. Sometimes those staff members don't show up.*

I check a private database that should include everyone associated with the school. Still no hits.

*OK, maybe this person used to work here but doesn't anymore. Maybe they have a LinkedIn?*

I go to my last resort, Google. Typing in '[ABC] [No Name]', I get only one relevant result: an article from my school's student newspaper. *Maybe this'll help. Perhaps they were part of some joint program with another local college or something, so they didn't have any direct [ABC] affiliation.*

As it turns out, this person came to [ABC] as part of a high school summer program in math and science... in 1999. Since then, there has been no Googleable record of this person's existence (their name is unique enough that of the few Google results I get when I type in [No Name] and [Name, No] in quotes, all but one are from reverse lookup pages for someone with a similarly-spelled name).

**Me**: I'm sorry, but there's no record of this person having ever been a professor here.

**Caller**: *(further dejected)* Oh. Thanks anyways.

As she hung up, I sat there, confused. Where did the caller come across [No Name]'s name, and what could have possibly led her to think [No Name] was a professor? Surely, someone who'd reached professorship would have their name appear in a publicly available document, right?",2018-07-11 04:29:25

I wasn't at all confident professionally, and I didn't initially like talking to people on the phone.

One day, less than a week after I'd started gaining confidence talking to people on the phone, I asked a client for his email address. He said ""BT#######."" I heard ""BV#######,"" and repeated it back. He said, ""No, I said 'T'!"" I repeated ""TV######."" 

He yelled back, ""NO! ARE YOU DEAF?! I SAID 'BT' NOT 'BV' or 'TV.'!""

I somehow managed to find the courage and serenity to calmly reply that sometimes, it's hard to distinguish similar sounding letters on the phone. He was still quite angry.

Thankfully, my coworkers told me I was right and he was a jackass, otherwise I would have thought I was not cut out for any job involving telephones.",2018-07-01 08:41:39
This is a story about how my trainer ruined everything.,20,8tno0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8tno0y/this_is_a_story_about_how_my_trainer_ruined/,4,1529900443.0,"I'm posting this on mobile. It's also long and I just took a medication that may or may not have coordination-based side effects. Woo, judgement!

A while ago, I started putting my resume up on multiple websites in the effort to find a summer job back home. I was in college and was going to be heading back in about four months, so I wasn't looking for a career. I was also enrolled in 15 credits, which meant I didn't have time to work eight hours a day once classes began again.

I got a few responses on the resume sites. I applied for a few positions and heard back from even fewer, but my first week back I managed to book myself for interviews. One of these interviews has an interesting leadup to it.

See, they're one of the companies that sends out huge nets and calls random numbers listed on these sites to book for interviews. I was called four times by these people. The first was a lady who left me a vague voicemail (""This is Unintelligible from the HR department, we sae your resume on...""), the second was a lady I scheduled an interview with, and the third and fourth try to schedule me until I tell them I have already accepted an interview offer. I learned later that they follow a script. I learned LATER that they pay people in a call center based on how many people they ""recruit"" that actually show up and get hired. They are given sheets with name/number/resume site/email. That's it!

Those are red flags one, two, and three for those counting.

I put on a professional outfit to meet ""the State Director who is only here two days"" (who is actually there all days) and drive out to the office. There are paper signs on the windows saying ""INTERVIEWS NEXT DOOR"" and ""_____ _____ INTERVIEWS 2nd FLOOR,"" which I follow dutifully. I'm broke. I need the money. I go to my interview.

I find the receptionist and take a clipboard, do paperwork, etc. etc. I wait in a room full of people. I do a quit five minute ""interview"" and then get called back with the whole gaggle of interviewees for a...group...interview? ""Welcome to ______ ______, I'm a millionaire with a fancy car, we're glad you chose us, here is an hour of company history, complete this personality alignment thing, we'll give you a call back later today and talk to you more thanks bye!""

I'm an idiot.

I'm an idiot who got a call back to come in for the final interview! I'm asked if I have my wallet to pay for the training course and fingerprints.

I'm an idiot who has less money now! How many red flags are we up to at this point?

Anyway, I am hired. I complete my training course and pass my licensing exam. I get fingerprints taken. I memorize an eight page script and am ""enrolled"" in their in house boot camp, which I was reassured was paid.

Lies!

It takes me a while to get my agent number. My trainer who was the woman who interviewed me then states that an underling of hers will train me. She's free because two people have already quit. This underling, who I will name Susan, has already had one trainee under her quit. She demanded he give a full presentation his first day instead of just observing and then told him to get a new phone, since part of the job is in a call center and his plan was minutes-based. Either way, he's gone. My turn!

My first day ""in the field"" watching Susan do presentations is uneventful. The second day is where it gets interesting. I still don't have an agent number even though my license has been approved at this point, so all the sales Susan makes go in her name! She gets over $600.00. I get nothing. She then asks me to work Sunday. She knows I have zero chance of getting paid for it. I refuse.

I contact my boss and my boss's boss, the state director who is always there, about the 600.00, and they say contact Susan about it. I do. She tells me ""I'm sorry it really sucks that they can't pay you also I can't write you a check because I don't have a bank also I already spent it lol."" Due to how we get paid, this is a lie. At that point, she didn't have it yet. I return to my boss and boss's boss and they essentially sit there and tell me they can't do anything about it and try to scare me away from pursuing it.

By this point, I'm working 12 hour days when I was told 8, attending mandatory meetings as a 1099, and getting no salary (and no commission because Susan took the sales) and no money. I'm losing money driving around and once had to drive almost two hours one way to go meet Susan as she was doing a presentation. Usually she drives, but she drives with her knees as she texts, types on her laptop, and files her paperwork in the dash and on the backseat. She spends her time straddling the lanes doing 80 mph. She also smokes in the car with me in it (I am a nonsmoker and find smoking on your guests impolite). She spends her entire drive complaining about other clients for ""being too fat"" or ""acting weird"" and doesn't do half of what she's supposed to, instead texting angrily at her ex. This job starts to smell rotten.

I make a sale on my birthday and earn about 650.00. She asks me what my bonus is because she gets paid on my bonus too. The day after that she spends complaining with me in the car and everything - great. No sales, no money. I discover I won't get my 650.00 until the next Monday. Not the immediate Monday next week, the one after. Great.

Next week I make no sales Tuesday. I make an almost sale, but they need to wait on the charges to avoid overdrafting their bank, and so they want me to come back later. This is Susan's territory. She'll come back later and get the money. I'm miffed and I tell her - I won't make a dime out of this. She tells me to calm down.

Pardon?

Wednesday she makes a huge sale netting her at least a grand and I get nothing. She sits in the corner texting angrily as I try to present and then she takes ""the difficult sales."" She and I are the top producers for the week! Yaay! She makes over two grand and I make nothing.

I tell Susan I want to quit. She offers to transfer 400.00 worth of sales (not money, sales) into my name so I can meet the weekly quota. I am not at all convinced. She calls my boss, the woman who interviewed me and whom I liked, and said boss sales-pitches me into staying, saying they can do all this stuff for me and let's talk to the state director whatever. I can't get her off the phone without saying yes, so I say yes.

I pass boot camp. I ask Susan to help me make calls, but she tells me ""I could help you, but I won't."" Keep in mind I call cold leads for her from 2 to 8:30 Tuesday and Thursday. She makes one appointment that doesn't fit with the rest of my schedule so I leave early that day only to be stood up by them and sit in a parking lot for two hours. I finish my day meeting up with my boss and I make a sale. After calculations, my paycheck for that week should be about 200. For 60-70 hours of work.

The 400 is nowhere to be seen. I walk in, grab my singular paycheck for six weeks of work, and am told that I likely won't get the other 200 some for the other sale I made if someone has to go and get more info on it. I essentially worked for free for them for five entire weeks. I barely broke even with the check I got.

I left and never looked back.

TLDR: Workplace lies about hours and refuses to pay me. Begs me to stay, promises me they'll do all these things and then immediately forget they ever offered. I quit, likely without my second paycheck, but without regretting my choice.

What a shitshow...,54,8tmyxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8tmyxx/what_a_shitshow/,22,1529893466.0,"My kid lives with me.  I'm his only parent.  He's in his mid teens, so pretty self-reliant.     

I went from running my own successful business to working a part time security gig that pays beans.  I'm too burned out to work in my field anymore.  I really thought I was just going to collapse before my last client died.  I daydreamed of having a medical crisis so that I had to be hospitalized and, preferrably, unconscious... just to get a break.  So, after he died suddenly, I took the first mindless job I could find (it's basically shipping and receiving, but they call it security).  I've been here for six months.  It's probably the easiest job I've ever had.  I talk to truckers all night long... I'm an introvert, but the truckers who come in on the midnight shift?  They are a different breed and they are usually in and out in less than ten minutes.       

However, the owner of the company I work for... I have NO idea how he's still in business.  I ran my own business for nine years.  I KNOW what it takes to run a successful business.  This is a complete and utter shitshow.  I usually work an 8 hour third shift Friday night, then a 12 hour third shift Saturday night, off Sunday night, and another 8 hour on Monday third.  This weekend, I was asked if I could cover another 12 hour on Sunday night.  I had plans to take the kids swimming, so I said I could, but I could not work the full 12 hours, instead I could work 9 hours.  I was told to tell the dayshift guy that he would need to work 15 hours instead of 12, so that there was someone here at all times.  I told him, he agreed.  Great.    

 At stupid early this morning, he doesn't show.  I give him 15 minutes, text him to see where he is.  He says he didn't know he was working today and can't come in.  !?!?!?!!!  Reach out to site supervisor... no answer.  After an hour and a half of trying, I call the owner of the company, who proceeds to tell me it is the supervisor's problem and to get ahold of them.  I explain that I have been trying for an hour and a half and getting no response.  He basically shrugs his shoulders and says it isn't his problem.  (WTF?!?!  It's YOUR company, of course it is YOUR problem!).  I'm now at nearly 14 hours of working, after having 12 hours off, and working another 8 before that... going on no sleep since 7PM Friday evening... and it is almost 8AM Sunday morning.  So, I keep trying the site supervisor, and updating the company owner every half hour.  Yes, I was being a passive aggressive bitch, but at that point, they were lucky I wasn't just being aggressive.  I was exhausted, I suffer from chronic illness which causes extensive pain, had a flare up during work the night before, and, oh, yes, was two hours late in taking my morning medications because I was STILL AT WORK.  Oh, and I had a funeral to attend for a teenage family member of my partner that day.  

Finally, at 8:30 (2.5 hours past quitting time), the owner says he's making phone calls.  Great.  I give him an hour, all while trying to reach site supervisor.  When I hear nothing, I call owner again.  He's got someone coming in to take over in 30 minutes.  GREAT!     15 minutes later, my ""replacement"" shows up.  She's SHITFACED drunk.  Like, barely able to stand.  Can't write, can't type.  I have NO idea how she managed to drive here.  She literally passed out for 20 minutes while here.  I message the owner that she is in NO condition to be here, no less work.  He says, ""Ah, she's okay.""  NO.  No, she fucking isn't!!  I stay on to finish the part of our job that requires us to DRIVE the company vehicle around tractor trailers, because there is NO WAY she can/should do this... she keeps announcing how plastered she is, how she TOLD the owner that she was too drunk to come in (at 10AM), and he told her to come in anyway.  She's announcing her drunken state to every truck driver who comes in, which is guarenteed to get back to the warehouse supervisors.  I finally get ahold of the site sup, explain whats going on and she's just half awake, and flabberghasted.  I ended up being on site, working, for 17.5 hours, because, stupid responsible me, I just couldn't leave a half conscious, plastered person in charge of tractor trailer management.  

When I finally HAD to go, it was 40 minutes after I was told the ORIGINAL coworker, who was supposed to work the day shift, was coming in in 20 minutes.  All the while, I am checking in trailers, checking out trailers, and wrangling my intoxicated co-worker, who kept trying to leave (owner said that she was expressly forbidden to leave), then telling me to leave, telling all the drivers how drunk she was, and counting how long I had to get home, shower, and change into funeral clothes, and if there was ANY chance I'd get to see my kid or... hahahahahahahaha... sleep.     

So, I passed the original coworker on the way out - yay!  Find out later that the drunk coworker immediately left, and that the original coworker could only work four hours and HAD to leave.  I'm walking into the funeral and the site sup calls me, asking if I would come in an hour earlier than I'd planned, because original coworker walked out after about four hours, leaving the site unattended, with a truck driver waiting, and that she has someone who apparently worked here before, but was fired, filling in, but he can only work until x time.     I saw my kid long enough to give him his new keyboard for his computer that my partner gave him (woot!) and give him a breakfast sandwich, hopped in the shower, got dressed, and left for the funeral.  Got back from funeral, undressed, passed out for two hours, and guess who is back at work?     

TL;DR: work is a shitshow with no-show replacements, drunk replacements, an owner who clearly DGF, I'm running on 5 hours of sleep for the past 53 hours, having worked 28 of those hours because I'm stupid responsible, and I've seen my kid for a total of about five minutes.",2018-06-25 05:24:26

My First Job Was a Bust,42,8syk2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8syk2m/my_first_job_was_a_bust/,8,1529642188.0,"This is a whole novel of feelings and problems I had with the company, so there's a little warning.

I worked in a large, large warehouse that shipped product for a bunch of home repair stores based in the midwest. It was my first job, I liked the store well enough, and I needed money so I figured ""Hey, why not work at the distribution center for the store?"" A friend had recommended me for it and I went in about a day after submitting my application. I was eager to work and learn, and I always called my bosses ""ma'am"" or ""sir"" no matter what.

The start was fine. There were no red flags right away and things felt good, I felt productive. The pay was $10.25 an hour so I felt good about that as my first job. When things started raising questions was when I, an underage part-timer working 40 hours a week and every other weekend, was told I had to cut my breaks short. We had two ten-minute paid breaks and a half-hour unpaid lunch, and most of the floor managers told people not to take most of them. That really struck me as odd.

The next problem came up on the day I was supposed to be getting my general training. Everyone there needed to be trained on all equipment and how to run conveyor lines. That day, I got told by a floor manager (I had never met before) to start cleaning the warehouse and gave me really vague instructions. I had no protective gear, no dust masks, and no hearing protection. The warehouse was filthy from top to bottom. There was animal feces, exposed chemicals from broken product, black dust and dirt, and nails hidden in broken pallets. I had to clean it all up for about three months before I got my first training week. I developed allergies from all of it and it was so bad, my snot was black and grimy and I couldn't breathe well in the warehouse.

My training was done by an intern who was there for all of a month, and he barely knew how to run anything at all. I was pushed onto equipment that was ill-explained and handed paper after paper for things I was never tested on or even fully trained on. This happened in the span of a morning, there was no follow-up, and I was sent back to cleaning.

Now, I was originally hired as a part of the line crew. I would put boxes of product onto a conveyor, and I had to keep it stocked so the sorters could process it fast enough. We had two to three people on two conveyor lines, and each line had three docks full of product that could be anywhere from 20 to 80 pounds. The lines had a productivity goal of 500 an hour and it never changed, even though we were so short-manned. I kept up and handled the line, I learned the computer work by hand on my own, and even bumped up productivity to 800 boxes an hour for both lines.

Again, after about a month of solid work for what I was hired for, I got shoved into janitorial service. I had to scrub the floors of the break room, upstairs and downstairs. I had both gender bathrooms I had to clean, alone, and I had intense exposure to all sorts of bleaches and corrosive cleaners with no training on handling them. I felt totally disrespected at my job at this point and I had no way out. I was expected to handle both the janitor service and my job on the warehouse floor, but I was pushed into sweeping and cleaning after an hour of my hired job. I was cleaning literal human shit and piss every day of the week, chemical burns from what I was using, respiratory problems from 17 to 18 from all the black dust, and I had no pay increase or recommendation.

I could never find a manager or a floor supervisor until they wanted something, and then they disappeared. Any questions or problems I had, they were gone. Now, I had two managers (Tipper and Topper, I guess) that worked in corporate, Magenta and Bob as floor supervisors, and a whole HR staff that was either behind locked doors or unreachable. It was a game of never-ending telephone with all four of the people I answered to. Tipper and Topper were never available in the office and I only ever (rarely) saw them when they clocked out. I could raise as many concerns or ideas and I never got anything back. Magenta seemed to hate me, and she always pushed for me to sweep or mop or clean and was the one pulling me out of my job and into the bathrooms to clean toilets. Bob was brand new, had no idea what he was doing, and did whatever Magenta said.

I received one instruction for a whole day, and it was to sweep aisles or scrape stickers. I got finished with a task early every day in the hopes of going back to my job, and I was either tossed around departments all day or just given vague ""clean aisle 2 through 9"" from whichever person I could track down. They would sometimes just walk around trying to find something for me to do, but God forbid I do what I was hired for.

It finally got too much when I started getting sick. It could have been from work, from stress, from home, who knows. But I had to take a few days off (this was the only few weeks in my whole career there that I took a day off) because I was so ill. I had no PTO, no vacation, no overtime, no healthcare, and no benefits because I was just a part timer. I didn't have the option to go to full time because I was supposed to ask within the first month of being hired, which I didn't know.

I worked the full time hours and only had lunch or a 10-minute break every few days, I did exceptional work, and I wasn't recognized for it. I saw people who had been reprimanded for poor productivity, bad behavior, late marks, and disrespectful people getting raises and promotions and Employee of the Month. It was a real slap in the face when a guy, who had pressured me into giving him my number and harassed me both in and out of work, get a 40% raise and a promotion. Here I was, reporting harassment, breaking my back for my job, and doing exactly what was told of me, getting passed over and looked over left and right. It got to me that I was putting in 110% and this disrespectful guy got rewarded for his actions.

I quit one morning out of the blue and I had to take a few months to get out of the depression that job put me in.",2018-06-22 07:36:28

Cell phone repair: A franchise that turned out to be basically slavery.,52,8s37q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8s37q0/cell_phone_repair_a_franchise_that_turned_out_to/,8,1529357077.0,"Wasn't sure where else to post this, but seeing as it's been close to a year since I quit, I figured now might be a good time to vent it all out in full.

I used to work at a cell phone repair franchise that has many stores across the country. In our specific city, there's three locations. When I worked there, we mainly did cell phone screen replacements and laptop/pc repair, but I think at this point they've refocused to just cell phones.

Working there was not the most hellish experience of my life, but for a company that did have multiple locations and considered itself a successful franchise, the conditions could have been much, much better.

**Let's start with Pay! Pay is a fun subject!**

Being a regular tech, I made about $11.50 an hour. That was pretty much the standard for all techs. If you were considered a ""higher level"" tech, or if you'd been shown to specialize in something (such as soldering, software flashes, ect), you maybe got like a dollar extra.

If you were a manager, you made around $12 an hour. No extras if you were a manager who happened to also specialize in something.

Back around December of 2016, we were told we were getting raises around the time of the next staff meeting. Awesome. As it turned out....they weren't really raises. They were bonuses based off of how well each individual store did that pay period. So for example, if you worked at Store A, you'd get a little bump in pay if Store A managed to make top sales out of our three locations. If you were in Store B or C and didn't make top sales, you got nada. 

**How about benefits and tools?**

Benefits, you ask? There *were* no benefits. Benefits are for poor people. /s

No sick days, No paid time off. No vacation. No health insurance. Nothing, nada, zilch. The best you got was a tiny, tiny discount on a phone repair or purchase.

Now, what you might be thinking is that, ""hey, most retail jobs don't have fancy benefits"". Yeah, well, most fancy retail jobs at least have *something* in the way of employee protection or sick days.

We couldn't really call in sick, and if we did, it had to be *bad*. This was how a pretty bad virus got passed around for several weeks one winter. In a job where there's a lot of stuff being worked on close to our faces, where we're touching a lot of stuff, and where stuff is being exchanged between hands, we still had to come to work.

Oh, and there was no workers comp - if there was, they never honored it. Please keep in mind that we repair electronics. There are *lots* of opportunities for things to go wrong and for people to get hurt.

For example, my manager Kevin actually had a phone screen explode in his face one afternoon. This resulted in several shards of fine glass in his face and eyes (doctor confirmed). He was never given any kind of worker's comp, nor was he given any leeway for being out of work for several days because *he couldn't fucking see* out of one eye. 

He eventually had to come in, wearing his eye patch, because he needed the money. What he ended up doing was ordering a bunch of safety goggles for the team, out of his own pocket, because the company wouldn't fund them nor would they reimburse him.

They also were very dismissive towards another guy who had to take some days off repeatedly throughout the year for kidney stones. Bad ones. No compensation or anything for that, either, or even any recognition for him coming in on those days when he was clearly in pain.

**They wouldn't even give us the basics.**

Basics being toilet paper, first aid supplies, ect. Before we actually got a guy who'd come around and actually buy shit for the store like receipt paper, printer paper, and toilet paper, all of that stuff had to come out of our own pocket. And they'd even cheap out on the toilet paper - for the longest time, they kept bringing in this sickly-smelling lavender-smelling crap that went fast because it was basically over-scented tissue paper. I don't think they actually changed brands until the smell was quite literally starting to make people sick to their stomachs.

First aid was also one of those things that had to come out of our pockets. Once again, this is a job where handling glass, sharp objects, and hot objects was 99% of the work. If you cut your finger and there wasn't anybody partnered up with you to watch the store while you went to the Dollar General next door, you wrapped a paper towel around it and dealt with it. I think we used up what was in it at some point, but it never got restocked. 

As far as lunch breaks went, we never really got those, either. You got your food, you brought it back to the store, and then you basically just prayed for a quiet moment to sit down and eat. I've had to stop eating halfway through a meal several times to deal with customers. On busy days, you were lucky if you got to finish at all.

**We know we're a repair shop, but SELL, SELL, SELL.**

Part of the reason I left was because they started to really push a business model of ""sell first"". What we'd usually do is try to be fair with the customer - if they dropped their phone in a pond and it wasn't turning on, we'd be realistic with them about the chances of us being able to fix it. Once they started pushing the SELL AT ALL COSTS model, we *had* to take in water damaged phones. And convince the customer by any means necessary to leave it with us for the upfront diagnostic fee + water treatment charge of $60. 

Since we also sold cases and screen protectors and other accessories, we had to upsell those, too. I was never good at being a saleperson - I always felt like I was too much of a thinker for the job. I couldn't convince myself to buy the product, so how was I going to convince someone else? 

And the sad part is, it became less about fixing people's shit and more like becoming a second Geek Squad. Drink the customers for every drop we could reasonably charge. 

**Sexual harassment gets you promotions!**

One day, early 2017, we hired a guy named Steve to work at Store B.

Steve's true persona was deceptive at first. He's pretty laid back with a chill sort of demeanor. Over time, we realized he had kind of a ""shock value"" sense of humor, but nothing that would raise brows. 

Now, for context purposes, out of the three stores, I was the only woman who worked there. Keep that in mind for this next bit.

Some time after I quit, I hung out for awhile with Max, another employee that was on the verge of quitting. He told me that they had hired a few new employees at Store B, some of whom were girls (18-25 or so). Within a few weeks, all of the new female employees had quit. Turns out that good ol' Steve was being less than respectful towards them and had even gotten lightly physical with them, leading them to rightfully dip out as quickly as possible. 

That's not the worst part, though.

Shortly after the company had decided to just not hire any more girls to work at Store B (yes, you're reading that correctly), they promoted Steve. Now, Store B was primarily handled by Max and Steve. Max had been there longer than any of us and had been promoted to top level tech, but had never been offered a managerial position. But guess who *did* get a manager position? And guess who STILL has that manager position?

No one knows why the higher ups favor Steve. It's not like he's any chummier with them than we were. 

Yes, we have cameras. Yes, we have eyewitnesses. But no one's done anything except to just not hire girls to work at Store B. No one who matters, that is.

**Conclusion**

This probably looks disjointed, but I felt like venting about my experiences there and how the stores in our area are poorly managed. I wish the situation with Steve could be better handled, but there's nothing to be done about it since clearly the evidence is being ignored. I'm glad I'm out of there, and definitely wouldn't go back, despite the friends and fond memories. ",2018-06-19 00:24:37

Her way or the highway, likes to lecture the other directors who have the same/if not more experience than her.

I don’t know everything, but I fucking know how to do visitations. Besides the point..

Everyone in the office has the same responsibilities, being a student though, I just clean more. Not a big deal, but when I’m the only student scheduled for the week, I spend 6 hours out of an 8 hour shift just cleaning, and the other directors are fine with it because they don’t want to do it, or they have better things to do. They pretty much take care of everything else if I’m cleaning or organizing. 
Usually if someone is the last one in the office/last one in the prep room or arrangement room, they’ll lock the doors. 

Well bitchy director was the last one in the office, and last one in the prep room the other day. By logic and what everyone else has been doing, she should have locked up those doors. We all came in today to a twenty minute rant over how we all need to make sure that the prep room and arrangement room doors are locked+ and the horror stories if someone walked into the prep room. Technically, yeah we need to make sure they’re locked.. but you can’t rant to 5 people, and think you’re somehow excluded from the same mistakes they also made. She ended it with “it’s everyone’s responsibility to make sure they’re locked every day.” Yep, everyone’s... even yours. 

She then pulled me aside to specifically tell me I’m a student and need to be doing this, and I had to tell her I was too busy going through the list of shit she gave me earlier that just *needed* to be done. ",2018-06-13 18:41:43

A co-worker decided to show me that telling me off was worth losing her job.,139,8pme2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8pme2q/a_coworker_decided_to_show_me_that_telling_me_off/,5,1528483108.0,"So the factory I work at had a large number of new people come in lately, and most of them are pretty chill.  Last night, one of them made my day go from kind of bad to fucking hilarious.

I work on quality control, making sure nothing is wrong with products coming down the line.  At the time, I was the second of two people packing spray bottles into 5 pack boxes.  Person 1 puts in 3, person 2 puts in two, and the next person checks and sends it down the taper.  The issue started where anytime I got a box I would have room for 2 and get an average of 4 bottles.  She basically took one, took a solid second to look at it, and put it in.  After a bit I mentioned that she needs to go faster, and shortly after I had to hit an emergency stop button because it got that bad.

We started again afterward and she's doing the same thing, so I tell her again that she needs to go faster.  And at that moment, cause I had the nerve, the gall, the actual thought of telling her that her lack of effort was affecting me was just too damn much and she just snaps.

I'm trying to get her to calm down, because this isn't the first time I've told someone something when they have trouble with criticism, and she just refuses to act rationale about any of it.  As I'm trying to defuse the situation, she starts verbally attacking me, with things like ""This is why nobody likes you"" which is pretty big news to me.  I eventually just ask if her job was worth this and, amazingly, she says yes.  And my thoughts went from ""How do I defuse this situation"" to ""Man.  I wish I could bring popcorn on the line."".

Now for clarification, her yelling was really damn loud.  As I was going to and from the bathroom after the incident, people were mentioning they heard it and was wondering what was happening.  And this is on the other side of the factory.

Anyways, the line supervisor came by, trying to figure out what was happening while she was busy with something else.  And shortly after, the boss came by.  He asked some questions, told her she definitely was working too slow, and everything was going fine til he asked if I asked in a derogatory way (for clarification, ""I need you to work a little faster."").  She says I kept saying she needed to speed up and he asked again, since that didn't answer the question.

So she flips her shit again and starts yelling at him.  He yells at her to get into his office, and I assumed she was probably fired at this point.  But oh no, it didn't stop there.  As he's going down, trying to keep her from making an ass of herself, she keeps yelling, tells him to fuck off, and the entire situation more or less devolves into a shouting match for half the plant to see.

The entire situation was probably the most entertainment I got out of my job.",2018-06-08 21:38:28
Funeral home tales.,59,8peohs,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8peohs/funeral_home_tales/,4,1528410862.0,"Not really super interesting tales, but parts of my job that made me say “wtf” today. 

1.) 5AM removal call to a residence. Normal procedure, except this place has stairs. Stairs are hell, but not the point of the story. We get to the residence, and as we were backing into a parking spot, another car rolls up and starts honking at us. It’s not an emergency honk, when you just hold down the horn type thing. It’s an angry honk, I swear you can tell. Now it’s 5-fucking-AM, you don’t honk a horn unless I’m about to run over a kid, and I since I wasn’t and I’m a petty fucker that early, I tell my partner to ignore the person. So they do, and the guy keeps honking, and soon starts flipping us off, and yelling at us through his car without windows rolled down. My partner gets out and decides to talk to him after we park, and the guy gets out of his car and tries squaring up on my lucky-if-shes-five-foot partner, clearly trying to intimidate her. Why? Because we stole “his” parking spot. She explains we’re a funeral home, that there is no assigned parking in this particular area, and that we *technically* have priority. It’s not like we were taking the only open spot either, just one that was closest to the residence. He wasn’t handicapped, there were spots like four spaces down. Well dude starts getting pissed, accuses us of lying in front of the grieving family, and gets aggressive- threatening harm on my partner, yelling, hitting his own car. Thankfully the cops were there, but shit went down fast, and it ended with him getting arrested. Because we took his parking spot..

2.) had a 200+ lbs woman faint *on me* today at a service due to her grieving. I’ve taken care of heavier people on removals, but not expecting it, and being behind her.. worst thing to happen to my back. When she came to, she tried reprimanding me because *her* back hurt. Like dude.. I broke your fall, how do you think I feel?

3.) a couple came in for a visitation. Went to visit with family/whatnot, and then sat in our display room. No one thought much of it, sometimes people go there to be alone, and we didn’t have arrangements so nbd. Well they sat there for an hour, finally we were all about to leave, and they approached us. Pissed because they didn’t get talked to. 
They went in through the chapel instead of the office. We have *several* large signs saying this entrance is for chapels/services only, office doors are right around the corner. And I fucking saw them talk to the grieving family. 
They didn’t know the family.. they were just being respectful. Like okay, I get that but.. why the fuck would you sit down, not talk to anyone working here (even though I greeted them and it’s very obvious I fucking work there), and expect to get helped??",2018-06-08 01:34:22

I’ve known her for ten beautiful years and she loved me. My husband and that part of his family were extremely close. The closest I’ve ever seen anyone related to their still-living-90-year-Old great grandparents. She and her husband practically raised him. (Lost the grandfather three years ago.)

I haven’t seen my guy in a week. We have a very small immediate family. He and I; and our two cats. No kids yet. Alone without anyone else nearby in a new state.

Rewind back a week ago, moments before her death. High intense job with short staff just let me have a five day weekend, including Memorial Day Monday, to host a friend at our new place from states away.
The family death occurred after I dropped her off at the airport to go back home. I have to go back to work the next day. Tuesday morning, I leave early for work as I let my husband fly alone to grieve and do his respects with his family. I hold it in all week. I don’t tell anyone. My mind is too occupied with crazy work to even grieve. I didn’t sleep much. Anytime in my waking hours, I worked. Even if it wasn’t at shop. 12AM? I’d just get on the computer and do anything I could electronically for work. One night I slept for one hour before going straight to work via computer/leaving around 4AM for shop (way out of my normal shift).

Back to yesterday. He comes home. I don’t even leave work to pick him up from the airport. I feel awful for that. I didn’t even think about it. My shift is nearing its end. I’m clocking out when I’m alerted of a problem in shop. An order of over 2,000 pieces needs assistance in one department that only has two workers as everyone else was laid off since this is our slow season. There’s a lot of steps to do to make it happen. Then boxing up the order. I’m asked to come in Saturday morning.

I say no. I finally tell my managers what happened in our family and I will not give up the time I have with my husband to do work after being away from each other and not accurately processing my own part of grieving. They excuse me as I kindly refer assistance from other people around shop.
I go home and cry for the first time in five days since hearing the news of our family.

I get a message today. The department is still short. They need to complete another thousand pieces for completion. I offer my assistance first thing Monday morning. They say that won’t do as the order needs to leave the building early Monday morning before my shift starts as it’s going over seas to Europe. Our boss is going to be upset. Crud... 
She’s asking me again to come to work this weekend.
I alert everyone on my team and let them know, in hopes they’ll go in tomorrow.

My husband has been a lot better since he came home. Much livelier. Happier. We’re joking around, having fun, being sweet. I’d hate to tell him I might have to work Sunday...

Been here a few months so I’m in the limbo where I’ve done a lot, but there’s also a handful of things the directors usually take care of- Usually dealing with families, which is fine by me. That’s where our business comes in at, and I know better than to risk business until I know more. 

Well, I get a call, and went to answer as usual when the client starts spewing out information about a family member who passed before I could even get out our company name. So I’m scrambling to find a pen+paper since I think it’s a removal call. The speaker is loud, and it sounds like they’re outside with wind, so I’m struggling to hear already. 

Suddenly they start asking about prices. Okay, that happens, so I get out a price list and all they kept telling me they wanted was cremation and a grave. So I tell them the various options we have for that, and was only met with a loud “no,” while they repeated the same thing. I just assume maybe I just can’t hear “not a cremation”, so I clarify, “this won’t be a cremation, you’d like a traditional burial?” 

I get another “no!” And they start talking about what the family member wanted, but all I’m hearing them actually say is something about a cremation and grave. So I put them on hold. It’s already been twenty minutes worth of convo before I put them on hold, and I know nothing because we literally only have two options for burial- as a body, or as cremated remains. And I was met with “no” both times. I was at least 80% sure they wanted a burial. 

Out everyone, the owner comes over, noticed I’m getting flustered and he started getting annoyed at me and starts to tell me just to transfer it over. Okay, whatever, this is a client, we can’t lose the money+they’re grieving they don’t need the stress of me not knowing what they want. So I transfer them. And the call drops. Instantly owner thinks it’s my fault and starts lecturing me. I seriously thought about leaving the industry because I couldn’t even deal with one call because his lecture was so stern. But I also was lectured last week because I always transferred them, so, I don’t know. 

Eventually they call back ten minutes later, and I transferred them. Suddenly the client was like a different person. They introduced themselves, they told the story of how the family passed, and they just wanted a price list for a traditional service, like what you see on TV. Visitation and burial. They were still loud and outside, but they talked slow, and they never mentioned anything about what they did with me. 

My anxiety was building up as the owner kept looking my way and shaking his head. Eventually the call ended, and I got questioned over why what they wanted, and what I said they wanted were different. It’s not like I have any reason to lie or make up things, so why would I? I just told him that I was only repeating what I understood, and apologized. It’s not like clients haven’t said one thing, but when talking to another director said they wanted something else.

In the end, he told me to be more direct and exact when talking to clients but literally, it’s a two way conversation. I can be as exact as I want, doesn’t matter if they’re not working with me. Though I’ve accepted people like him more because he’s a very “commanding” man, and just sounds super authoritative. Still can’t believe this one call made me think about leaving.

This story happened while I was on the way home from work. I work on appliances and drive to peoples houses. Until I get home I am pretty much on the job.

&nbsp;

I originally posted this on Facebook a few days ago. I have copied and pasted it over so that the emotional state I was in when written comes through. I am by no means looking for recognition. I felt it was a story that may have made some people... happy, or maybe feel proud that there are still good people in the world. The post has been cleaned up a little so there is no identifying info. Not 100% sure what is and isn't allowed so I'm gonna play it safe and edit anything I dont think should be in.

&nbsp;

""What's on my mind you ask, Facebook? At the moment quite a bit. Namely the fact I may have helped to save a [redacted] womans life. Adrenaline still pumping.

&nbsp;

Was coming up highway 75 south of [redacted]. Was heading home talking to my amazing wife when I came upon an overpass. Crazy lady off to the side of the road waving her arms and shouting. Almost dismissed it and then I saw the SUV. I knew I had to immediately stop. I was the third person to stop. The first was the lady the SUV tried to pass. The second was a bystander that appeared to work for the county or something. His truck had yellow revolving lights.

&nbsp;

Told [redacted] I had to go and that I was stopping to help at an accident. Got out to find the first woman on the phone with emergency services and the gentleman trying to calm the woman in the SUV down and keep her from moving. As I got on scene, what was left of the SUV started a small brush fire at the front under the engine. The gentleman grabbed a small fire extinguisher and started knocking it back down trying to put it out. Managed to get control of it before it could take off. By this time a couple other guys have shown up and are trying to keep the woman in the SUV calm. She is obviously in pain and keeps trying to move and get out. It's still pouring down rain so I hand my army jacket to one of the guys to try and help shield her from the rain. Then I go and grab a throw blanket out of the van so that they can try and partially cover her because it's fairly cold.

&nbsp;

Emergency services are on the way, the woman in the SUV has a couple guys keeping an eye on her, the lady that was there initially is shell shocked and just watching (not that there was a whole lot she could do), and the guy with the fire extinguisher is keeping an eye out for smoke and sparks.

&nbsp;

That leaves myself and another group of a few people. I carry a roadside kit that has a couple things in it useful for emergencies. I grab the orange triangle and run a ways down the road and set it on the side of the highway. Hoping that people will see it and know to slow down. Beyond that it was a waiting game for the emergency personnel. I kept an eye out and flagged them down. Relayed the brief info I knew quickly and then got the hell out of the way and let them work. As the firetruck pulled up I relayed the info about the brush fire to them. Beyond that there was very little I could do except stay out of the way.

&nbsp;

Hung around until I got my jacket back and figured I would wait until I could get the throw back also. Sheriff came over and asked if we saw what happened. Again relayed what I knew since I was on scene fairly early. He said we could head on out. I said I was waiting on my throw but then thought better of it because it was cheap and said they could just toss it. Headed back home and called my wife.

&nbsp;

I've never been one to come upon an accident like this before. The SUV was a total loss. What had happened was the woman tried to pass going way to fast and ended up hydroplaning. It might not have been so bad except when she hydroplaned, she went straight into the support beam of an underpass. The damage was unreal. There was pretty much not a passenger side to the vehicle while the drivers side looked relatively intact. She had to have been the one driving. Somehow she managed to crawl into the back which was where she was when I arrived. The back hatch was jammed and the contents of the vehicle were strewn about.

&nbsp;

I learned a couple things tonight. The first is I have got to put some sort of fire extinguisher in the van. I know you should have one anyways. Had the one guy that did have one, not had it. We would have most likely watched a woman burn to death as there wasn't really a way to stop it otherwise.

&nbsp;

The other thing I learned is I need to know what's in my emergency kit. I found a wool blanket after I got home that would have gone a long way to helping. I need to figure out a way to pack a couple packs of flares or something similar that can be more easily seen.

&nbsp;

When I left, the paramedics had loaded her into the ambulance. They did not take off immediately so I can only imagine they were getting her stabilized. I hope she makes it and I have faith she will. It's going to be a long road of recovery for her though.

&nbsp;

Tell your family you love them. Dont fight with each other. Learn to let things go. You never know when it might be you in the back of that SUV and if something like that ever does happen, let there be people who will stop and give aid. Even if it's just a blanket. Love you all""",2018-05-27 23:09:24
Am I really the jerk here? (Swear words),45,8jqmk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8jqmk6/am_i_really_the_jerk_here_swear_words/,18,1526430556.0,"I do property maintenance at two residential complexes that neighbor each other. Recently I was at one of these properties when this story occured.

So I'm sitting on the tailgate of my truck, parked on the road, blocking one lane. I do this all the time, nobody cares. I have just finished some yummy sushi for lunch and I'm sending some quick texts before I get back to work.

A resident from the neighboring property saw me on the road, and drove over to come talk to me. He parks right next to my truck, blocking the road completely. 

After some small talk, a car comes up the road and is waiting to get past. He is completely oblivious to this, and he preceeds to attempt to ask some questions about brick patios or something.

So then I guess I fucked up a little by saying ""Hey I'm sorry but I'm on my lunch break and somebody is waiting to get past you""... (Honestly, I meant to say ""My lunch break is over now""... I just blurted the wrong words)

His facial expression instantly went from carefree to utter disgust. 

He says to me: ""You know you're turning down business you fucking idiot""

Shocked, I respond: ""You can always call us""

He comes back with: ""Drop dead!!!"" -He gets in his car, slams the door, and takes off (over the speed limit.) I haven't seen him since.

I felt bad for being rude. But he never gave me a chance to apologize or correct myself. I was pretty flustered after that so I texted my boss, who was very supportive of my situation.

Crazy stuff eh?",2018-05-16 03:29:16

Chronicles of Kathy,58,8h1tpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8h1tpg/chronicles_of_kathy/,8,1525461471.0,"This may be a bit long, and at this point, not entirely sure if it is over or not yet, you see about four months ago the owners of my company hired a guy I will call Kathy (I'll explain the name shortly) to be the department head of one of our hardest to staff departments. This is one of those positions that have a limited number of people who are passionate about the field, so when you come across someone who is, you usually pounce and hand them the reigns asap.

Off the bat this guy was a problem, demanding a laptop, wanting special software, asking me what is taking me so long to get him his requests, just all around being quite an arrogant and demeaning individual. We are a business, there are rules and regulations for purchases, they need to be approved before we go about getting things rolling, here I am trying to get this guys stuff together, working directly with the CEO for approval of my purchase. This guy is on me though on a daily basis... and things start to slowly come to light, this dude has no idea what he is talking about, he perpetually is talking out his ass and tries to embellish EVERYTHING about himself with nonsense and BS. As a former salesmen the term is baffle them with BS, and this guy was an ACE at that.

When I say ACE, I mean he talked, and talked, and talked, and talked, we're talking day in and day out perpetually contradictions to reality attempting to prove his worth. He is the only person I've ever met who has taken credit for things he didn't know about, for example he was shown a very useful tool in AutoCAD, and asked for more information about it because he had never seen it before, the following day he claimed he wrote the program.

With his perpetual talking, he earned the behind the back nickname of Chatty Kathy, or Kathy for short. He would take days of time just talking, getting nothing done, having highly paid employees do completely trivial work because he was the department head. Such a god complex it was aggravating.

He began to start telling his employees to stop using the company standards because he knew better ways of using AutoCAD and other associated programs we used. These employees brought these ""changes"" to the attention of IT and CAD Management, obviously we were quite pissed, got ownership involved, had them deal with the guy after we were told not to come into these meetings. Kathy decided he needed a new tactic to get his way and told his employees to stop talking to IT and the CAD managers since we were unqualified and he knew better than us. Once again filed a grievance with management, they sat him down again, and nothing changed.

I've sat in this chair for six years, I've dealt with arrogance and ignorance before, but this guy is a different beast entirely. This is a first for me to have employees to be told not to talk to me because their boss thinks they know more than me? I've heard of these types of people, but first time I've ever had the displeasure of meeting one, tack that in with managements unwillingness to fire this guy, we end up in a long long battle dealing with incompetence and ignorance.

He had an employee clean his desk for him, he taught a green user how to do everything wrong and going against company standards, that departments file size has since grown to astronomically large sizes taking up way too much disk space on our servers, the projects are over budget and late, as well as corrupted entire projects requiring many restorations of files. He has been here for four months and zero projects went out the door despite this guy telling the CEO and vice president he can promise work in a week, got nothing done in sixteen weeks.

After a long drawn out battle, Kathy got mouthy, unorganized, and overly arrogant, he told his employees he makes six figures and doing their jobs is way below him, but he'd teach them how to do their jobs to make sure we get stuff done. Kathy would spend most of his meetings demeaning his employees and telling them how great he is (he's the best parallel parker in the world apparently, world class... his truck parallel parks itself....). After 4 months of it the employees had enough and one of them snapped, starting getting shouty and Kathy told him to go home.

Kathy doesn't have the authority to send people home, just like everything else in a business, you need approval for certain actions when you're not a stakeholder. This results in his direct supervisor, Kathy, the employee being sent home pulled into a conference room. Hour goes by the rest of the department is pulled in, its loud, there is shouting you can hear of constant ""JUST SHUT THE F*** UP"" echoing from the halls.

Then 11:30 am hits, Kathy looks at his watch, says he forgot he had to go plan a baby shower with his wife, and walks out of the conference room. This is another one of his quirks that rubbed everyone the wrong way, he would just... leave work when he wanted too, without approval, without authorization, without planning, just say he forgot something and disappear. He went into the CEO's office started talking about how he's sorry he's wasting so much time today, and how he forgot he had to leave early, how its getting a bit heated in there but they are making progress.

The employees calmed down, looked at the owner after Kathy left the room and slammed the door behind him and insulting the team, basically a back handed childs play approach to dealing with confrontation, the oldest employee in the room tell the owner he has two options. Option #1, keep Kathy employed; Option #2, everyone else is walking out that door and not coming back.

Employees should never be put in that position where they are so hateful of coming to work that they have to threaten mass exodus to get a simple fact of incompetence through the skulls of ownership. Its decided that when Kathy comes back into the office, he's fired.

Now I know at this point many of you are questioning how most of this is IT, trust me you need to hate this guy and understand him to fully appreciate this upcoming portion.

I'm instructed by the CEO that the following morning, get to the office, deactivate this guys accounts, he has in his possession a company laptop with VPN and Email access, he may be working on it and we want to get that laptop back before we terminate him. I arrive at 7:00 am, log in deactivate his AD account, deactivate his O365 account, deactivate his VPN access, 7:03 a report is generated saying all is done, wash my hands of it.

President comes over to my cube around 7:30 with laptop in hand, the guy was running late, got in around 7:15 and was told his services were no longer needed. He begged and pleaded to get his personal information off the laptop, how he knew he had his social on there and didn't want anyone else gaining access.

Rule #1 of being any job these days, your work computer isn't your computer, so don't treat it as such.

President told the guy I'd take care of it and email it to him. Turn the laptop on, login to the administration account, locate the C:\Users\%username% folder and... there are a bunch of documents, for the sake of sanity and my desire to keep us 10 steps away from overstepping any legal boundaries, I don't know what to grab and ask the CEO if I can ask Kathy over an email. He's apprehensive of it, seemed annoyed at the idea, but gave me the email address anyway and told me to wait 3 hours before emailing the guy that way he can get home and explain stuff to his wife.

Three hours goes by, I send my email clarifying what I had done to ensure some level of confidentiality and integrity, you know let him leave his mind at peace that we aren't going to do anything malicious or illegal to screw with him. I deactivated his accounts, logged in as the domain admin, copied his data to a locked drive, and was waiting for clarification on what he needed sent to him.

I'm pretty sure you guys all remember at this point, this guy knows everything, as he's made it abundantly clear that he has written programs he's never heard of, he may even be a programmer who is fluent in no coding languages, he's never been on vacation but spent a week in Ghana, and got engaged in Venice, went on a honeymoon around the world, but never been on vacation. I just want this to be burned into your minds, that this guy regurgitates nonsense on a perpetual basis hoping to cause someone to think they are the second coming or something.

I get a response to his email, as does the CEO, my response? ""I saw you logged into my private gmail account, that's a violation of my privacy."" He emails the CEO telling him that I was instructed to break the law and he'd be filing charges.

Lets step back a few steps shall we? at 7:03 I have a report generated stating I deactivated everything, ran the following powershell script to verify

get-aduser cduff | get-adreplicationattributemetadata -server dc1 -properties useraccountcontrol | select lastoriginatingchangetime

His account, as of 7:03 yesterday, is deactivated, it has not been changed since then, it has not been tweaked since then. He showed up in the office at 7:15 and I didn't receive the laptop until 7:30. How is it possible for me to log into his gmail? I'd either need his password, or use the cached data on a locked account... so... theoretically its impossible right?

I throw my email on the CEO's desk, CEO and I sit down, we type up a long email about how we were going to provide this guy with a professional courtesy and had no obligation to send him any files saved to a work computer and have decided to format the laptop due to his responses implying he wasn't interested in us actually helping him get his stuff back.

Fun to be accused of doing something that is entirely disprovable with a powershell script, and quite frankly I don't know if its done with yet, due to this guys demeanor and attitude it may be on going, and probably will be ongoing for a while. I don't like the idea of court, but would LOVE to go to court and just call this guy an idiot in an entirely legally bound setting.",2018-05-04 22:17:51
Fellow employee told the rest of the staff his devious plan to call in fake sick to go on a trip to another state and got caught by boss,67,8fdezl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8fdezl/fellow_employee_told_the_rest_of_the_staff_his/,2,1524849873.0,"So we have a field technician who has been giving us problems with insubordination towards the owner’s son who is going to take over the business came to each of us coworkers and told us of his plan to call in “sick” the next three days so he could go on a trip to visit family. He kept it from the owner’s son, and one other employee but told the rest of us about it at different times. I personally didn’t think he was really serious so I didn’t mention it to the owner’s son or the owner. Another employee came to the owner’s son and finally spilled the beans that he wasn’t sick. Once the owners came in we told them and they tracked his location via his work iPhone (which he must’ve forgotten we can do) and told him that when he got back they had to talk. 

This morning when we first suspected he wasn’t joking about it I asked another tech helper if he had mentioned it, and he looks at me before I even finished asking if he mentioned it he said “WHAT DO YOU THINK”

Today our main lift broke down but we were advised that the smaller lift would operate instead.
Only no one on the gate advised this poor young girl with a walker who climbed a spiral staircase to get to the room I was posted in.

I was horrified and amazed, so I made sure that she knew about the lift that could take her down and took her via the easy access route(three shallow steps) to another part of the upper floor.",2018-04-27 01:33:09
"Every time something goes wrong, my boss calls us ‘idiots’.",33,8e3nvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8e3nvd/every_time_something_goes_wrong_my_boss_calls_us/,13,1524408395.0,"Idiots. Chumps. Morons. Dolts. Dummies. Dopey. Etc.
Those are some of the words I’ve heard so far.
It’s every time something goes wrong with the flow of our whole operation (we do production) at work or if something has gone wrong with a customer’s order once they receive it in the mail (even if the customer doesn’t really complain).

I’m wondering if I’m being sensitive here and not bucking up to the real world as fast as I should be... he’s never directly said it towards me alone as he says ‘we as a whole look like idiots’ or generally calls a different group of working-people at our place, saying they’re being idiots when we’re talking one on one...but it’s left a sour taste in my mouth. No one likes to be called stupid. We make mistakes, sure, but we’re not stupid.
It’s just that that sort of talk + cussing would not fly at my last job and maybe I’ve been conditioned working nearly 3 years at that last place. My last boss was a hyper-sensitive PC guy (with a background).

Bonus: Boss man said I needed to handle one of my team mates who’s messed up (again). I asked him for a solution, and in ways, clarification for what we exactly wanted out of me as the man seems vague sometimes. He sternly looks at me and says to me that if I can’t proceed, then he can’t trust me.
Which to me......is a big ‘F—- You’ by him...as I am a firm believer in trusting your employees. It’s something I wanted to bring light to with my last boss for my last crew as he’d have the same issues. It’s important to hire and trust your employees. ",2018-04-22 17:46:35

How Spooky!,29,8czud3,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8czud3/how_spooky/,4,1523997480.0,"I work at a small rental company in a tourist town. We really just focus on weekly vacation rentals in the summer, but in the off-season we offer more flexible dates. Last Thursday was our first ""big"" check-in day of the year (We had twelve check-ins, so it was the most we've had so far. In summer we can have over 300 a day) and, for the most part, it went off without a hitch.

Sometime in the afternoon, an elderly woman checks in (I'd say 60's or early 70's). She's staying by herself, which is unusual for us, but not alarming. When she checked in, she was very nice and friendly. We gave her the condo keys and parking passes and sent her on her way.

A few minutes later, she comes back. She can't find the building. The building is one street over from where our office is located. However, we put on our customer service smiles and give her directions to the building. Again, she leaves and immediately comes back. She points to the building across the way from us, asking if she could stay there instead. Of course, all our properties are individually owned so you can't just switch rooms like a hotel. Our only option was to keep guiding her to the building she had reserved. Since it was slow in the office, my co-worker offered to ride with her and guide her to the building. The woman happily accepted. 

About ten minutes later, my co-worker comes back. She got the tenant to the building, but had a wild ride there. Apparently, the woman drove over a curb. But my co-worker was fine, so we chalked it up to a silly story.

Little did we know, the story was just beginning. A few minutes after my co-worker got back, the woman came breezing back into the office. I happened to be at the counter, so I asked her if everything was okay.

""I can't stay there,"" she said. ""It's too spooky."" At this, I start to get worried. Is she one of those spiritual types who won't go into a building if they ""sense something""? How do we handle this?

""What do you mean 'spooky'?"" asked another of my co-workers.

""I've been waiting for the elevator to come, but it won't come!"" the woman said. This led us to discover she hadn't realized the keys we gave her included an elevator key. We explained how to use it and she went on her way, chuckling at her little moment.

The rest of the day went on as normal and we didn't hear back from her. We assumed all was well. The next morning, however, she came storming back into the office.

""Did you have a good night?"" I asked her. 

""No, I did not,"" she replied and I braced myself for what could possibly be next. 

She had a whole list of complaints, ranging from one of the beds being sunken in, the popcorn ceiling had some peeling, and there was some white gunk around the kitchen sink faucet. 

""I can't sleep on that bed. I've been disabled for twenty years!"" she told us. Now, this is a valid concern, but it hadn't been voiced to us when she made the reservation or at any point prior. But that's not the fun part.

""I wouldn't let a trick sleep on that bed!"" she yelled. We were dumbfounded. She later declared a tamer version of that, saying, ""I wouldn't let a dog sleep there!"" She told us she simply couldn't stay there. As we had nowhere else to put her, our only option was to call the owner to see about the refund. In the meantime, the lady went to go pack her stuff.

As we readied a refund, we called our maintenance guy to the office. Obviously, before we give anyone a refund, we have to investigate the tenant's claims. It was while we were filling him in on this woman and her antics, something new came to light: the tenant claimed to our bookkeeper that she had not stayed in the unit the night before. She claimed to have gone to stay with her brother in a different building (this is relevant, I promise). She hadn't told any of the rest of us that, so we were suspicious.

I decided to go with our maintenance guy to the unit in case she was there. She was funny enough that I didn't think she'd take kindly to an unfamiliar man showing up. I thought a familiar face would help. 

Naturally, she was there when we arrived. And here's the thing: most of her claims were valid. The bed was sunken in (this woman was thin, so it had nothing to do with her) and there was some calcium buildup on the faucet (due to the salty sea air). However, she 100% stayed there that night. There was food in the fridge and the ironing board was out (along with the iron). Clearly she'd spent time here. But what could we do?

We helped the woman take her luggage to her car. On the way down, she started flexing (or straight up lying). Among her strange claims were:

""My daddy is an engineer. If he saw me sleeping in that bed, he'd lose it!""

""My room at home is as big as that whole condo. I'm not used to living like this.""

When we got to her car, she pointed out the car next to it and claimed, ""I have that care in gold!"" She then graced us with a small anecdote on how her relatives teased her for having so many cars she doesn't use them all (apparently the one she drove down in was one she'd never used before).

In the end, we had no choice but to give her the refund. And now, all we're left with is a crazy story about a crazy lady.

Almost answered a job scam. They yelled at me down the street.,99,8cr3gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8cr3gn/almost_answered_a_job_scam_they_yelled_at_me_down/,11,1523913188.0,"I was a senior in college, about to graduate in a few months. Found a job offer on a job board for an event coordinator for about 40k for big corporate functions. They didn't require any prior experience in order to apply. That should have tipped me off that something was wrong, but I was so eager to find a real job I sent in an application anyway.

Almost immediately after sending it in got a call back asking me to come in. Small office, everyone there is my age or younger. Again, should have tipped me off considering how big a deal the offer supposedly was but I was too nervous to really notice it. I'm handed a slip of paper by the receptionist and get asked to fill it in before I can interview. Standard softball questions ""where I went to school"" and ""traits I want from a job"". Wondered why they couldn't just ask me, and then the actual interview rolls around. 

First interview takes about 15 minutes tops, mostly small talk about sports of all things and nothing about the actual job. Interviewer tells me the company office is new, they're rapidly expanding and they want *amazing* people *who can *be independent* (this will be important) to come in ""and lead a team"" (more on that later) and asks me when's the quickest I can start. I give him the standard two weeks so I can let the place I'm working at know. He gets agitated and tells me that if I start I would have to start *tomorrow*. 

Oh wow. I was understandably shaken a little, never having a *real* job before now having only ever been in school, and more than a little weirded out that he's making it sound like he's ready to hire me right after we just met and we haven't even talked about the job. He must notice the look on my face because he backs off, and tells me that there will be a ""final interview"" tomorrow and if I'm one of the *chosen few* to be selected for the position I'd be invited back tomorrow, so there was still time. Again, I get a call back almost immediately after I leave that I've been chosen based on my ""excellent answers"" (""lol, what answers guy?"" I wish I'd said, but again, dumb kid). This is moving really really fast, but I'm new to the job world and I really did hate the job I had enough that I was seriously okay with just not going back there if I landed this, so I OK'd the interview.

Show up for the big day, nervous but even more excited. Going to finally have a real job with *insane pay* for someone just coming out of school while everyone I knew was struggling to get hired. I walk in... and immediately the rose-colored glasses come off. Something is very, very wrong.

I get there early, because this place is right by my house and I wanted to make the best impression. I go in, and all the televisions in the lobby are blaring three different sports games at almost max volume. I get handed yet another piece of paper with softball questions and am told to sit. I finish in five minutes and sit back down. Another gentlemen comes in. 'Another of the chosen few' I think, because this position is supposedly so important and how rigorous the screening is according to my interviewer.  We make some small talk as best we can over the televisions going off all around us. He's a really nice guy and we pass the time a little, until I ask him what he does for a living. He's a stockboy at a electronics store down the street. This unsettles me a bit, because this was supposed to be a very important job and I was a college student with honors. He's really nice, but why is this guy here?

Another kid comes in. And another, and another. Soon the lobby is practically full of guys filling out those dumb little sheets of paper. At one point one of the guys that works there has three people following him around scheduled to interview with him. I look around. Every room I can see into has at least one person getting interviewed in it. More people are walking in when I finally get called by a kid my age going around with a clipboard of names. 

*I wish I was making the rest of this up, but I *swear* to you this really happened.*

I get taken into a section of rooms I've never been before, and I get introduced to the guy who was supposedly the big boss of the company, or at least this branch of it. He's late forties at least, everyone else I've seen is late teens or early twenty somethings at most. He's nice, shakes my hand, then hands me off to some other guy. ""He's the best at what we do here"", I'm told. That's great, if only I knew what exactly *what* we were doing here. 

The boss man tells me that this guy is going to fill me in on what we do here, and then we'll see about setting a contract up for me. 

Okaaay... This is still an interview right?

I follow this guy around the corner of this nice office space... and right out the back door. It strikes me that this ""expanding major company"" is just the handful of little rooms I could see from the lobby and the boss' room. I follow this guy down the street, to a restaurant just opening up for the day. Half the booths are full with people getting interviewed too. We've got a window seat, so I can see the little corner cafe right next door has the same thing going on with at least all its outdoor seats. What is going on here?

The ""interview"" starts out standard enough, with the guy asking some standard questions like leadership experience, my major, business aspirations, etc. I mention I'd like to own my own business someday, and then he jumps all over that. Tells me how amazing I am just from my answers, and says we're alike in that everyone at this company has the *entrepreneurial spirit*. He buddies up to me for a little bit, laying on the flattery, and saying a few things about business in general I agree with. Mentions how this business allows all of us to succeed, and us leaders are all owners in this amazing business going very exciting places.

And then he says he doesn't like people who want a salary. 

He says that people who want to be salary can't be entrepreneurs and can't be leaders, because they're not independent and they're not afraid to take risks. ""*We're not like them, are we redditor?*"" he says, trying to get me to say yes. I finally ask him exactly what it is I'm doing as a ""leader"" on this team, because by now it's readily apparent this isn't the job I was applying for. He finally gets a handle on himself and stops tooting his own horn and we get down to the details. This isn't an event coordinator job. It's not even a leadership job. Well, ""not at first"". It's door to door sales work. I'll spare you what exactly it was I'd be selling, it was frankly ridiculous and didn't sound at all legitimate. I'd be driving around all day with the dozens of other people getting interviewed in the company clown car. 

Out of morbid fascination I wonder aloud where my pay would actually come from. ""Well, that's simple."" He proceeds to take *my* notepad and starts putting down a bunch of equations, basically assuming perfect sales and if everyone I know wants to buy this stuff, I'll be making serious money from commission. Now and then he asks me to answer one of the equations, and then compliments me on how well I did and that ""I'm doing amazing already"", trying to stroke my ego. The money made off sales is split among the whole group and with the company, so my pay on average would be $200 a paycheck, far less than what I was making from the crummy job I had at the time.  My head is spinning from all the info he's unloading on me, which I suspect was exactly the point. 

Now it gets really fun. Here's where I start being a *leader*: after I make enough sales, I'll move to the ""next level"" of the program and get like a half dozen people under me, then when they moved up a half dozen under each of them, and so on, and so on. In about a year after I joined ""the program"", I'd be expected to rent my own office somewhere and send these people out to do their own sales. ""Just like you wanted right? Your own business!"" he said as he waved the notepad of numbers in my face. He told me he needed to confess something to me, something he knew *I'd* understand. I was one of the final people he needed to interview to get his own office, so he was grateful I was here. You know, playing up how I was doing him a favor and how it would break his heart if he couldn't make it.

This was a MLM company at best a Pyramid Scheme at worst, and by the way this guy was getting more and more nervous the more questions I asked, I was leaning the latter.

By this point my nervousness has evaporated, and I known damn well this is not a job I want. I tell him I'm not so sure, ask some hard questions, ask him to slow down and really repeat some of those points above. At this point I'm only still here because I'm having fun interviewing and grilling *him*. He starts getting red and shifting in his seat. ""Why are you worried? *You* applied *here*. Where's your entrepreneurial spirit? Let's do the numbers again and you'll see-""

I tell him he's wrong. That I actually want to get *paid*, because I'm going to be coming out of college already with a mountain of debt, and I can't afford to not have any money. He makes a face like he understands, like he's just had a huge revelation. He tells me he gets it, he's actually a college grad too! In fact, his boss joined the company, and paid off all his college bills and more in just six months!

His middle aged boss, at this office that's only been open a couple weeks at most.

He tries to loop back around into his sales pitch, because that's what it is, it's clear that's what it is after we got ten minutes into the interview and he started selling and stopped asking about qualifications. I look him dead in the eyes, and say very firmly ""Look: *I""M DONE*"". He looks defeated, nods like he understands.

And then he says this little gem:

""Well, I'm glad you let me know how you feel. It's important we got this out now before I hired you...*because we only want people who can actually succeed here*.""

I just smile at him and shake his hand. I leave the restaurant, passing all the kids and interviewers that are looking at me like I've grown a second head. People are sitting on benches all between the office and the restaurant getting interviewed. I walk back to my car, and he walks back towards the  door back into the facade of an office. He suddenly spins around and shouts out in the earshot of all the people around us: ""COME BACK WHEN YOU WANT A *REAL* JOB AND ARE TIRED OF RETAIL!""

Sure man. I shrug and get in my car, waving at them all as I drive away.

It's been a whole day and a half since I heard about this company till I walked out of my own interview. Things happened so fast I don't remember every detail, they tried so hard to just get me to sign, don't think, just SIGN! I just knew that I needed to get out before I made a huge mistake. I checked that job board again later to make sure that guy shouting at me in the street wasn't my fault somehow. Turns out this place advertises openings for jobs from managers to accountants to party planners, all of them turn out to be the same MLM gig. Remember those TVs blaring max volume? There to keep the applicants from talking about what job they were there for or overhearing the same identical pitch. 

I check their website and the reviews they get online now and then for giggles. Half the reviews are suspiciously empty five star reviews and the rest are people complaining they were ripped off. 

None of the people I saw seem to work there anymore.",2018-04-17 00:13:08
The Stolen Interview,64,8bhtgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8bhtgh/the_stolen_interview/,4,1523459588.0,"I have been planning to write this one for a while.

I had been looking for a new job for a little while, essentially had been throwing applications around on Indeed and seeing what sticks. Eventually I received a request for an interview at a well known cross-country freight company. The position was described to me as ""driver check in"" but there was little else of note. I knew the company and had previously used them myself at my old job, so I knew they were reputable, so I had no issues with showing up to the interview.

I arrived at a freight depot and walked through a rather nice office after being greeted by not my interviewer, but by the customer service manager. We will call her Nadia. We walked towards the back to the freight office where customer service, dispatch and their managers were. It was a typical slightly dingy but large warehouse office. I didn't think of it much as I had previously worked in such places and was well versed in how warehouses are. We chatted a little on the way about what I used to do and where I had been, and that I had previously used the company before to freight our products.

I was taken to a small conference room and she went to speak with her boss (my original interviewer) and came back shortly, explaining that she wanted to interview me for a slightly different position.

Nadia explained to me that she was looking to help clean out some inefficiencies in the company and effectively was looking to have someone take her job so she could move up the ladder, and that her current team didn't want the position (red flag here). She was impressed with my previous experience and after a good hour of chatting she was very excited. Exact responsibilities were still a bit unclear but I was getting desperate to pay bills and didn't really care. I left and the next day I was called by HR to start work on Monday.

I showed up and had to be buzzed in as I did not have a passcard. I sat at the small cubicle near Nadia who started showing and training me for customer service, and that I would also be needed to help in the Driver check in position. She and her customer service team were ecstatic about how I took to the customer service work and how I was familiar with the industry as part of my previous experience.

The driver check in work was a little more complicated.

I had never dealt with in house truck drivers before, and much of that work was dealing with logs and deliveries for about 50 different drivers. It wasn't particularly difficult work but it was very different from both what I had done in the past, and what I was being trained to do in customer service. It was also very slow, as drivers only started checking in after 4 o'clock and there was not much else to do the rest of the day in that position as there were already two other people working in this department. We will call them Jessica and Johnny. This is where the next red flag comes in. 

Jessica was an older woman who had been in the business for 40 years and getting close to retirement. Nice lady but a poor teacher. She did things and knew how to do them because she had always did them. There was little documentation that explained why and she said little else aside ""that's how it's done"".

Johnny was quite the opposite. He was a 19 year old kid who walked in often an hour late or didn't show up at all. When he did he did his work but was otherwise very lazy and he regularly smelled like he didn't shower for days. The red flag came when, on the Friday before I started a post went out from HR that I was starting on Monday in the Driver check in position. Apparently he threw up his arms saying ""that's my job what the fuck"", went to Nadia and asked if his job was safe, which she affirmative said yes his job is safe.

Two days after I arrived Nadia's boss went on holiday for 2 weeks. During this time there were two massive snowstorms that crippled us in delivery times and customer service had to pick up the slack in dealing with angry customers. I was now sitting full time in customer service but most of my duties were related to calling out to customers to I formatted them of delays. I had little to no autonomous tasks and two weeks in, felt lost as I was partially trained on two separate jobs and didn't have a handle on either. Another red flag, in hindsight.

The third week comes by, my bosses boss is back and while I went to lunch, when of our dispatchers is taken by ambulance for a suspected heart attack, (he was fine and came back to work a few days later).

Nadia went to take his position and then informed me, angrily, that I needed to go to driver check in and learn to do the job there as soon as possible because Johnny no showed again, and her boss was pissed I didn't know how to do my job. For the next two days I was in purgatory back there again, spending more time on my phone than actually working for lack of work, while customer service suffered from manpower shortages. 

By Thursday I was miserable. I was coasting by with the job but now felt like I was being wasted, wasn't being taught how to do the work and was just generally bored.

I went to Nadia and we went to the cramped conference room to discuss the issues. I expressed my problems to her and she stopped me, saying I was never doing customer service, that I was always driver check in. I inquired why I was being trained with such a heavy bias towards customer service and she told me I needed to learn how to do things in the company. I felt very confused and lied to at this point. I had the impression she had dragooned me into her department that without informing her superior and when he came back from vacation and found out, he was pissed.

When I informed her that I felt there was not enough work for 2 people km the department, much less 3 she said she knew. I asked to clarify the issue and brought up the conversation  with Johnny, where she said his job is safe. This is where the worst flag came from.

""OH his JOB is safe, his position is not."" I felt very uncomfortable at this point. Regardless of whether she was right and he needed to be removed (which I did agree with) she had lied to his face when he asked if he was OK.

It got worse in the next few minutes as she continued, discussing her frustrations with her department, and how she had 3 more frustrations in dispatch, two in the back, 2 more in another department. It came to a head when she said to me very slowly ""I don't want YOU to become a frustration.""

It was then I decided to leave. I no longer felt comfortable or safe as a new employee in the office when I had seen how my boss talks about her employees to others in private and outright lies to them. I smiled at her and said I understood and that everything would be OK.

I walked out of the room with her, right to my desk, got my things and out the front door. As soon as I got home I resigned by email and sent a more detailed email to HR explaining the issues and did not go back.

It worked out in the end, obviously I was not asked to return to work but the very next Monday I was lucky enough to get an interview with a new company, have been here a while now, getting paid better, closer to home and am actually enjoying going to work in the morning. ",2018-04-11 18:13:08
"Boss Amnesia Syndrome-- tired of saying, remember when we talked about this?",45,8b8exy,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8b8exy/boss_amnesia_syndrome_tired_of_saying_remember/,4,1523373987.0,"I don't know how some of the people who have been fortunate enough to be my boss can get through life with the memory problems I've encountered. Also, why can't people just write stuff down? I've had bosses and co-workers praise me for remembering things, but I just use the ancient technology of writing stuff down. That's my secret to remembering stuff.

Two stories:
I am currently a contractor. I have a long contract and devote 30 hours/week to that job. Recently, I learned of another job, so I talked with current boss about cutting my hours down to 10/week so I can take this other job. He said he wanted me to have two weeks to wind down and give us time to discuss shifting project priorities. I know he had a minor panic attack and I knew to just wait it out because this is the best time for me to take a step back-- nothing there is urgent, things won't pick up until August at the earliest. 

I send him an invoice for this month, prorated the hours to reflect that I would work 2 weeks at 30 hrs and 2 weeks at 10 hours. He emails me back, ""Why is the invoice so much? I thought it would be a 1/3 of the normal amount?"" So I write back, remember when you wanted me to continue working for 2 weeks? (Spoiler: he doesn't. His panic attack passed quickly and he forgot all about it.)

This reminds me of a previous experience at another job. We (myself, my Supervisor, and another Colleague) had a weekly meeting with The Boss. Right before the weekly meeting, Supervisor, Colleague, and I were given a new approval process for using the office debit card, because apparently there were some issues of not having enough money in the back. Seems pretty important! 

So we get the new process, meaning it will take a week to get purchases approved. Fine, no big deal. In the weekly meeting, The Boss wants some data that costs money-- it's a long process to get that data and he's getting impatient. I finally have all the paperwork complete and was planning to request the funds using our new process. The Boss wants the data ASAP and asks if we can get it by the end of the week. Supervisor and Colleague say yes (because they're not in the habit of telling The Boss no).

I say, ""No."" 

The Boss looks at Supervisor. Then he looks at me. He asks again, ""Can we get the data by the end of the week?""

I say, ""Not if we want to follow the new purchase process we just talked about with the accountant.""

There's a pause. I'm clueless. I didn't realize that my saying No to the The Boss had made everyone else uncomfortable until I thought about it much, much later. I thought The Boss would want to make sure we didn't overdraw the bank account-- since that's what the accountant HAD JUST TOLD ME.

The Boss laughs. ""That's what I need! Someone to tell me what's going on!""

I remember asking, ""Do you want us to ignore the new purchase process to get the data faster?""

He said no. We waited an extra week.",2018-04-10 18:26:27
Coworker tells me I've gained some weight,30,89s1gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/89s1gw/coworker_tells_me_ive_gained_some_weight/,8,1522865949.0,"I have one coworker that I'm sure exists in many offices: she's been here forever and does a lot of good work so the powers that be basically let her have the run of the place. I'll call her Chris. I actually like her (I think?) and believe she's a good person, but man. She's SUPER opinionated and discusses highly politicized issues regularly and loudly. She also enjoys listening to political podcasts in her office. Again, loudly. She has opinions about everything else as well and isn't afraid to let people know them. If you're in her vicinity she thinks it's her right to know exactly what you're doing and why. I sit at the front desk and she often stands directly behind me so she can observe not only the lobby but also my computer and discuss what I'm doing on it. 

She's very proud of her keto diet and works out religiously. Of course this gives her the right to tell everyone else what they should be eating and more than once I've heard her tell other coworkers that their food has too many carbs in it. 

The creme de la creme is that today I wore jeans with a belt and my shirt tucked in. I'm tall and thin but lately I've gained 5 or 10 pounds. 

I went to the bathroom and when I came back THIS WOMAN was standing beside my desk eating a plate of chicken. She looks at me while she's chewing away and booms ""YOU GAINED SOME WEIGHT LATELY??"" Me: ""um maybe a couple pounds."" ""WELL I CAN TELL!""

I go behind her back to sit down and give my coworker a WTF??! look. My coworker looks really uncomfortable and is just like ""Chrissss!"" Chris barks back ""what? She (I) know I aint got know filter! If she gets offended that makes her a snowflake!"" We definitely know which side of the political spectrum she sits on it. 

I know she's an asshole and people are going to tell me I should have called her out/reported her, but I really don't feel like it. If I heard her say that to someone else I like to think I'd speak up, but it's just not enough of a big deal to me to upset my calm Wednesday over. 

Now I can tell that she feels bad, but she can't make herself apologize so she's just loitering in the lobby making small talk with me.

"Moved my desk, co-worker lost her shit",112,89q8j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/89q8j2/moved_my_desk_coworker_lost_her_shit/,19,1522854230.0,"I work for a company we'll call ABC Corp.  At ABC Corp, there are several offices and then units of people in each office - one unit per supervisor.  My office recently moved buildings and we were seated in our cube farm according to unit, so you sat with your other unit-mates and right outside your supervisor's office.  Fine and dandy.

One of my co-workers (heretofore known as X) is notorious for being insanely rude and inappropriate.  She's had the job almost 10 years and has had 10 years of HR meetings regarding her behavior.  Past offenses off the top of my head - *loudly* talking about her sex life in the office, receiving personal, rage-filled handwritten letters from her boyfriend's wife at the office, masturbating on the floor of the family bathroom (wish I was joking), announcing her farts to people around her, bringing in a string her cat ate and pooped out and showing it off to everyone (as you do).  ABC Corp employees are unionized and it's the kind of union that protects even the bad employees.  Hence, X is still employed.

Naturally, when we moved, I was put next to X.  I knew it'd be a clusterfuck but wanted to stick it out so as not to seem difficult by immediately asking that I move my desk.  Yesterday, the straw met the camel when she farted and said, ""that was a squeaky one!"" to no one in particular.  I could not live my life in this idiot's fart cloud anymore.  So I emailed my boss asking to move seats, said the loud/busy corner I'm at was increasing my migraines (true, though not the primary reason for my request), and quickly got approval.  No big deal.

This morning, X fires off an email to our supervisor, CC:ing everyone in our unit.  *What determines if we can move or not?  Why did she get to move?*  I cringe and shortly thereafter my supervisor stops by my desk and says we're having an ""impromptu meeting"".  Here we go, get the popcorn.

Boss: I know you guys have some questions about moving desks, what are they?

X: What's a real reason for moving desks?

Boss: It's a case by case thing, but you're welcome to request via email or in person and we'll discuss and get back to you.

X: But what's a reason for moving??!

Boss: Did you want to move desks, X?  If so, feel free to ask and we'll let you know.

X: Well, if I get a ""No"", that's unfair.  Like you didn't consider it.

Boss:  Oh, we'll definitely consider it, don't worry.  But not all requests will be granted.  Like I said, it's case by case.

Since it's obvious this meeting is about me, and I don't want X to start screaming at me thinking I complained about her to our boss, I pipe up.  ""I just wanted to let everyone know - I moved because the foot traffic and noise at the corner there was making my migraines a bit worse. I just asked, and got a yes.  That's the only reason.""

X then turns around to face me and says, ""We all get headaches, and we deal.  WE ALL GET HEADACHES."" and turns back around.

I make wide eyes and look at my boss, who shakes her head ""no"" as if to say, ""please don't reply.""  I'm mortified so I don't say another word.  I let X dig her own grave.  Boss looks at her totally confused and a little horrified.

Boss then asks, ""X, are you concerned about someone else moving or about yourself?""  X is like, ""Oh, I don't want to move.""  Boss: ""Okay, well, then it's no one's business but the person who moved.  You might not like that answer but that's how it goes.  Any other questions?""  There's...no other questions.  Just awkward discomfort hanging in the air like pea soup fog.

So we all file out of the room and head back to the office.  

Why do I have to work with this idiot?!?!  Why are people like this?  Why am I trapped in a dumb version of Office Space?  I feel like an idiot for speaking up at all, but I just wanted to quell the rage of the nutbag.  I need a vacation.  ",2018-04-04 18:03:50

This was my first real job out of college. I was a paralegal being paid $12/hr, well under the market rate (I was billed out at $125). I had recently been diagnosed with anxiety disorders. The owner of the firm was not making that any easier. She told me she would rather I come into work late and fully rested than on time and groggy. About a week later, I texted to say I was really tired that morning and would be between half-an-hour and an hour late.

Later that morning, when the owner got in, she ripped into me for coming in late for being tired. After she left, my coworker who sat in the same area told me that she clearly remembered the owner telling me I should come in late if I was too tired. I was also confused because another employee had fibromyalgia and was allowed to come in late or stay home if her symptoms or medication side effects were bad. (Before anyone asks, we were too small for ADA and EEOC protections).

However, that was not the last straw. One day, the owner decided she wanted a conference table moved from one room to another. No big deal. The table was big and heavy, so it took five people to move. The next day, she noticed the table had been moved and asked why. The five of us said she had asked us to do so the day before.

No, you dumb bint. There’s no way to shorten it. This is a niche field, with programs no one has heard of outside the industry, used in a way no one outside the department would know. It can’t be shortened. 

First of all, this is the first time you’ve ever looked at the training manual for your department? It’s been completed for TWO FUCKING YEARS. The time for giving me feedback on the thing ended TWO YEARS AGO. But this explains a lot. Like why you were useless when reporting we had hired a dud. Why you kept making excuses that they were neeeeeeeeeew. 

Second of all, my manual is emphatically NOT why we have high turnover. Fuck you. My manual lowered turnover, shortened drastically training time, decreased errors, and got you a more knowledgeable workforce. Turnover is still higher than goal because the pay is shit, and you’re an unprofessional, tantrum-prone, favorites-playing, petty-ass BITCH.

"I thought I was just getting my tupperware stolen, but is someone actually messing with me?",31,84neyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/84neyk/i_thought_i_was_just_getting_my_tupperware_stolen/,16,1521128579.0,"So about a month and a half ago one of my tupperware got stolen. We have a cleaning lady at the office who also does the dishes, and typically everyone leave their tupperwares to be washed by her once they're done eating, and then pick them up at the end of the day from a space on the cafeteria counter were all cleaned tupperwares are left.

One day mine was missing at the end of the day. I asked the cleaning lady and the receptionist girl (who's in charge of the cafeteria restocking so she was the 'figure of authority' there) about it the next day, and even left a note on the wall next to the clean tupperwares counter for about a week but it never turned up. Although the note I had written had gotten vandalized (""Help! My mom is gonna scold me for losing it!!"" they wrote on it), I chose to think that someone had just mistaken it for theirs, and that the vandalized note was a just a prank, so I took down the note and went on with my life.

Last week however, yet another tupperware of mine got stolen. At this point I became suspicious; this was the second time this happened in a span of less than two months, and now I was wondering if this had never been an accident at all, moreso because the one that went missing this time around had a design (red lid, rectangular and made of glass) that the majority of the others in the office didn't (almost all the others are made from plastic), at least not one I had ever seen in the two years I had worked there, so how could it have been mistaken for another one?

Because the tupperware that got stolen was part of a two-set where both of them are identical, I took a picture of the one that got left at home so I could show it the next day to the cleaning lady, the receptionist, and this time my boss to let them know of what had happened, and what the lost one looked like.

(One thing of note is that while these two tupperware are identical, one of them had gotten a tear on the lid, while the other one remained unbroken. The one that had gotten ""lost"" was the tearless one (T) while the one that remained at home had the tear in it (BT), and the picture I had taken was evidence of that. This fact is important later on).

So the next day I tell everyone I had planned of what happened, cleaning lady and receptionist girl are concerned since this is the second time it happened (cleaning lady said she left it in the counter with the others) and my boss just tells me that it was probably an accident and it'll hopefully turn up again. I once again leave up a note in the wall next to the counter (this one wasn't vandalized), and hope for the best.

Monday morning of this week I pack up my lunch in (BT) and head to the office at around 7:30 am. I'm the first to arrive, I put my food away and notice that (T) is still missing from the counter, so I just go to my cubicle and start my day.

At around 10:00 am I head to the cafeteria for a glass of water, and lo and behold, (T) was in the counter! It was right underneath my note, so surely it was being returned to me. As I approach to pick it up however, I notice that (T)'s lid has a tear on it, on the exact same place where (BT) has one. For a weird moment I think, ""did someone actually took (BT) out of the fridge and threw away my food just to put this here?"", but when I go to check the fridge I notice that (BT) is indeed still there, food and all. So (T) was returned to me after all, did it get a tear as well while it was ""missing""? But as I go in to retrieve (BT) from the fridge and I hold it on my hands, I realize that (BT)'s lid was completely smooth now.

They had changed the lids.

I was honestly stunned at this. I knew for a FACT because of the picture I took that the tupperware I had left on the fridge was the one WITH the tear on it (BT), and that the one that had gotten lost was the one WITHOUT the tear (T). And yet, when (T) turns up, it has a tear on the lid, and the one in the fridge (BT) is suddenly tearless? What the hell?? The only possible explanation here is that whoever returned (T) changed the lids with (BT) on the fridge, but why on earth would they do that??? I can only think of this being a way to mess with me, since this is such a little thing to do that it just sounds crazy to try to explain t someone, something easily dismissed as ""oh you're just remembering wrong, why would someone do this?"", and if I couple that with the fact that my note about my very first tupperware that ""went missing"" was vandalized, seemingly to mock me...

I told everyone who knew of the situation that the tupperware was returned, but didn't mention the lid switching. Honestly, I don't know if I should, cause it's a little unnerving to me that someone would go to these lengths to... what, exactly? I don't know, all I know is that I'm not leaving my tupperware unattended anymore, but I just don't know what to make of this incident. Is this a one-time thing? Or something that's gonna keep escalating as time goes on?

I hope it's the former.

TL;DR: One of my tupperware that was part of two-set got stolen at the office. On the day that I brought to the office the one that had remained at home, the lost one turned up but it had its lids switched with the one I brought in for seemingly no reason other than to mess with me.",2018-03-15 17:42:59
Video store at Netflix Inception,65,83bsnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/83bsnc/video_store_at_netflix_inception/,3,1520643878.0,"SO,

I managed a video store during their downfall. The company decided to close my store. When they did, they offered me another position as a part time clerk at another location. I declined and that was all that was said about my employment.

Flash forward a month, and we close the store and I turn in my keys, but have heard nothing at all about ""termination"" or ""record of employment"" so I roll with it.

Two weeks later I think I get my last cheque in the mail. Two weeks after that I get, what I am now sure is, my last cheque. Then 6 weeks after my last shift I get a third cheque....

Now I'm not one to accrue debts, so I call payroll, give my employee ID and store number and ask if anything is wrong. She tells me no. I ask if these calls are recorded, to which she says yes, and get her employee number.

Flash forward again to 4 months later when I get a letter asking for all the wages to be returned.

I call my district manager, ask what the letter is about. Am told ""YOU KNOW WHAT ITS ABOUT!"" I ask if ""I was ever terminated officially"" ""I'LL CALL YOU BACK!""

Flash forward just once more to 11 years later, as I type this. No call back.

Another person that doesn't understand copyright at a copy and print center!,91,82sivo,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/82sivo/another_person_that_doesnt_understand_copyright/,13,1520462073.0,"Hello! I work at a copy and print center at a certain nationwide store chain, where we copy, print, fax, scan, etc. I post here often since I recently found this subreddit, so that might sound familiar.

At my job, we get people that come in to get party invitations printed and cut (we offer cutting services too). This is a rough area we have to deal with, because 1 out of 5 of these invitations that we receive either online or over the counter have some sort of copyrighted material on them, and we have a very strict copyright policy, so we have to explain why we can't print or reproduce their item and turn these people away, which usually doesn't end well.

A lady came in yesterday to get some sort of party invitations printed. My co-worker opened the file on the work PC, and there was Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse plastered in plain sight in the middle of the invitation. Noticing this, my co-worker showed the lady the invitation on the screen and said, ""We cannot print this because there's Disney characters on the invitation, which is considered copyrighted material.""

The lady made that angry face customers usually make when they're upset, and said with a sharp and loud tone, ""WHAT?! I just had these printed at that other store not too long ago!"" My co-worker said, ""Well, I'm sorry, but I cannot print these. It's against company policy. These are easily recognizable Disney characters."" She basically repeated what she said about three times. My co-worker called the manager over, and she went off on her tantrum on him. My manager said, ""I understand that the other store printed these before, but we are not supposed to print these under any circumstance. It is copyright. I'm sorry, ma'am."" Eventually, the lady called out, ""Well, if you aren't gonna help me, then I'm gonna go to that other store!"" and stormed out.

After this whole fiasco, my co-worker, who gets anxiety easily, was alittle upset. My manager went up to him and said, ""Copying copyrighted material is against policy. You were completely right, and I'm glad you did the right thing.""

You'd be surprised how often this happens. It happens maybe once or twice a week: Customer brings in copyrighted materal; We explain why we can't reproduce it; Customer gets upset.

I don't think it'll ever stop lol.",2018-03-08 00:34:33

I work at a copy and print department at a certain nationwide store, where people bring us stuff to get copied, faxed, laminated, etc. 

There's this one customer that comes in that literally no one likes. He came in yesterday to get something enlarged. Pretty typical stuff, but what he wanted enlarged was pretty odd. He wanted an article about ""why girls in the 1960s are more pretty than girls in the modern age"" enlarged to fit an 8.5 by 11 sheet of paper. 

I brought it back there to try and enlarge it. I did, and text got cut off on the right side, so I tried different settings. I held the messed up page in my hand and I started reading some of it out of morbid curiosity. The first paragraph talked about how they were prettier back then because ""junk food wasn't easily accessible back then.""

This old dude always brings in the weirdest stuff. A co-worker said that he brought in a picture of a famous celebrity that had dreads. He said he wanted a copy of it to send to his son to show him how he shouldn't do his hair, cause ""That preppy bullsh*t looks ridiculous.""

Idk why he still goes into public if he's so hateful and miserable.

Tale of a Clown: Clown vs. Metal Detector,45,81azhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/81azhw/tale_of_a_clown_clown_vs_metal_detector/,0,1519957352.0,"*… or, I swear I’m not a suspicious looking person!*

&nbsp;

In college, I worked as a clown.  Yes, full costume/makeup.  During summers while I was at home, I worked for a company that handled all the payments and scheduling.  They hired out clowns (and bouncy houses) for birthday parties, company picnics and the occasional promotional event.

&nbsp;

One day, I was scheduled for a company/family event that was held at the local $SomeGovernmentBranch headquarters.  I don’t remember who the event was for, but there were kids and I was hired for entertainment.

This was a summer or two after 9/11, and, being a government facility, security was heightened.  No problem, I think…

Coming into the facility, the guards by the metal detector looked alert, but amused.  They were expecting a clown.  They wave me over to the metal detector and x-ray machine and explain to enter, I need to log in, and go through the machine.  No problem, I think…

I log in, put my bag through the metal detector, and empty my pockets of the obvious metal: keys, wallet with change, my name badge that’s pinned on, and a couple magic tricks with metal bits.  I figure the rest doesn’t have metal, so it shouldn’t be a problem.  I step through the metal detector.

&nbsp;

**BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!**

&nbsp;

Oops.  I step back through (beep!) and take a minute or two to really empty my pockets.  I have lots of pockets.


Juggling balls… Sponge Balls… Handkerchiefs… deck of cards… a few magic gimmicks… Nothing metal, but it fills up a tray, and my pockets are empty.  One of the amused guards inspects the contents as I step through the metal detector, again.

&nbsp;

**BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!**

&nbsp;

I’m confused this time.  I know my pockets are empty.  The guard comes over with a wand and waves it over me.

As it reaches one of my pockets: *beep! beep! beep!*

I put my hand in my pocket and feel a bit of metal… on the back of my hand.  It’s a safety pin holding on an oversized, plastic button.  They’re just decorative bits on the costume.  If I didn’t have my white makeup on, it would have been obvious I was blushing from embarrassment.

I show the guard and offer to remove the buttons (I had four of them, total).  He finishes waving the wand over me (beeping at each button) and waves me on.

I take a few minutes to fill my pockets back up.  I pick up my bag and head towards the courtyard they are holding the event in.",2018-03-02 04:22:32

**Full Story**

-------------------

It was another normal night at the Copy and Print center at Office Depot. I was closing that night, and usually, nights aren't very busy at all, so I was just doing some print jobs in the back. I see a dude walking up through the line, and I noticed that he kinda looked upset. I didn't think much of it, walk over, and say ""How may I help you?"" I see him texting someone on his phone, then he said, ""Oh. Yeah. I need to get something printed off my phone. Can you help me email it?"" This is normal for me, so I reply, ""Absolutely. Can I see your phone?"" He hands it over with the PDF pulled up, and I start doing what I usually do: hit the share button, hit GMail/Yahoo Mail/Default Mail App/etc, then type in the email address.

I hit the share button, and I saw a chat bubble in the corner with a girl's selfie on it. I didn't think much of it cause I didn't care. After the Share options roll up from the bottom of the screen, I see the chat bubble pop out a message. It read, ""I'm sorry. I don't think it's working out between us."" I kinda froze cause I didn't know what to do. He saw the message and hastily swiped it away, saying, ""Oh. Sorry about that.""

I email the file, open it up on the PC, and print it out. When I go to the printer to fetch his printed papers, I just kept thinking about what happened. I was thinking, ""Well damn. No wonder the guy is upset. Him and his girlfriend were having troubles, and then I just witnessed his girlfriend break up with him."" After that, the guy didn't say much, and was hastily texting the girl. After I checked him out and told him, ""Have a good night,"" he left with his head down.

I try to stop him, but he thinks he didn't do it and refuses to listen to me. Transaction completes and I hand him cash back, and he starts a scene in front of the store and refuses to take his own money, even after manager comes over and says we can't do anything about it.

----------------

**Full Story**

----------------

It was another normal day at the copy and print department I work at, and I see that one customer walked in. He's a tall guy and an older dude, and the long-time employees usually sigh when they catch sight of him. He's a s**t starter, usually catching an attitude with anyone he communicates with. Long before he caused the scene, he was butting into me and another customer who we're trying to make business cards. The customer asks how his day is going, and he starts this whole thing about why ""How's your day going?"" is a rude question. I forgot what he said cause he talks so fast. 

After he talks to different people about weird stuff, I get to checking him out and getting him on his way. I ring his prints up and he inserts his card. After violently telling the tiny card reader he wanted his receipt printed, he puts his card in. Then, we get to the cash back screen. I watched him pick up the touchscreen pen, and hit ""$20"" violently. He then goes and hits ""None"" about five times violently. I stop him from entering his pin and ask ""Did you want $20 cashback or no cashback? I think you hit $20 by accident."" He gave me a look and said ""I didn't hit no cash back. I hit none. You saw me."" Then proceeded to go on about how cash back is a fraud (which is BS, but okay. Whatever. I'll listen to him. I don't have a choice), and somehow gets on the topic about how things like chicken at supermarkets is not real chicken. After that whole speech, I checked my monitor, and sure enough, it said ""Cashback selected for $20.00."" After he enters his pin, I then tell him that it says he selected $20 Cashback. He was like, ""Boy. I already told you No. I hit none on the screen."" The transaction finalizes, and I pull out $20 from the register, cause he asked for $20 cashback. I hand him the receipt, and he saw the $20 bill, and asked, ""What's this?"" I told him his cashback.

And this is when the s**t hits the fan.

He stood up straight and raised his tone at me, saying ""I said No cashback! Why you handing me this damn money?!"" I stay calm and tell him, ""I can try to refund it, okay? Let me see the receipt."" I call over from some help, and my fellow associate said, ""Yeah. Idk how to refund cashbacks. You should ask the manager."" I call the manager over, and she told him, ""Yeah. I don't think we can refund cashbacks."" He then says, ""Well, I won't take it. I didn't ask for no cashback. I have enough money in my wallet. See?"" He then pulls out his wallet and opens the money pouch to show us, for some reason. My manager then calls the help desk at the Office Depot headquarters in Florida, and they said that they cannot refund cashbacks. 

Keep in mind what a cashback is. It basically pulls money out from your bank, and turns it into cash that you get as change from the register. It's a courtesy, and does not lower your wealth at all. So the way that the guy would refuse to take it is ridiculous, because he could go deposit it into his bank, and he would be back into normalcy like he never did a cashback.

My manager tried to void the transaction, but found out that it wouldn't refund the cashback. It would only refund what he paid for, which was the prints, and he STILL refused to take the cashback. After causing a scene in front of a line of about 3 people, calling my manager and I liars a couple times, he eventually gave up and stormed out with his own money.

So, basically, the guy was refusing to take his own money. That's literally the whole situation. It was a minor mistake that he overblew into making us look like we were refusing to help him. We literally couldn't help him, cause a cashback is not made to be a refundable item. It's a courtesy, through and through.

It was nice to get this off my chest, cause it made me so upset.

Enjoy:

Context of this post: Management has had a tumultuous month with *employee*.  She officially put in her actual notice (in writing) --day, November --, 2017 so hopefully this won't continue to escalate.  That said, I unfortunately believe it will.  She's on the schedule in ""location"" through December -- which means I'll have 4 more interactions with her and I honestly have no clue what the outcome of that will be.  My experience with *employee* and the issues that have come up in the past between her and other co-workers is that *employee* tends to overthink interactions and situations.  She often rewrites what happened, and is able to convince herself of intentions, thoughts, and actions from the other party that just weren't there.  I'm providing this as my personal account of events to the best of my recollection.  Obviously if nothing comes of this, you are free to disregard. 


-------------------------------------------------------------


*Employee*: Timeline of Events 


October -- - *Employee* was a no-call/no-show.  *Manager* made contact with her approximately 45 minutes after her shift had started.  She showed up but was visibly distraught over a rash that had broken out on her palm and so she was given the day off - after *Manager* informed her that due to policy, *employee* would be on a final warning for the next 30 days.  That week, *employee* made it clear to multiple team members that she felt *Manager* was cold and it was cruel of her to not care about her medical condition more.


October -- - *employee* was still very upset about being on a final warning and *Manager's* approach to putting her on warning.  And was very frightened she was getting axed immediately.  I tried to reason with her that although it's our policy, the management team has discernment and takes extenuating circumstances into account.  I reminded *employee* that we've never had an issue with her attendance before and to not let it get to her head.  I felt, at the time, that I'd gotten through to her and she was no longer actively afraid of immediate termination.


November -- - *employee* was an hour late (traffic was bad), but was in communication.


November -- - *employee* was a no-call/no-show for an hour.  She had apparently called in on time (before the store opened), but reached out to the store phone number (that she knows is put on ""Do Not Disturb"" each evening as she's the one responsible for taking it off ""Do Not Disturb"" each morning at 9:00 a.m., when we open.)  I believe at 45 minutes late she actually reached out to *Manager's* cell phone.  She was understandably shaken due to having been involved in a minor traffic incident, sliding her car off the road in the snow.  She was given the rest of the day off. 


November -- - When I spoke with her about it the next day she acted confused as to why it counted as a no-call/no-show, as in her mind she'd left a voicemail on the store phone.  I reminded her that it went straight to vm, and that in orientation I was very clear that the policy stated that actual contact had to be made with the manager on duty. I asked her directly why she hadn't reached out to *Manager's* cell phone initially.  She told me she didn't have *Manager's* number.  Even though she had reached out to *Manager* multiple times before and also managed to find it again 45 minutes after she left the vm on the ""Do Not Disturb"" phone that was straight to vm. She stood by her assertion that it being considered a no-call/no-show was unfair and undeserved.


*employee*  informed *Manager* that this isn't going to work out for her long term due to the commute.  She wrote her desire to leave in a *group communication app* message and sent it to myself, *co-worker*, and *co-worker* (our reception team).  I verified with *employee* in person that her intention was to leave.  She informed me that she will not leave us hanging but whenever we can get someone in and trained, she'll be done.  I had a conversation with her to reassure her that if she wants to work something out with us, I'm sure there's an option somewhere.  I informed her that from my perspective, the first time being late and then *Manager's* approach to putting her on warning just threw her off.  It sent her into a tail spin mentally where she worked up the issue so large in her head that she started creating the very thing she was scared of - being late.  I let her know that if she was only quitting out of fear of being fired, that we should discuss other options first.  She seemed resolute and continued to inform the team that this isn't the right fit for her long term.


November -- - (this seems like it is off-topic, but it factors in later) *other employee on same team as ultra cray lady* let me know that she's afraid to ask for a raise.  I tried to give her a little coaching but she got aggressive in her body language and repeated twice that ""Other places are starting to look really good"".  I am already worried that we're needing to train a replacement for *ultra cray lady / employee* so I reached out to ""GM"" to request that he initiate a conversation with *2nd place cray /other employee* to hopefully avoid another reception team member needing to be replaced.  According to ""GM"", the meeting was productive.


November -- - I came in around 10 and heard the *ultra cray lady / employee* in office with *GM* loudly exclaiming that she was very confused as to why all the employees kept coming up to ask her when she was leaving.  She stated that she never put in her notice.  And that if anyone interpreted it as such, they were misunderstanding her.  I inserted myself into the conversation at this point as I was someone who had actually been in communication with her about this and could speak to the inconsistencies in her newest version of events.  After speaking with her and *GM* at length, she was willing to concede that she understood why people thought she was leaving, but that she was, in fact, staying.  In it for the long haul! Going so far as to even tentatively work out a schedule change that would have her switching some of her weekday shifts for weekend ones in order to mitigate the traffic challenges she faced on the commute.  She told me that her and *2nd place cray /other employee* are getting along and that they want to do a *industry* appreciation night out together as a team.  I agreed, we set tentative plans for December --.  I am relieved that the problem seems to have worked itself out.


Later in the day (here's where that seemingly off topic bit with *2nd place cray / other employee* merges in with the issues with *ultra cray lady / employee*) I was made aware that *2nd place cray /other employee* spent the weekend telling many employees that I humiliated her extremely due to the impromptu meeting she had with *GM* on Friday.  I'm assuming she made the correct assumption that the meeting with *GM* was a direct response to the interaction that her and I had earlier that same afternoon.  I made plans with *GM* to have a meeting with her.  And I reached out to her via ""group communication app""  to apologize for the way she had interpreted my actions.  She never responded.  Professionally I am disappointed and frustrated that my reputation for being approachable and solution oriented may be called into question based on the things *2nd place cray /other employee* is telling people.  Personally I am emotionally spent.  It feels like I can't ever do the right thing for my team; each action I take just ends up upsetting everyone.  I started to realize that I'm getting far too involved.  I did some research and discovered that my management style mimics the characteristics of ""Reactive Management"".  I realized that I've gotten too emotionally invested and needed to back off in order to maintain professionalism in the work place.  I decided at that moment that the last thing I want to be doing with my free time away from work is ""working"" on making my team 💞like💞 each other; I just want them to be professional and be competent in their positions.  And so considering that we had only just made the plans three hours prior for the ""industry"" appreciation night in December, I reached out to the team to let them know that I was unfortunately not going to be able to make it after all.


November -- - *ultra cray lady / employee* did not like that I was not going. She tried repeatedly that day to change my mind.  At one point she approached me saying ""I'm sorry I did something that makes you not want to hang out with me"".  I was firm in my decision but I made it very clear it had nothing to do with her.


November -- - After having not succeeded in convincing me the day prior, she tried a fresh approach and came in to talk to *GM* about the necessity of me being at the ""industry"" night with them.  *GM* approached me about it and I let him know where I was at with everything.  I can remain professional with people in the workplace even if I'm not hanging out with them outside of it.  And I personally don't appreciate having my decisions being disrespected.  I am allowed to make decisions about my personal life independently of other's preferences.


Right before midnight (*ultra cray lady / employee*)  sent a message to the reception team in *group communication app* that said ""I do appreciate you all!  But peace out for now and appreciate any future LOVE"" and 15 minutes later sent a weird email to *GM* and myself.


November -- - I woke up to a missed call at approximately 7:30 a.m. and an email apologizing for the one she had sent in the middle of the night.  I called her back and left a voicemail and she never responded.  I addressed the topics in the email she had sent in the middle of the night via email but never got a response.  She came in on her day off to present *Manager* with a written two week notice.


November -- - I had not seen or heard from *ultra cray lady / employee* directly since the strange messages and when I came in to the store, she wasn't engaging with me at all, which is uncharacteristic.  I waited an hour or two - and then I asked what day was her last day. She said she didn't know.  Through the course of our brief conversation regarding her leaving, I had shared that hearing it second hand had hurt a little because I had thought we were on friendly terms with open communication.  She turned on me real quick, accusing me of ignoring her call (when really I was just sleeping because we work different shifts and she's at the store much earlier than me).  I tried to remind her of that and highlight that I had called back as soon as I saw the missed call.  I even had left a voicemail but had not heard back from her. She just launched into how we're not friends, we're just co-workers, because I never hang out with her outside of work.  She shared that she felt I abandoned her at the first hint of *2nd place cray / other employee* being difficult with me (news flash: my relationship with *2nd place cray / other employee* has always been fraught with hostility) and she's had to put up with it for months so that makes me weak and unfair for expecting her to deal with something I refuse to.  And other things that I can't quite keep track of because I wasn't expecting such vitriol.  My impression by the end of talking to her, was that had I just gone to the ""industry"" event she would have been as happy as a clam and everything would have been fine.  Which in my opinion is ludicrous.  My job description does not maintain that I must have friendships with my coworkers outside of the workplace.


November -- - I said hi when I came into the store.  I did not engage with *ultra cray lady / employee* on anything not work related.  I had to ask her about my tips that were missing which I know frazzled her.  But I made it clear that I wasn't upset, just trying to track them down.  Other than that I didn't really interact with her.  I kept my distance.  I thought everything was fine but after she left I was told she was complaining about all the looks and whispers and wanted to talk to HR.


Luckily she left. She stayed through the last day of her notice and then disappeared... I'm still reveling in the lack of her existence. By the way, *2nd place cray / other employee* ended up also leaving as well.

So, we have a regularly scheduled team meeting each Wednesday where I first thought would be a good place to ask questions.  Turns out the since November when I joined, only one of these meetings have occurred.  Early on, they were cancelled, but now just ignored.

So I've started emailing requesting help with mostly the framework details that I can't reverse engineer on my own from this completely undocumented, uncommented code base.  But these are ignored as well.

My next attempt at getting help is to just show up at the other team members door and ask in person, but my couple attempts at that to date, I never managed to get them out of their office to come look at my code.

What this? We no order this!,36,7vw8zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/7vw8zt/what_this_we_no_order_this/,2,1518011962.0,"TL;DR at the bottom


A few years ago, while I had just finished school and was waiting for my college classes to start, I was working for a company that tried to inform people about some services the government offers. They'd send out employees who asked every household whether they'd like information on these services and if they'd say yes, the company would collect all flyers, etc. about the service the customer would like to learn about, put them in an envelope and deliver it to them by hand.

I was doing these deliveries, which esentially is the work of any courier who delivers packages. It was really important that we delivered the envelopes to the exact person who ordered it (due to some marketing stuff about personal interaction), so if the person wasn't home or didn't answer the door, we'd have to take the envelope back to the office and try again the next day. 


This particular day was pretty good. Almost all of the people remembered that they ordered the information (it was completely free for them, because it was government-funded), nobody yelled at me for not throwing it into their mailbox, no creepy guy asked me to come in and have coffee with him (yeah, that happened. I was a 17 y/o girl and it freaked me out) and they were overall pretty nice. I then came to an apartment complex, wanting to deliver an envelope to a man with a foreign sounding last name (note that I'm from Europe, so my native language isn't english). This was nothing unusual working in a big city, so I rang, smiled at the older man who opened the door and said my usual line:

Me: 'Hi! My name's anon, I'm from company xyz and I'm bringing the ordered information flyers. Are you Mr. last name?'

Him: ??? *starts talking in foreign language*

Me: (in english) 'Sorry, I don't understand you. Do you speak english by any chance?'

He continued talking in the foreign language.

Me: (getting desperate and thinking of any language I had ever learned in school) 'Vous parlez francais? Habla espanol?' 

Still no reaction, so I show him the envelope with the name on it and look at him. I now talk slowly and say 'Did you order this?'

He's turning around and yelling into the apartment. A girl, about my age appears, who speaks my native language. Not great, but good enough to be understandable.

Girl: 'What up?'

Me: 'Someone in your apartment ordered these flyers about [government service].'

Older woman appears in the door, probably the mother. She starts yelling in foreign language, while the girl tries to explain to her father what's happening. The man starts throwing up his hands and get louder. He's yelling into the apartment again. 2 more girls appear behin him. They are now all talking to each other really loudly, while I'm still standing at the door. It's been over 5 minutes now, maybe even 10.

Girl: 'Yes, is our name, but dad not order this. What this?'

I'm starting to sweat now as it's freezing outside and I'm wearing like 4 jackets and a scarf, but obviously these clothes are too warm in the heat of the building. So I'm trying to explain the service to her and that someone ordered the information, while the rest of the family is still yelling at each other.

After another 2 - 3 minutes another door in the apartment opened and I saw a young man, probably in his early twenties, asking what was wrong. He's loudly greeted by 5 of his family members, while I hold up the envelope and give it another try.

Me: 'I'm from company xyz and I'm bringing the ordered flyers. Was ist you who ordered them by any chance?'
Guy: (with a big smile and perfectly fluent in my native language) 'Yeah, thanks so much! Sorry for the hassle with my family.'

Me: 'No problem. Bye!'

All of them are staring at him, a moment of silence.


He then closed the door, and while I was standing there dumbfounded I could hear the confused talking/yelling again. Wow. Didn't know getting informational flyers about governmental services could get that exciting.


Just to make this clear: They weren't unpleasant at all and they weren't yelling angrily. They were just talking really loudly, probably because they tried to be louder than the TV. I just had to think of this incident when I was reading through all of these 'Talesfrom' subreddits and thought you might like the story.



TL;DR: It took me more than 10 minutes to hand over an envelope because nobody knew who ordered it.

Just put in my two weeks.,52,7tbtw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/7tbtw7/just_put_in_my_two_weeks/,3,1517046233.0,"I had a meeting today with my boss, whom I almost never see because I work the grave shift. She talked about moving the schedule around so that people could learn all aspects of the job (its a small business). And everything went well, we caught up, came up with some ideas and I left thinking I'd be getting some more stuff to do during the very boring night shift.

So I came in to work tonight after the meeting and I went upstairs to the office/breakroom area. And I'll admit it, I snooped a little. I just glanced over to see if there was anything on my boss's desk referencing the meeting we had earlier. I saw that she was writing notes so I figured I could see what info she deemed important enough to write down.

Right in the middle of her desk was a ""mock up"" work schedule. Another employee had written on the side of it some stuff that basically said, ""here's what the schedule would look like if [my name here] was gone.""

Ok, so this was printed 3 days ago, when she had initially tried to schedule the meeting before it getting put off until today. 
She was totally gonna fire me! But instead, she actually communicated with me and decided she wanted me to learn more about the job and blah blah blah.

I no longer feel like I have job security here, and the incredibly poor communication has been a nightmare to work with. Seriously, she only communicates by text, and never responds. So I Just put in my two weeks. My resignation is right next to her ""mock"" schedule. 

At least she won't need the two weeks to find my replacement since the schedule is already there lol. 

She could have at least put it somewhere less obvious! I mean she had a fellow employee make it so I can just imagine she was like.. ""hey, so I'm thinking about firing [me], could you figure that out for me?"" 

Fuck that.. at least be honest with me, let me know what the hell is going on before you decide to plan ahead without me. I also thought it was weird that she wanted her assistant person present during our meeting, but I assume it was so that she could have a witness for the firing or whatever. 

I've been thinking about leaving for a while anyway, so I guess I'll just take this as an opportunity. 

LESSON: communication solely through text is dehumanizing and a terrible way to run a business.

tldr: had a meeting w/boss that went well, but later found a mock up schedule that proved she wanted to fire me at that meeting. So I put my resignation next to the pre-made schedule. ",2018-01-27 11:43:53

So, we all have that one co-worker who just seems oblivious to some things. Mine is my line partner. I work for a LARGE multinational product manufacturer as a technician team lead over three lines and six people. This role comes with quite a bit more responsibility than the other line technician roles, but with a pay increase to match. It does NOT come with commiserate authority. Members of my team can respond to my requests with a firm “f*!k off,” and there's nothing I can do about it. 

My leadership style, I like to think, is to lead from the front. I don't ask anything of my team that I won't do myself. As long as they do their jobs, and don't bring management down on me for what they are/’t doing, I won't call them out on small things. Play on your phone a bit? No problem. Take long breaks? Go ahead. As long as your line runs good product at rate, and you are on the line for all planned work, go ahead, be my guest. Just don't give management anything to talk to me about. We all have a line partner to work this out with, me included as I am expected to run the line as part of my job. We help each other, beak each other, and cover for each other. 

If you noticed, I have an of number of team members, including myself. One of my lines only has one technician, without a line partner. I am the only other person on my team qualified to operate this line. This means, that aside from working my designated line with my partner, I also have to act as partner to the other technician and cover their beaks, help with any problems they have. Other line operator paid can, and often do, alternate ling breaks. Hour on, hour off type breaks. Again, I doing care as long as your lunge is running well, and you are three for your work when needed. We don't have a very physically demanding job. Well, my line partner doesn't seem to understand that we can't really take hour long breaks anymore, otherwise we will miss some of our breaks, which they then complain about. During our 12 Hour shifts, we should get five beaks, one every two hours. Since I have to break two people, if everyone takes hour long beaks we will only get four breaks at most. So, we should all take slightly shorter beaks, half hour even. We will all get all or beaks. But no, he insists on taking hour breaks. So the other operator decides to take hour breaks. Now I only get really short breaks unless I want to getting bitched  at. 

So, I guess, rant over. 

TL:DR line partner used to working as a pair can't seem to get working as a two man group, refuses to change ways, causing missed breaks and complaining. Because 30 minute breaks are too short...

My bad experience with Amazon,49,7pr137,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/7pr137/my_bad_experience_with_amazon/,10,1515702545.0,"So before I get into the negative part of this discussion I'll say that Amazon in my area offers decent pay/hours, and the benefits start on your first day.

We had a decent selection of food in our lunch area, water coolers were located next to every staircase. We had arcade machines, and free Powerade in the break rooms. Management also takes proper body mechanics very seriously, which I appreciated.

That's about the only good thing I can say though.

I'm a runner, and I'm not one to shy away from being on my feet 10 hours a day. I can honestly say that I didn't have the same issue others have had with being tired or sore. The issues I had with Amazon were entirely with management.

From what I've noticed, Amazon has an extremely high turn over. For every one person that quits, Amazon will hire twenty more. It's not about building a quality worker, and breaking down barriers. It's about getting through each day by the skin of your teeth. If you don't succeed, there is no try again...in the words of a little green creature man, do or do not, there is no try.

I was stuck as a picker which wasn't even my assigned department. I was given only one day of training, and told by countless people that if my rate wasn't 100% that I would be fired. I was always proactive about the issues I was having, and all of my comments or concerns fell on deaf ears. When my manager finally decided that I needed to be reeducate, they had someone follow me around for about an hour. That was the extent of the help I was able to receive. The training is very poor, and most of the time the ambassadors act like working for Amazon is a joke. This is not a great way to make new hires feel confident in the job they're just beginning. Our ambassador was actually half asleep through most of our training and gave our group advice on ways to skip out on our jobs.


From the day that I started as a picker I spent a good 90% of my time stuck on fracs, picking from large item bins, and having to run 15 or 20 isles to get from one item to the next. Management had mentioned during stand ups that they realized the issues with the pick paths and would divide up the fracs path so everyone had to work it. This was not true. The same week I worked fracs the entirety of my shifts, all five of them...the full 50 hours.

Our facility is over capacity, and bin presentation is nonexistent. The people who put the items in the bins would rather stand and talk in large groups, and just shove the items in the bins when they do work. This makes it impossible for pickers to pick one item every twenty seconds. Sometimes you find yourself standing in front of the bin with an arm full of items looking for that one thing you need. Sometimes you find the item buried in the bottom, and other times you spend two or three minutes in the bin only to realize the item isn't there.

My managers had no real advice for me on how to deal with sorting through the bins other than ""know what you're looking for before you get to your next bin, and this will help you manage your time better"".

That's right! Amazon's solution to finding a needle in a haystack is telling employees to know what a needle looks like, and to ignore the hay.

Amazon is not a company you work for if you're looking for long term job security. You're not a person. You're a machine, and you will be treated like one. If you do not perform to the level they've set for you, then regardless of the reasons or the issues you might be facing, you will be fired. It was my experience that a lot of their employees spend their days looking over their shoulders wondering if this day would be their last, and management would not shy away from constantly reminding their workers of all the ways they could lose their jobs(negative upt, quality dings, low rate).

It really just put a bad taste in my mouth, because coming from a background in various GM positions, I understand the importance or moral in the workplace. Happy employees equal productive employees. There's no better way to kill a persons desire to strive and work hard than making that individual hate what he does, or by threatening him with his job when he struggles to meet your expectations.

Writing a critical email to a previous manager,30,7oo2za,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/7oo2za/writing_a_critical_email_to_a_previous_manager/,7,1515294067.0,"I wanted to get folks opinion on this matter, as I may just be angry and irrationally reacting to a situation.

I will try to be brief..  

I worked at a large corporation for a few years, and left because I felt the environment was toxic and did not promote growth.  In fact my manager stifled growth, was incredibly passive aggressive and would shame his employees.  Things hit a boiling point on the team, and I was the third person to quit from my team in 1 month.  After me 2 more left and 2 were fired.  Yesterday one of my former colleagues was fired for seemingly unreasonable reasons.  I do not know the specifics, but when I worked with this former colleague they were competent and someone I could trust.  I am pissed off because I feel like my former manager has no business being in a position where he can fire or hire people.  He is potentially damaging people's careers and is blatantly lying to potential candidates, telling them that this is a job where you will grow and learn.  

While I was at the job I spoke up, and I gave a scathing but factual exit interview, nothing ever changed.  Even after the 5th person quit within 5 months, nothing has changed.  After my former colleague was fired yesterday, I started drafting up a letter to send to my former manager, his bosses (director and VP), and his peers (other managers), and HR.  I doubt this will do anything, but I wanted to give my opinion on the matter, backed up by factual events, and refraining from negative language or name calling.  The letter is detailing on why I quit, and why I think everyone else felt the need to leave.  

It may be too little too late, but it did take some time after I quit to clear my mind and reflect on years I spent at the job.

Does anyone think this is a waste of time or something worth doing?

I was reading a story on here that reminded me of another one of my diner days when I was a dishwasher at a diner a couple of years ago.


It was a very slow day and I was doing prep work in the back kitchen because we had no customers and there was **nothing** else we could do. Finally, these two gargantuans; (they were huge) a husband and wife come in and order about half the menu. I didn't know two people could eat so much food. They finish eating and the husband goes to the bathroom for an uncomfortable amount of time. He comes out, they pay and leave. All quiet again.


The waitresses had started cleaning the bathrooms and went into the men's room. I was washing lettuce with cold water and chatting with one of my bosses when I heard what could only be described as a squealing pig. I threw the head of lettuce back into the bowl and we both run out to see what on earth the problem was. We got toward the men's room when the smell of sulfur mixed with rotting flesh hit me. The husband had clogged the toilet. The waitresses refused to unclog it. I refused to unclog it. My bosses couldn't do it. Both my bosses look at me and say: 


""We will give you the rest of the day off as well as tomorrow with pay if you unclog the toilet.""


At first, I didn't think they were serious and I kind of chuckled at it. They told me it wasn't a joke and they were serious. So, I grab the ~~hazmat suit~~ plunger and head in.


I swear, this dude must've shit boulders. It was hard as a rock. It took me 15 minutes to unclog the toilet because my eyes were watering so much from holding back from vomiting. Eventually, I got it unclogged and flushed the toilet. I was full of sweat. My boss shook my hand, thanked me and told me to go home and take today and tomorrow off. I spent those days showering.


This was when I liked working there. It started declining a few months after, which is a story for another day.  ",2018-01-05 16:12:31

We have a fairly large arcade and I was working the ticket counter when they called 9 o'clock, so of course I get a mad rush of kids wanting to redeem their tickets for candy, toys, etc. I probably had around 20 kids berating me all at the same time for what they wanted so I call out ""Who knows what they would like"" so I'm not standing around doing nothing waiting for one kid to decide. 
One girl, probably around 13, asks if I can check her ticket balance (its all a card based system no physical tickets). It takes about 10 seconds so I say sure and kindly let her know. She then presides to ask me my least favorite question ""What can I get for that?"" I internally sigh as everything is clearly marked and say ""Why don't you look around and I'll come back to you."" Or at least that's what I and my coworker heard me say.
I start helping another kid and don't even notice her leave until a large black lady comes over shoving through multiple kids and starts yelling at me. (C: Customer M: Me)

C: Is your job to give kids what they want or to be smart?
M: Excuse me?
C: You heard me. You can't be goin around here telling *my* niece stuff like that.
M: I'm not sure what you're referring to? Did I do something while in the arena? (Everyone just kind of does what needs to be done, tickets, snack bar, and I had just gotten out of a session of tag)
C: They're not paying you to be smart. Telling my niece to ""Look with her eyes""

At this point I see what is happening and being tired and still having a bunch of kids around me I just go with it.

M: I'm sorry, whatever I said was not meant to offend. I'm currently trying to deal with multiple children and am currently under a lot of stress. (I open my arms referring to the throng of kids. 
C: I understand that but you can't come bringing your personal life into work and take it out on customers. I work in the mental hospital. You think I would still have a job if I came in yelling and being smart with my patients?

At this point I had no clue what to say but I didn't have to as she quickly left in a huff. A little shaken I go back to helping kids around me.

We spent the whole day on the phone talkng to people in the field.  And even though we had worked together for months, he had never actually called me.  I can't recall why he asked for my number.  But he did.  Without skipping a beat I rattled off extension x9911.  You see where this is going.

Without thinking he then dials it.  What happens, of course, is that he gets an outside line and then dials 911.  And reaches an emergency operator.  He has some explaining to do but smooths it out.  I laugh hysterically.  ",2018-01-02 05:48:00

Christmas Eve morning and the fight that broke out at work.,57,7m62vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/7m62vt/christmas_eve_morning_and_the_fight_that_broke/,4,1514267497.0,"I work in the kitchen of the biggest hospital in my area and was scheduled to work all day on Christmas Eve starting at 6am. For the first part of the day from 6am until 2:30 p.m. our supervisor was a young lady named E and on the line was B, C, K and a few other morning employees. This story revolves around E, B, C another girl named F. 

F came into work at 7 and had accidentally forgotten her work badge at home. Usually when this happens, the person who forgets their badge lets a supervisor know so they can fill out a sheet for a missed swipe in to make sure they get credit for working that day. F told E about her badge as soon as she was in uniform and on the floor. Theoretically, all E had to do was let F fill out a sheet and no worries, right? Wrong.

E is the kind of supervisor that everyone dreads working with. While she doesn't exhibit abusive behavior the way I've read in other stories, she lacks the social and organizational skills and common sense to effectively manage a team of tray passers and assemblers. She has issues with maintaining personal space. gets emotional and ""touchy feely"", micromanages and makes many poor decisions in general that do more to mess things up than help. When F told E that she didn't have a badge to clock in with or get into certain areas of the hospital to deliver patient trays, E for some reason had a mild freak out about how trays were going to be delivered on time. Other than not being able to get to certain units, it's really not that big of a deal to deliver carts without a badge because there are enough people who can take carts to those other areas if one person isn't able to. Rather than just letting F run trays to the areas that she was able to get to and then have her pack silverware in between carts, F decided to pull B, one of the tray assemblers, off of the line to run carts and stick F on the line to assemble trays. Problem solved, right? Wrong.

F is a very new hire and up until that moment had never worked on the tray assembly line, already causing an issue. In addition to pulling B, one of the fastest and most accurate assemblers off of the line to deliver carts, E also had to pull another girl named A off of her position on the line to ""train"" F for about 20 minutes while still expecting her to do her job. B and C went off on E knowing that this would mess up the flow of things and an all out argument started between B, C and E. I went on a delivery run as things got heated.

Now, I mention that E has problems with understanding or at least respecting personal space. I came back to the kitchen about 15 minutes later to grab the next cart and when I got there, B and E were arguing. Not only had E undoubtedly said something to B that only escalated the situation and made her more angry, B kept telling E to give her space and cool down. E followed B around the kitchen staying no further than two or three feet away from her, trying to touch her on the shoulder and get all close and touchy feely with her. At this time, B was also trying to leave with a cart of trays that were about to be due and B looked like she might haul off and smack E at any second if E didn't get out of her face and let her do her job. Meanwhile, F felt so guilty over the whole situation that she ran into the break room after getting so upset she started crying. I left with the next cart and tried to stay out of the kitchen as much as possible for the rest of the time that E was supervising, which was easy to do because her decision to make things more complicated than they had to be put the kitchen at least a half an hour behind on trays being delivered to patients. E is incompetent, micromanaging, irritating and all of us wonder whose idea it was to make her a supervisor.",2017-12-26 07:51:37
A Busy Saturday,41,7kmp2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/7kmp2f/a_busy_saturday/,5,1513618281.0,"I worked for a major storage company for 15 years. I have a great many stories, this is one of them.

I managed a medium-sized property, so there was only one person (me) scheduled at a time. I was in charge of lock check, cleaning property and units, cleaning restroom, restocking packing supplies, leasing of new units, answering calls, and debt collection. And yet, somehow, management still wanted us to be in the office available to customers for the entire day.

It was a pretty Saturday morning, looked to be an easy day, and I was looking forward to my weekend (Sunday/Monday). I had walked the hallways and driven the golf cart for the outside check, so I was ready to start my office work.

A tenant who rented on the back of the property came in and told me that there was mercury spilled along the back driveway. I hadn't seen it when I did my check, so I immediately headed back there to see what was going on.

Sure enough, there were beads of mercury all along the center crevice of the driveway (driveways were shallow V's for drainage). I checked and found more mercury at the base of a door, obviously where it came from. (It turned out a tenant had broken a very large, antique thermometer.)

I immediately went back to the office and called my district manager. No answer, left a message. (This was a Saturday, so no real surprise.) Tried again, no answer. Called the regional manager, no answer, left a message. I tried calling a few numbers at corporate, but absolutely no one wanted to answer their phone that day.

Please keep in mind that this was somewhere around 2011. I had a crappy flip phone, and we did not have internet access in the office. 

I did what I thought needed to be done: I called the non-emergency number for the fire department. The next thing I know I have a huge ladder truck pulling in with lights and sirens going, and firefighters in full gear piling into my office. I led the men to the back of the property and showed them the mercury. They called in their HAZMAT team. Now a giant HAZMAT truck comes screaming down the street and onto the property. I am frantically trying to get in touch with my district manager, to no avail. 

The HAZMAT group, with the help of the firefighters, blocks off the back of the property. They told me that I needed to call a company and have them come clean up the mercury. I don't have that kind of authority (and no way to look that type of thing up, no Google). So I kept calling for my DM, my RM, anyone who knew anything. 

The weather was turning stormy, and they told me that it had to be cleaned up before the rain started, or else. Then another vehicle pulled in. Someone had called the EPA.

I am threatened with huge fines if it starts raining and this mercury hasn't been cleaned up yet. I am now calling district managers for other districts, even other cities, trying to find ANYONE who can help me.

I finally got a call from our divisional vice president (one of the messages I left). I explained to him what was going on. He looked up a company on his computer, and was able to give them his personal credit card ($thousands$) to come out right then and clean up the mercury.

It was 10 minutes until closing as the EPA, the HAZMAT group, and the firefighters finally started trickling away. My office phone rang, and it was my district manager.

He said: ""You called?""

I explained what had happened, from beginning to end.

He said: ""You should have called me first! I would have told you to wash it down the drain.""",2017-12-18 19:31:21

Full discloser- i'm partially blind (juvenile MD, about 20/400 acuity) and i use a white cane. I don't ""look blind,"" in the stereotypical stevie wonder-ish way and this confuses a lot of people. Most people dont realize that there's not just sight and complete blindness. 

Anyway, this student waltzed up to me with an obvious attitude and just goes ""um, i thought you were supposed to be blind. I just saw you looking at someone,"" probably expecting to ""catch"" me for faking or some stupid bullshit like that. I normally don't mind questions, but this kid sounded kinda dickish

So what do i do? I muster up my best over-the-top nice customer service voice and proceed to explain to this dude in full detail how retinas work. You could tell that the guy felt awkward but i just kept going in as creepily friendly of a voice as i could. He tried to end the conversation by mentioning that he wears contacts and that his vision is correctable.  I grinned at him and said ""you know, you could go blind at any point in your life!""

Knowing when to leave your company.,42,7f5zcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/7f5zcf/knowing_when_to_leave_your_company/,2,1511509903.0,"Hi guys,


This was originally for /r/talesfromtechsupport but I was pulled out of my normal SA/techsupport role to be a QA on a project, so I feel as if it fits on /r/talesfromthejob. Essentially my clients were $CEO and $Customer and I was ensuring the information stated in tickets were clear enough for $developers.

This is a mix of IT and project management. I hope most of you benefit from this story as it shows you the **wrong** way to run a business and the signs of when to say adios to a company when things are just not right.


**Tl;dr at bottom**


Terms you need to know:
**$CEO:** CEO of my company


**$Supervisor:** CEO now lives in California, Supervisor is the company's receptionist/accountant. Knows nothing of IT.


**Smartsheets** - Excel on crack for project-management but not as good as MSProject.


**osTicket** - A helpdesk ticket system but can be utilized for projects for bug reports.


**SA** - System Admin: Different for a lot of companies but they are the go to guy in small companies for IT needs


**QA** - Quality Assurance: Software testing in terms of an IT world.


**Stakeholder** - ""an individual, group, or organization, who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project"" -- for a company 


I've been filling this SA (System Admin) slot at a small company for 3 years now and it has given me a good grasp on not only being an SA but other disciplines of IT. It has been for the most part very educational but I find that this small company is unethical in terms of business operations and $CEO does not treat his employees with much respect.

------------------------------------------------------

**SA/Techsupport Frustration:**

Everything I've taken from the sysadmin subreddit, my education in school and personal research has been finding the best way to deploy IT projects and automate them. However, $CEO has always viewed IT in my opinion as a cost rather an investment. $CEO always wanted me to work around best practices and of course at no cost. Which, can be ok for the most part, just more work on my end to reach the end goals of redundancy and better workflow in terms of IT. The big issue here is $CEO doesn't listen. I have 3 years worth of emails to prove it, it always has to be his way. I'm not saying I'm the master or know better than $CEO. I've just done a ton of research, present it, nope, $CEO says it must be done with $0 dollars. It's incredibly frustrating and not having a Senior SA or anyone else with IT/SA/basic computer knowledge to back me up.

$CEO lacks respect for internal employees as well. Just overall does not treat all of us with politeness and lacks etiquette. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Unethical Business Practice:**

$CEO thought it was a good idea to have me jump on a ""project"" to do some QA testing. It's a order/sales software for some welding company. Figured, ""ok this will probably be easy."" Issues were tracked via Smartsheets. I went through and found that there were minimal explanations to some issues and updated them, replicated them in the program etc... However, some of the problems were fixed already. Also, some of the problems that were labeled as ""fixed"" were not working.


I suggested to $Supervisor that we move from Smartsheets to osTicket because the Smartsheet wasn't updated to reflect newest version of the program- It was not accurate and not dependable. So I asked about the process of how these issues get to the developers. 


$Supervisor explains~


**$Customer** and **$companyIworkfor** record issues into smartsheet, attach documents to smartsheet, see if it's enough information for $developers. Why can't the developers just look at it? Come to find out we contracted this job out to **$devcompany** in India and they have their own ticket tracking system. We were just middlemen. Strange, I thought we had our own developers. I asked $Supervisor why we can't hold a meeting with all the stakeholders of the project (devs, us, customer). 


> **$Supervisor:** ""It's too risky.""

> At this point I'm going ""wtf...."" and ask why. 

> **$Supervisor:** ""they don't know we contracted it out."" 

> I asked who the project-manager is for this project

> **$Supervisor:** ""They quit 2 years ago.""

> $Me: ""Wtf....""


Also, this project has been running for 2 years and $CEO already accepted a payment from the $Customer. I pushed and pushed and pushed for osTicket (it's free for fuck sakes) just so it makes it easier on my end to do QA and for everyone to submit issues and $CEO still says no. Other employees including $Supervisor agrees that the process needs to change.


> **$Me:** ""I'm not working on this project, I am sorry.""

> **$Supervisor:** ""That is perfectly ok, we understand.""


**$Supervisor** is a sweetheart and knew this was all new to me. However, I could have filled in the job with the right tools. That's only 50% of the way though. The other 50% that gets to me is how **$companyIworkfor** is hiding this from the customer, took 30 grand from them and the project is just now trying to be rushed to get done. I just smell shady business right there and I would feel awkward working on the project further.


It was kind of shocking and even more awkward telling someone ""no"" for the first time. I follow a strict but informal, ""System Admin's Code of Ethics."" In my opinion this line was violated by my organization and I would just violate it further by withholding the fact that we are not developing this software from the customer: 



*""I will lead by example, maintaining a high ethical standard and degree of professionalism in the performance of all my duties. I will support colleagues and co-workers in following this code of ethics.""* 



Small business world from what I have seen revolves around trusting partner companies and having really good relationships with your customers. That being said, having a good trust between clients and **$companyIworkfor** is probably one of the most important things. How could I possibly live up to this standard and be a professional when **$CEO** decides to not tell **$CustomerCompany** what is really going on and been upfront from the beginning? How could I possibly learn what the right way is when **$CEO** violates basic business ethics, cuts corners and runs off with 30k in the pocket when the project isn't done yet? Most importantly, I don't want to ruin my reputation in-case if word did happen to get out and here I am listed as a stakeholder and be ""guilty by association."" I wanted to protect my career in this case. 

So you know what /r/talesfromthejob? Fuck it. I'm leaving this company. **$CEO** never listens to any of the employees, **$CEO** wants his way, **$CEO** pulling shady stuff like this for a quick buck and doesn't care that a project hasn't been finished for two years. I know when I leave this company, they aren't going to hire a new SA. They can't afford it. They also can't afford someone not filling new IT project requests that need my assistance.  So I hope **$CEO** falls hard and fast. **$CEO** has it coming for themselves after disrespect towards employees and **$Customer**.

I am not returning to this company on Monday as I will be returning my keys to the building via envelope and removing my account from the domain. Not giving a two weeks, just a letter with my keyring.


**Tl;dr:** **$CEO is a butthole to employees. $CEO withholds from $Customer that $companyIworkfor is not actually developing the software and $devsfromIndia are. Project has ran for 2 years when it's a simple order/sales program, $CEO already accepted $30k payment for job, job still not done. Project manager quit 2 years ago. They were kind of pushing me into a project managing role but me not that kind of orc.**",2017-11-24 09:51:43

For anonymity, let’s call it Wirecorpp.The production floor manager was a huge pain and always getting in the way. Theres one instance that’s forever stuck in my mind.

I was given a job that required 1000 flat ribbon cables to be cut. Flat ribbon cables, for those not familiar, are cables were each wire is side by side. Instead of al wrapped up in a round cable, like an extension cord, they are aligned flat next to each other, like something you’d find in a computer. 

A special requirement of this cable was that, per customer specifications, we had to peel away two wires from the flat cable we were issued. There was no machine for this, so while the cable cutting machine was cutting the cable, you would have to stop the machine every 10-15 pieces to peel the spare wires back. The manager, very unfamiliar with the process, saw this, yelled at me for doing it that way, and attempted to find a faster way. He ended up tying the end of the spare wires to were the cable spool was. The following conversation occurred. I will be ME, production manager will be PM:
Me: Sir, that won’t work. The extra wires are gonna get pulled in. I’m gonna have to...
PM:It’s gonna work. Trust me. Just move back.Its gonna work. I’ve been working here 20 years(hasn’t worked on the production floor for the past ten). Just get back.

PM: Why did you let that happen?

At a certain local Home Owners Association's annual business meeting, in a neighborhood that's upscale with moderately-rich homeowners:

* The roads are privately maintained and need a few million dollars of maintenance
* Annual dues were $500
* The HOA Board of Directors proposed a $200 increase to $700/year to save up to pay for the roads
* The proposed increase was voted down by the membership
* Directors mention that this requires the dues to go to $100/year because of the way their agreement is written
* Cheers from the membership
* Director mentions this will not cover the neighborhood's bills
* Membership votes to keep $500
* Someone calls from the floor to remove a board member for proposing the increase to $700
* The board member is removed by a popular vote
* Someone else at the meeting realizes this is a thing that can be done, and proposes removing all the board members
* All the board board members are removed by popular vote
* There was a motion to adjourn the meeting immediately afterward
* The meeting was adjourned by popular vote

For about 6 of those years most of the supervisors and the CEO had worked there since the 60s so it had that old school banking atmosphere with an honest to God top shelf bar in the board room, and a hospitality room (that also included a top shelf bar and old guys who knew how to make real drinks for you) at the company party to get drunk before getting drunk.

Anyway two of my favorite people were the CEO, and a little old lady who was the Member Service Supervisor. 

The little old lady was a hoot. Once a month I would have to go to her office to re-train her on how email worked, and to clear out the 10,000 emails she didn't get to that month. She would make it through maybe 10 a day. And if you were lucky to be one of those 10, you got a hand written Post-It note on your keyboard for your reply.

She also liked to hit you if you were sarcastic or she thought you were funny. I learned that 75+ year old women can hit really hard.

The best was the CEO who had been used to having a secretary write his letters and such for years. Here are a few badly formatted stories, we will call him SJO:

1. Since we were located near a hospital we NEVER lost power. Until one day it happened. As my boss and I are frantically shutting down servers (IT is always underfunded for battery backup) he manages to get word to me via another poor soul and he says it's critical. I quickly head to his office where he is sitting in the dark behind his laptop. He proceeds to ask me why the internet was down. I stood dumbfounded for a minute then said the obvious thing ""The power is out."" He stares at me blankly then says ""But my laptop still works."" I then had to explain it had a battery in it. From the day he got the laptop to the day he retired, that laptop never left his desk.

2. He loved to page people using the phone system (so much we had to install a paging system when we moved to Shoretel IP phones) and would constantly do so. I was once in the process of programming our new Shoretel system when I get a page. Then another and another. I apologize to the vendor trying to train me and head down to his office. Inside I find half the BOD and him continuously clicking with his mouse. He looks up and says ""Oh it's good you're here. I can't get this webpage to load."" Then clicks reload a bunch more times. I come around and look and he had bookmarked a page inside his personal investment site and wasn't logged in so it wouldn't load. Took a 20 minute discussion to get him to understand why it didn't work.

3. Was helping a teller with a printer issue when I over heard him asking another teller how to play chess. She replied ""I don't know. Why don't you Google it?"" He mumbled something and headed to his office. Moments later over the intercom he pages me to his office. When I get there he asked me how to ""Google"" something.

4. Another time I get paged and give him a call back. He tells me he doesn't like the way his network cable runs to his laptop and wants me to move it right away. Looking for an excuse not to be at my desk I go down immediately with what I need to fix it. When I show up to his office he has his daughter visiting and tells me I didn't need to rush.

Overall it was really awesome to work there for the first 8 years. Then lots of management changed and the whole vibe changed. I had the best boss and mentor I've ever had the chance to work with, and meet lots of really genuine people while there. I got paid to take apart an electric stapler, dump out (aka take home) previously mentioned top shelf board room bar, unload a very large battery backup with 15 12v30ah batteries off a truck with no lift gate (""We thought you had a loading dock"") and many more fun and exciting things.",2017-10-17 08:57:23
The hazmat incident,61,76tn3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/76tn3z/the_hazmat_incident/,5,1508188053.0,"I once worked in a one story call center for a government agency. The call center was an old Kmart that the government had purchased and remodeled. We had a mail-room. Being a government agency, we received questionable items in the mail from time to time. The anthrax attacks were still fresh on all our minds.

One day, near the end of the day shift, we received a notice that everyone stay put when 5 0'clock comes. This was not unheard of as we often had to work a bit after the end of the shift to finish our calls. As I go about my business, there is commotion near the front of the building. I turn around, as my desk was facing the opposite end of the building, and see the security guard in a panic. He is frantic, pushing his way past management who, have seen something the rest of us haven't, gathered near the entrance. He shouts, ""EVERYONE GET THE FUCK OUT!"". As soon as he shouts this, people in [hazmat suits](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/11/22/3219E0D400000578-3488388-image-a-93_1457733865496.jpg) walk into the building.  I end the call I was on and begin to move toward the exit. A row of people in hazmat suits, some carrying weapons, others briefcases, make their way to the back of the call center. Toward the mail-room. My coworkers and I exit the building. Free to go home? Nope. Told to stay put, we cannot leave, go to our cars or go back into the building for any personal affects.

Unbeknownst to us, there was now an invisible perimeter around the building and parking lot. I am not sure what the security guard was thinking, but more than a few of us spied him get into his car. He steps on the gas, heading toward one of the exits, when a pair of unmarked cars appear, blocking his way. He turns the vehicle around and attempts the exit on the opposite side of the parking lot. Same result.

Herded in like cattle awaiting slaughter, told nothing, we stand there for three hours. I don't know the specific name for this operation, but a [decontamination tent](https://www.eugene-or.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=22867) is set up at the front of the building. There is a huge vehicle staged at the entrance. We see the hazmat team go in and out of the building. Some of my co-workers, management and those in the mail room, are escorted into the tent.

We are eventually told that there was reason to suspect delivery of a questionable powder to our mail-room. There was concern that the contents may have made its way through our ventilation system. It hadn't, thank goodness. The hazmat team was called in from a nearby military base to comb through the building. All in all, would do again, especially to hear the security guard freak out and attempt a daring escape. ",2017-10-17 00:07:33
Accused of stealing a teenager's gold chain,38,76oody,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/76oody/accused_of_stealing_a_teenagers_gold_chain/,2,1508135154.0,"Over the Summer I worked at an arcade near my house. It's the original location of a small chain. This arcade not only has arcade games, it also has mini golf, go-karts, and laser tag.

One time I was working, I was scheduled for the late laser tag shift. My duties included scheduling people's games, showing the players the rules, basic maintenance on vests and guns (like changing batteries, making sure the guns could shoot, and writing up vests and leaving them for the actual maintenance),supervising their games, and helping out in the actual arcade when there are no laser tag customers.

This specific day was incredibly slow, so I was behind the arcade's prize counter trying to help out in any way I could, while still keeping an eye on laser tag for customers. I noticed we needed a couple more stuffed animals and quickly ran into the back room, which is literally right behind to the prize counter, and grabbed a couple. I was in there for less than a minute. As I am coming out of the room someone tells me that some customers walked into one of the doors to laser tag.

There are two doors that lead to laser tag, one has a sign that says ""Do not enter"" and the other says ""wait for attendant"". I go into the one of the room, no one is there, I then enter the other room where I see a family of about 5, 4 teenagers and 1 mother. I tell them ""hey, I'm sorry but you cannot be in here without an attendant. If you come out with me and can set up a session for you now, but just so you know in the future you cannot enter here without an attendant."" The woman starts telling me they didn't see anyone, and saw the door and thought someone might be behind the door, the door clearly labeled to not enter. Keep in mind, they had probably waited for less than a minute before entering the door. I looked at her and said, ""there is a sign that says do not enter"". She then tried to argue with me about the sign not being visible (It 100% is, you literally have to look at the sign when opening the door.)

Finally I am able to talk them into leaving the room so I can actually take their tickets. I start their session and nothing much happens. When they leave I start to clean up a little, and hear a knock at the door. I go to the door and see one of the teenagers. He says that he lost his 2 gold chains. I tell him I will go look for them, and for him to wait out there (In hindsight, I should have told him to look with me, so the second part of this story wouldn't happen, but I had not thought about that until a couple hours later). 

I turn on the arena lights and look around, but am only able to find one of the chains and a safety pin, which they had used to clip the chains to their pants. I go back out to give them to the kid, by which time the mom was with him. She asks to go look, so I accompany her. We both look around for a little, and in the back of my mind I'm thinking maybe it got stuck somewhere that the arena lights cannot reach, but I can't go grab a flashlight since I cannot leave her there by herself. She keeps asking me where I found the first one, and I keep showing her exactly where it was. She then accuses me of stealing the second one, because they were clipped (with a tiny bent clip) together and the only way they were not found together was if I had taken one of them. 

I kept trying to assure her that I did not take it, but she would not listen to her. Finally, I tell her that I can get a missing item report and she can fill it out, and that if we find the item we will call her.

Right after that I go back into laser tag with a flashlight and start walking around. I find it in less than 5 mins, stuck in-between 2 barrels at the opposite end of the arena. I grabbed it and see that the woman is still in the arcade. I walked right up to her, and gave her the gold chain. She was speechless, and felt so bad about accusing me of stealing from her teenage child that she gave me $5.",2017-10-16 09:25:54

Boss: Well I don't have it. You really need to include me in ALL emails to clients going forward.

Me: Okay, I just checked and you definitely were included, but it looks like you sent the email from your @forwarded-to-main-account-email and not your @regular-email account so there might be a delay in when you get it because forwarded emails from other accounts dont update right away.. but I can manually do it for you.

Please listen to your gardener,62,74wv3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/74wv3z/please_listen_to_your_gardener/,4,1507403979.0,"So this happened a couple years ago. At the time, I'm an apprentice gardener with a property mainenance company, doing contract work on a big waterfront townhouse community. Twice weekly my supervisor and I would go there for routine landscape mainenance (yard work, hedge trimming, arbory).

Now for the tale- there is a guy at this waterfront complex who's been bugging us for a couple weeks about pruning a few feet from the top of a magnolia tree thats directly between his patio and the ocean. Every time he asked, my supervisor said the same thing; ""We can't prune this magnolia for you- it's not the kind of tree that will respond well to a heavy pruning.""

This guy had obviously been stewing on the unfair hand he had been dealt. He clearly didn't buy anything my supervisor had told him, and he had is heart set on improving his view. So when my supervisor and I arrive for work one day, he comes outside, threatening to do the pruning himself if we don't do it for him.

Now my supervisor has lost patience. He lays it out for this guy: ""I can't prune the magnolia. Heavy pruning will hurt the tree, ruin the shape of the canopy, and quite possibly trigger a vigorous response of new growth. If YOU decide to prune this tree, the property council may decide to bill you for damage."" The guy just grumbles and walks away without another word.

Fast forward to our next visit to the property- whattya know, the magnolia has about 1/3rd chopped right from the top. It's ruined- a beautiful, mature tree suddenly looks like someone flew through it while juggling chainsaws. We notify the propery council, but they do nothing to reprimand this guy. Now for sweet, yet frustrating, karma: fast forward again to the spring of next year, when the magniolias strart sending out new growth. This guys tree has EXPLODED with ugly, flimsy, unhealthy branches, all reaching straight up, back into his view, taller than before! *just like my supervisor had warned*. Justice was served. Yet now, the council has since requested that we remove these long ugly branches every year. So this guy literaly just shot himself in the foot, and the bullet ricochets into my foot.

TLDR; Guy wants us to prune a tree thats in his waterfront view, we tell him pruning will make things worse, he prunes it himself, ruins the tree and ends up with even less of a view. Now I have to trim that tree every year, when it was perfect the way it used to be.",2017-10-07 22:19:39

So, today, I was taking a call assisting someone that was confused about one of our newer products when I hear this from in the background:

**""OH MY F###### GOD! I AM SO PI##ED OFF ABOUT HAVING TO WORK ALL THIS F###### OVERTIME!""**

I quickly and calmly ask the agent who or what was that and was informed this person does this a lot. I sent a lovely email along with a time stamp to that centres' management team along with a timestamp of the call. They listened to it and he was written up right away.

This woman seems to think I am her go to solution if we are a few heads short, as recently I have been waking up in the morning after rest nights to find the several missed calls from her, no voicemails. Annoyingly she seems to call just before shift stars or after shift has started, at which point I am in bed...with my phone on silent and I've usually had alcohol. I think she pesters me mostly because she knows I have a car and can get here pretty quickly. But hasn't said anything about these calls.

And now? She's taken the fucking cake. A mere 2 hours after finishing work and starting what is meant to be 2 rest days in a row. I get a text stating I am in work tonight. Confused, I text back stating I am meant to be on rest tonight (I check the rota before I leave cause she has a rep for changing it and forgetting to tell us) and ask did she text me by mistake?

An hour later I finally get a reply, well 3 repiles.

""Sorry you are in tonight""

""We need you hun."" <--- Don't fucking try to sweet talk me

""Rota changed"" <---- AKA. Oh no. You've realised I am trying to get you in on a rest day, let's fuck with the rota, so you have to come in.

This just pisses me off! It's rare I get 2 rest days in a row and I had made plans to get shit that needs to be done, DONE! This makes me miss my manager at the charity shop I volunteered at, never demanded that I come in, instead would call and politely ask if I could cover so and so. And I'd agree to, since 1) she asked politely 2) wouldn't get miffed if had to turn her down 3) would be properly grateful. POC on the other hand? Demands.

At least when she was on holiday and had someone covering for her, that guy wouldn't just change it. He'd either text/call you at a reasonable time or approach you during work hours and ask nicely ""Is it possible for you to do this day? So and so can't do that shift/since we're shorthanded.""

As such I sent back a text, making it very clear I have commitments to see to that I can not back out of. Most likely gonna get shit when I am next in, but I'm already dusting off the CV, this along with the fact I cannot access my payslips has made me consider finding somewhere else with a more solid rota and with more capable POC",2017-09-25 23:29:52
Caught between a pushy pregnant lady and my manager,85,710ihk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/710ihk/caught_between_a_pushy_pregnant_lady_and_my/,2,1505794022.0,"TL:DR at bottom.

This was back when I was working as a receptionist for a small satellite location of a well-known tax service. It was a *very* small location - one storefront in a strip mall; basically the front desk (where I was) with a row of chairs in front with a table offering coffee/water as the reception area, just behind that a long hallway with a single row of cubicles, leading to a small back break/file room with our only bathroom. This back room wasn't generally a public area, but we allowed customers to use the bathroom on request. My manager, in the first cubicle of the line (directly behind the reception desk) was also the highest qualified person in the office - she was the only one that knew how to handle the rare *really* complicated stuff. 

We had this one client who was about 8 months pregnant and very scatterbrained - she had to keep making new appointments because she kept coming in without all the documents we needed (despite being given a list every single time). Unfortunately, she was apparently also an exceptionally complicated case and could only meet with the manager. The very busy, usually totally-booked-up manager.

Eventually this pregnant lady was leaving from maybe her 3rd appointment - a new copy of the list we'd sent her home with every single time (and would remind her about before she came in) in her possession. Protocol would be for me to schedule her a new appointment to come in with her completed documents, but she was clearly in a Mood and refused to make a new appointment, saying she'd call when she decided to come back. I reminded her that the manager would not have an open appointment for the next 2 days and it was best to reserve her time slot now, but the lady was having none of it and stormed out.

Later that same day, pregnant lady storms back in, triumphantly announcing that she has all her paperwork *this* time. I explain that, unfortunately, Manager is all booked up for the rest of the day and tomorrow, but will be happy to schedule an appointment for a time after that. Pregnant lady gets huffy and asks if there is any way she can be squeezed in today (right now). I try to decline again but she won't take ""no"" for an answer, so I paste on my best Customer Service Smile and say I'll check. (Sometimes we would let stubborn people do this - if they ignored multiple warnings, we'd let them wait until they got frustrated and get them to make an appointment on their way out like we offered in the first place.)

I walked around to the first cubicle (my manager's) to find it empty, so I went back to the break/file room to tell my manager the situation, who was pulling some files and told me there was no squeezing Pregnant Lady in but to let her wait if she won't listen. 

Now, as I said, the office is very small, so you can see all the way down the hall from reception - it is very clear whether you pop into a cubicle along the way or turn the corner around the back. Pregnant Lady saw me go around back to confirm with my manager and knew where the bathroom was because she'd been there before. After about 5 minutes of waiting, Pregnant Lady asks to use the facilities. She's far enough along that no one in their right mind would deny her bathroom access, so I let her go.

Turns out my manager wasn't just pulling files, but had decided to go on her lunch break. After a few more minutes I realize Pregnant Lady hasn't come back from the bathroom. I head to the back and around the corner to find her badgering Manager, who is trying (very patiently) to explain that there is no way they can have another meeting today. Then Pregnant Lady has the utter gall to say: ""You're not seeing anyone *right now* though!"" This, as my manager is standing by the break room table, lunch spread out in front of her, fork in her hand.

We eventually got Pregnant Lady to make a new appointment and leave, but my boss did demand an explanation as to why the lady was even allowed into the back in that situation. (She accepted my reasoning, but it was still a terrifying conversation.)

**TL:DR** - Pregnant lady storms out without making a new appointment; returns same day expecting to be seen despite the busy schedule. When refused, asks to use the bathroom (and is allowed because she's so heavily pregnant), really using the opportunity to get access to the break room to harass the manager, who gets angry at me (receptionist) for failing my gate-keeping duties.",2017-09-19 07:07:02

"This is what happens when you follow corporate policy purely because it's there, without applying critical thinking. Or, my boss wants to fire someone over a bottle of Windex.",207,6xmmt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6xmmt2/this_is_what_happens_when_you_follow_corporate/,17,1504365914.0,"So a few months ago, I needed some quick cash for Reasons, so I got a night job as a janitor.  It's easy work, the pay's good, and it doesn't conflict with my day job.

My new employer has a dumb rule.  Employees are not allowed to buy any supplies, tools, or equipment, for ANY reason.  Every single purchase of literally everything has to go through the corporation's purchasing department.  Doesn't matter whether it's a $xx,xxx server or a $4 bottle of Windex, you have to requisition it, and they order it.

Actually I lied.  YOU don't requisition it.  You have to report to your manager that you need something, and the manager has to requisition it.  I asked why all the red tape and got some BS answer about liability.  I've long since learned not to question authority if I get paid the same either way.  So I went about my business.

Talking of Windex, I used up all the Windex after a few weeks.  So I asked my manager for more.

The next week, it hadn't come in.  So I reminded him about it.  He said he forgot to fill out the requisition, but he'd do it as soon as he could.

The week after, still no Windex.  I reminded him again.  I got a lecture about how he's a busy man and he doesn't have time to just drop everything and requisition a $4 bottle of window cleaner.  I offered to go to the store and buy it myself, because fuck, it's just $4.

He looks me dead in the eye and asks if I'm trying to get fired.

I ALMOST got into an argument with him about how ridiculous it is that he won't order it and won't let me buy it even if I pay for it myself AND I can't do my job without it but I still get paid, but then I remember that I still get paid.  So I say something like, ""No sir, I'm sure we can wait a little longer.""

And everything is fine for a bit, but eventually the mirrors and windows start to get dirty, and people started complaining that I suck at cleaning windows.  I tried to clean them with regular water, but that didn't really improve things.

So I got an idea.

An awful idea.

I had a wonderful awful idea.

I went to the store and bought a bottle of Windex, I put it in the lunch box I bring every night, and I oh so casually walked in to work that night.

And after a couple of hours, all the glass in the facility had never been so clean.

But I had to make it look like I hadn't directly disobeyed company policy AND my boss, so when I ran into my boss later, I said, ""hey, thanks for ordering the Windex.  I appreciate it.""

His reaction was along the lines of what I would expect if I'd said, ""hey, thanks for ordering the hardcore porn magazines for me to read instead of doing my job.  I appreciate it.""  But my plan worked.  It wasn't me he was angry with.  It was whoever had the audacity to bring a bottle of Windex into the facility.  He demanded to know who it was.

""Geez, I got no idea,"" I said, sounding confused.  ""I thought it was you.  But I guess it could have been anyone.  People have been complaining that I haven't been keeping the windows clean. ""

And my boss decided to make it his mission to find out who.

I work as a gardener, me and my co-worker generally work for old ladies and the like, people who can't take care of their own gardens anymore.

One day we arrived at *Old Mans* house, normally the first thing we do is check to see if anything special needs doing before we start our usual routine. This is where the speech began.

* It started with how my Co-worker (who lives less than a mile away from this guy) has more sand in the soil around his house.
* This leads to an extended section about land ownership, about how the guy who used to own the field behind my co-workers place, didn't actually own it because of Mineral rights or something. (Someone else owns the field now, so it didn't really matter anyway)
* After learning about the ownership of the field, we were reminded of how it was hit by a bomb in WW2 (I've seen the crater, it's cool)
* Then we were back to the soil quality again, and most importantly, the point of this exchange.

He wanted us to dig a deeper trench to plant his beans in, the one we dug the week before was too shallow apparently.

Why couldn't you just tell us that?",2017-08-23 19:23:06
A lady got mad because I wouldn't allow her to commit fraud,145,6tqniw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6tqniw/a_lady_got_mad_because_i_wouldnt_allow_her_to/,11,1502756329.0,"I'm a bank teller, and usually things go pretty well with customers. I've worked a wide array of customer service jobs, from Walmart to a movie theater to taking sales calls for HSN. Working at a bank is probably the best so far, because people are less likely to be jerks to you when it comes to their money. Usually.

This past Saturday, I had a lady write a check from her business account. She wrote the check right in front of me. When I took it from her to cash then deposit it, as she requested so they'd get the funds right away, I glanced at it and felt my heart sink. She was already back from a previous transaction which wasn't done the way she wanted, so I knew she was the type that was going to be snotty about any little thing that didn't go her way.

The check was made out to her business's co-owner, a guy, and... she had signed the back. In his name.

When I refused to take it, and gave her another option that would have saved her from writing/wasting another check, she got huffy and said it *had* to be written to the guy for business reasons. Okay, so, he has to sign it. Otherwise it's fraud. Even if he approves, if it's not his signature, he could come back later and say he didn't sign it and I'm the one on the hook. Regardless, it's fraud, and I'm not doing it.

Mad now, the lady ""threateningly"" said she could go get him, but he wouldn't be happy. I just gave her my best customer service smile and said, ""Okay!"" and turned around to go back to my station until I could actually help her.

The funny thing is, the guy didn't seem phased when they came back in. He signed the check, I did their transaction, and that was it. Except the lady paused before leaving, staring at me like she expected an apology. Again with the stupid, fake grin, I thanked her, and walked away.",2017-08-15 03:18:49

She constantly needs validation, because none of her ideas are her own- she imitates everyone. If I fall down skateboarding & call in sick from the ER with a broken wrist, she’ll tell people “I think I’m coming down with what metooeither has!” A supervisor has cancer. Yup. Suddenly ‘Jennifer’ is posting on social media “My stomach hurts, I bet it’s cancer. Pray for me, I’m going to Urgent Care. *weeping emoticon*”. Someone was fired recently for exposing himself to customers. Suddenly Jennifer is dressing sluttier and moving in such a way that her shirt keeps exposing her. 

We all ignore her, because although she’s in her 40’s, she has the mentality of a 13 YO. She follows us around while we are working, and if we don’t drop what we are doing to talk to her, she’ll yell at us from across the store later in that shift. 

She’s also racist. She learned the hard way not to complain about certain minority groups openly when one of our coworkers told her “my husband, who is that race would disagree with you”. 
 
Nepotism got her the position, so we have to pretend we like her, and that we are riveted by her drama- or else “we all hate her” or “we are out to get her”. We have to cater to her, take her litters of puppies, buy her multi level marketing crap, all but bring her her dry cleaning or it’ll show up on our next review that we ‘don’t get along with our co workers.’  

Punch line. She claims she’s shy and has too much anxiety to interact with anyone of us, yet she can complain about even made up infractions when she feels she isn’t getting enough attention.

APOPLEPTIC!,13,6syxft,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6syxft/apopleptic/,1,1502426547.0,"I haven't had the brain bandwidth to write up the next Closed Area Tales thing, due to the impending (I hope) end of grad school, so here's a tidbit.

For a short time before I left Wasteland (check the previous posts I've submitted here for background), I was moved to a different part of the project, and as a result, ended up transferred to an office outside the closed area. This was a cubicle in a largish room, with actual closed offices off to the side. The people in these offices usually kept their doors open.

On the one hand, I could go pee after 5 o'clock without having to bother with the lab's combination lock, and the wonky lab door was no longer my problem. On the other, the office dwellers were also overly fond of their speakerphones. *Even when they were talking to each other!* Often, I'd hear both sides of conversation, with an echo from both due to the speakerphone. Seriously, guys, you're twenty feet from each other. Get up and walk.

But, this also meant you could hear lots of interesting gossip. One guy in particular had an especially loud voice, and once I was privy to a heated conversation he had with someone in another office. They were having some argument over a policy decision, and he was apoplectic. **A-PO-PLEP-TIC!**

'Cuz he'd been doing this for **eleventy-bajillion years** and knows this contract **better than anyone** and don't ask him for any help after this! Just **don't!** Because he'll go all **apopleptic** on your ass, and he won't even help you! He doesn't need this! He knows **better!** You're on your own after this! He's **apoplectic** about this, you hear?

But of course, that wasn't the end of it. A couple of hours later, I got to listen to him again, making several phonecalls apologizing about getting apopleptic.	",2017-08-11 07:42:27

Recently she had been promised a pay raise with the job promotion of Reception Supervisor. Her manager said, just wait. I gotta get it okayed with my dad.

Boss's son knows how much Daddy likes this woman. So he says she's going to be Reception Supervisor. ""They need someone from outside to make changes. Business 101."" 

Boss's son tells my friend she's going to be training Molly. Friend asks if Molly is going to be manager. He says no.

Don't like being told you can't cut the line? Complain until you get a pass that lets you!,90,6ryxec,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6ryxec/dont_like_being_told_you_cant_cut_the_line/,7,1502033160.0,"I work at an amusement park where I run one of the roller coasters. Yesterday was rainy and cold, which usually means the park will be dead. However, it was also a Saturday so the park was fuller than I've ever seen it. More guests means more crazy people, of course.

Halfway through the day, my coworker sees two little girls cut about twenty minutes worth of line. When they get into our station, she tells them that they cannot cut the line and will not be permitted to ride. They don't move or show any sign that they heard her. When they get to the front of the line, my coworker says that they have to cross through the train to the exit because they cut the line and she told them before that they couldn't ride. 

The girls didn't actually say anything the whole time, but their mom went off on my coworker. She was furious that her daughters couldn't just cut a ton of people in line. Her reasoning was that the line was so ridiculously long that they had to go to the bathroom so they got out of line. 

Our line was about an hour long for most of yesterday. Lots of people came up to the front having to go to the bathroom and we would let them go and come back up the exit because that is way easier than having to clean up pee (or poop, as we had to do last night). Even more people leave the line and come back at the end. I'm assuming the majority go before they get in line. 

This lady, as all angry people seem to, wanted to speak to someone higher up. So my team leader came to talk to her. After a few minutes of being told that her daughters couldn't cut the line, she wanted someone even higher up. My supervisor happened to be coming up to check our evening paperwork so we had her talk to the angry guest. My supervisor told her that it was our job to enforce park and ride policies and that we did nothing wrong. We couldn't run the next cycle until they were outside the exit, so they went and talked out there for a long time before walking off somewhere together. We were fools to think it was over. 

An hour later she shows up at our exit with an exit pass. Exit passes let you go to the exit of a ride and skip the line entirely. One use only. There's a few ways to get them, but you can always tell where a guest got one from the signature on it and gets came from high on the park totem pole. She got rewarded because her kids cut the line. 

When a guest has one of these, we have to take it and give it to our supervisor at the end of the night. 
This is so guests don't reuse them, don't try to reproduce them, and so we know how many are given out each day and where they are used. 

When she comes up I ask how many are in her group and where they want to sit. She tells me and I take the pass. She asks if she's getting it back and I tell her I have to take it to the operator booth. She asks if she gets it back after and I say no, it's one use only. She gets mad and says she can use it as many times as she wants. I show her on the pass the places where it says one use only, but she's insistent that she was told she could use it as many times as she wants. 

The operator called our supervisor who said it was indeed one use only and we relayed that to her. She demanded a supervisor so we called for one. When he showed up he talked to her for a while, made a long phone call, and told her what we did. She eventually left and didn't come back. After all that I asked if I could put in another two weeks notice because I really felt like I needed to quit twice. ",2017-08-06 18:26:00

I worked at my college's fieldhouse, where I had worked my way up the ladder and was essentially assistant manager during the school year and manager during the summer (boss is women's basketball coach so he was busy with recruiting and setting up camps, as well as relaxing so he turned the building over to me). My last two summers I had a coworker we'll call R. R was a sorority girl who last summer lived with a few of her sisters in a house near campus. These are a few stories from working with her. 
 
*One night I received a text from her asking if we could switch shifts and I could come in at 8 so she could sleep off her hangover. I said yes only because it was 1 in the morning and I wasn't sure who would answer their phone to cover for her. I tell her this is the last time and she says ""well I thought we were friends and could do this sort of thing but whatever, thanks."" No, you cannot take advantage of me like that each time you decide to go drinking. 
 
*We host a large Christian conference for high schoolers each summer, and are asked to unlock the doors before each show to help out. They have workers stand by the doors and check wristbands (1000 students and parents show up for each week it happens, they check to make sure everyone's a part of the conference), so they cannot be expected to open the doors, hold them, and be able to check everyone in at the same time and catch everyone. I'm out getting groceries and receive a call and a text from two different people informing me that the doors weren't unlocked and the conference people were mad. I tell them I'm on it, and when I get to work and ask what happened she said she heard kids so she went to check and asked how they got in. They said the doors were unlocked so she went back to the desk without checking. Then she proceeded to get mad when I said I had to let our boss know because he was most likely going to receive a call about it. 
 
*She told me once she needed to leave at 4 for a Dr's appointment, then told the guy she was working with that I gave her the OK to leave at 3. She left at 2:30.
 
*She would ask for a sub two hours before needing to leave because a sorority sister was spending her last night in town and they were having a party for her. The schedule was set in April, you know when you work. We all made the decision to never help her when we got that text.

"Sometimes you decide to really try, and the customer still gets screwed",8,6qdxdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6qdxdy/sometimes_you_decide_to_really_try_and_the/,2,1501367858.0,"This just happened today. I work at a dealership in the service department as a service advisor. I had a customer having engine troubles. He was from out of town, as many of our customers are since we are in the middle of nowhere, so we had ordered parts for him ahead of time, suspecting (correctly) what his issue was.

The problem was not with this particular customer - he was swell, very understanding; perhaps more so than I would've been in the same situation. The part that we had ordered was an aftermarket piece, which usually works fine, but occasionally you run into hiccups that are out of our control. This was the case today.

No matter how hard my technician tried, this part would not fit. He tried for *hours*, and as a flat rate technician, he tried well past when he could've given up, even though it'll ~~likely~~ definitely hurt his pay. We ended up needing to order the part from the OEM manufacturer, but that means it takes at least two days to get here - further slowed down by the weekend. This customer is from approximately six hours away; he came in for business, and then his vehicle started acting up. He's stuck here.

I immediately went into apology-mode. I explained as openly and honestly as I could what had happened with the part, the technician came and showed him the piece, and I involved the only manager on duty today, who also happened to be high up the food chain.

My manager spoke with the customer, and mentioned perhaps an arrangement for a rental car or a fix on the bill. The customer was a little disappointed with his vehicle, but facing hotel and food costs, he wanted to follow up with the manager on his offer. I took him back to see the manager, hoping we could find something to make him happy.

Coming back to my manager, he now said that car troubles are a risk of owning a car, and that they have no control over defects in parts or discrepancies between manufacturers (which is true). However, just ten minutes prior, I had a lot more hope we'd be able to even minutely help this customer - even a free rental car would allow him to drive home and come back when his car was ready, for much cheaper than a hotel. I thought that was the least we could do, but since it wasn't my decision, I let my manager disappoint my customer.

I foresaw trouble today and prepared accordingly, and met with a wonderful customer who, in the face of trouble, was very tolerant and never rude. I apologized again and again, and blatantly told him I thought my manager intended to do more but it was above my pay grade, and he said he understood and he would come back when the vehicle was ready.

It was just so embarrassing, on our company's part, in my opinion. I shared a similar story with one of my coworkers, who likewise had an older customer once, from out of town, who didn't have much money to come in and go home and come back again. My coworker even offered to help pay for the customer's rental car, but he was told not to.

In my years of customer service, I would say 99% of my time is spent between miserable people and problem-free people. This was the first time I experienced this sort of problem, and it was absolutely heartbreaking to imagine myself in the same predicament.

My coworker and I are both in our 20s, and we're some of the youngest of the crew here. I'm beginning to wonder if this demonstrates a little bit of the paradigm shift in society today about customer service. In all honesty, I view this customer as a potential for coming back as any, since most of our customers don't live here. If he travels for work, maybe he'd think of us next time he's through for an oil change, even? Considering we'd have to write off literally hours of pay for the technician anyway, the rental car would cost barely anything in comparison for a couple days. The customer would still be paying for fuel.

Putting an end to the lengthy rant, but... Just disappointed in my management today. I really wanted to help the customer.",2017-07-30 01:37:38

The past five or so of my shifts (probably few weeks, wouldn't be surprised if this happens on my days off), the last person to leave is always the same. He starts showering five minutes before we close, and begins putting his clothes on five minutes after we close. He meticulously puts on each piece of clothing and usually leaves around 15-20 after.
 
Tonight he does the same thing. It's about 15 after, and as he's beginning to walk out the MOD walks in to see how many people are left. The following conversation occurs. 
 
MOD: *looks at wrist like he's checking time* where do you work? 
Guy: *laughing* why do you wanna know? 
MOD: oh, just so I can come to your work and stay ten minutes after you guys close. 
Guy: well you guys get paid the longer I'm here, so I don't see a problem. 
 
I couldn't hear the rest of the conversation too well, but MOD essentially said that that doesn't matter, when we close you need to be leaving or close to leaving. I've had many people apologize to me when they're running late and I joke and say ""the longer you're here, the more I get paid."" However, I say that only to people who are packing up their bags and almost done.

Conversationally I'll be ""Me,"" and the new hire will be ""NH.""

This one took place a couple of months later. The steakhouse was doing great business, the brothers were keeping everything clean (*they even kept the accent lighting bulbs up in the rafters changed out regularly!*), and we had started planning on longer hours (*going from just dinner service to lunch and dinner service*).

Of course, with longer hours we needed more staff. So out with the big stack of applications!

Found a few decent candidates, scheduled interviews, etc. One new hire, though, was a bit...well...

Her interview went decently, nothing spectacular, no crayon on her application, decent references (*2 personal, 1 a former employer*), she was well dressed (*office casual, bit much for restaurant work*), and she was actually on time!

Now for the employee uniform, we provided the tops (*black polo shirts embroidered with their name over the left breast, restaurant logo on the right shoulder*), and the employees provided black jeans and black skid safe shoes.

The shirts would take about 2 weeks to arrive (*custom embroidery*), so until then, we would give the new employees 3 branded black tee shirts, and a pin-on name tag.

So I'm helping out in the prep room in the back when our hostess called me on the radio, asking me to come to her station because the new hire was here, and we ""may have an issue.""

I made my way up front, and when I got there, I saw exactly what the ""issue"" was, and my jaw hit the floor.

> NH: ""I'm here, and ready to start making money!"" (*said with a ""flirty"" shake, and EVERYTHING shook*)

The hostess was standing behind NH, hand over her mouth, trying to not laugh.

> Me: ""What in the hell are you wearing? You can't seriously expect to work like that!""

She had her hair teased out in ""wings"" (*very 80's porn-look*), more makeup than Tammy Faye Bakker, 6-inch stilleto boots, one of the tee-shirts I had given her cut to shreds (*[like this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/04/9b/76/049b765c5ed7029e7b4a02481e2ccc22--cutting-shirts-cut-up-shirts.jpg)*), across the lower front and and entire back, and black jeans cut up both sides and safety-pinned back together, showing far too much skin overall (*it was VERY clear she wasn't wearing a bra or underwear*).

> NH: ""What? I jazzed my outfit up a bit so I could earn more tips! Don't you like it?"" 

She did the ""cutesy"" spin and bend over, showing me ""the whole outfit.""

What I wanted to do: Tell her to get the hell out of my restaurant and get back on her street corner.

What I did: 

> Me: ""We need to go back to the office **NOW!** and hurried her back to the office before any customers could see her.

Just so happened one of the owners was there, in the office.

Oh, quite the conversation ensued! 

She simply couldn't understand why we didn't like her outfit, because it was sure to ""bring in more tips"" for her, and ""more business for the bar.""

Yes, the restaurant has a bar in it. With a fully trained and licensed bartender, who wore our standard uniform. (*NH was being hired as a regular server, btw, not a bartender*). Had NH ever worked a bar before? 

> NH: ""Well not serving drinks, no... But I worked on the stage in a bar, doesn't that count?""

(*That wasn't on her application. Her old employer was listed as a pizza place across town.*)

The term ""FAMILY restaurant"" made no sense to her at all, so finally I told her flat out:

> Me: ""Go home, dress reasonably like all our other staff here, and we'll let you try again tomorrow.""

2 weeks later, she showed up, wearing a ratty looking ""belly shirt"" and ""painted on"" jeans, wanting to pick up her ""paycheck"" (*she'd never actually clocked in, and had never started work, so WTF paycheck?*) and drop off her tee-shirts (*yes, she had shredded all three, no we didn't bill her for them, sadly*).

That ended with the hostess telling her to get out of the restaurant before we ""call the cops on her for solicitation,"" and we never saw her again.

So yes, dress for the job you want, but at least be aware of where you're working!",2017-07-27 02:35:06
You don't like losing money? Then learn to listen.,81,6pi7f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6pi7f2/you_dont_like_losing_money_then_learn_to_listen/,2,1501007985.0,"Greetings. First post in this subreddit, I do sincerely hope it fits, sorry in advance if it does not.

I'm developer specialized in bigdata, image processing, GIS; usually having my expertise marketed as an ""undertaker"". I join dying projects and try to revive them, or at least bury them leaving as much profit to the customer company as I can.

But I wasn't always a developer. When I first graduated, foreign export/import was an incredible market. During those times having fluent English and some basic info about import/export was pretty profitable. I confess, I also had my fill with middle/upper manglement during my part-time years in college so doing the import/export in a suit and not staring at a computer screen for ten hours straight in a basement floor somewhere looked great to me. So I started working as a free agent, offering translation, import/export know-how and also IT/development/web design support in my home city as a free agent.

Of course I gave up, because a customer is... a customer. A customer is never right and true happiness lies in the path of developing with the least contact to other human beings. I needed experience to learn this simple fact.

Just a few moments ago I was telling a friend about my import/export adventure so I decided to share one prominent story here. It'll be quick in greentext. I'll call myself $me because all cool kids call themselves $me and the customer will be called ~~utter moron~~upper management, $UM for short...

>**$UM**: Zztri, we'd like to join $veryLargeAndSeriousB2BNetwork. Can you arrange that?

>**$me**: That's great. It's time you expanded horizons to e-biz. But they're rather serious and have some tedious joining procedure to avoid scammers. I'll check and get back.

*I check with the customer service of $veryLargeAndSeriousB2BNetwork and learn the prerequisites, how they'll declare we're a real business.*

>**$me**: You need all your trademarks patented. You need to have your company name registered in the chamber of commerce. They'll also check your records in the tax department and you need to have declared positive tax for at least last tax season. The accounting must send formal documentation about the tax when they request. Are we all clear about these?

>**$UM**: Sure, we're a real company, aren't you aware, Zztri?

>**$me**: Yeah sure, I was only worried about the ""at least one year with positive declared tax"" portion, being a new company and all..

>**$UM**: Then we can apply?

>**$me**: Yeah sure, we also have to pay x amount as a fee. I'll send the requirements, fee and the deposit account info as a mail to accounting.

*About 15 days pass. They receive in mail - actual, paper mail, it was years ago - that they're rejected because there doesn't seem to be a company registered for the name $theirFriggingNameWrittenOnEverything in either the chamber of commerce or tax department.*

>**$UM**: What the frick, Zztri?! You said we'd just send the fee!

>**$me**: There must be a mistake! How can you be not registered to the chamber of commerce or tax department? I advise you to go visit the local offices right away and get formal papers proving that you're registered.

>**$UM**: Uhm...

>**$me**: *???*

>**$UM**: We're registered as $similarButDifferentName.

>**$me**: .... Why?

>**$UM**: It was my brother's company. When he went bankrupt, we started using that name and took over his existing customers. Our formal documentation is on $similarButDifferentName but we use the name $name in everywhere else.

>**$me**: Then why did you agree when I told you the conditions?!

>**$UM**: You didn't tell us about those conditions at all.

>**$me**: I did. I even sent a mail about the requisites to the accounting!

*We head over to accounting. $PNC; poor number cruncher enters the story here.*

>**$me**: $PNC, did you receive a mail about joining requirements to $B2BNetwork from me a couple weeks ago? Why didn't you warn me about you being registered in another name?

*$PNC stares at us like a deer caught in headlights for a few moments, then stares at $UM.*

>**$PNC**: Because $UM said they're just formality and we're good.

*I'm not a calm person. I should say I'm actually very aggressive. So I did what would stop me from headbutting people all around.*

>**$me**: I'm going now.

>**$UM**: Uhm.. Zztri? When will they return the registration fee?

>**$me**: They won't. You don't like losing money? Then learn to listen.

Hope I could give you at least a weak chortle.",2017-07-25 21:39:45
8 Hours of Crap,34,6p61uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6p61uo/8_hours_of_crap/,4,1500869040.0,"Before anyone reads this and decides to post ""grow up ya wimp"", here's some food for thought. 
a) I'm fresh out of college and trying to make ends meet.
b)  my job in college wasn't janitorial or anything like the things I do during my shifts here. 
c)  half of the reason I couldn't handle today is because of stuff at home. 
 
Now that that's done.....

I get a call from the front desk saying one of our personal trainers found something in the parking lot and needs us to check it out. As he's walking with me out there, he tells me that the car next to him has needles under it and he's afraid a child will find them or the passenger in the car next to it will step on them. I'm thinking your stereotypical hospital needles with the long needles and short plungers. NOPE. We get there, and there are five epipens (or at least that's what they look like) laying under the driver's door. So I run back inside, grab my broom and dust bin, and sweep those bad boys up. Problem is, my biohazard bin (don't have sharps containers at my job) hasn't been changed in the two months since I've been there and is filled to the top, and I've never been shown where the bags are so that has to be put on hold until I find the MOD. I go on lunch (30 minutes on Sundays so I have to clock out) and find her afterward (needles were hidden from view so nobody could get hurt). We run around and finally find the bags, so I replace mine and dump the needles in a separate one before running the trash out. I continue on with my day, only to realize that, with an hour left, I NEVER CLOCKED BACK IN. To top it off, when I checked the boy's shower I found roughly 3/4 of a stack of towels just laying in there soaked. A stack is about 20, so you can imagine how difficult it was for me to put them into an already full basket and drag that out to our dirty towel bin. I know the kids who probably did it too, but there's sadly nothing I can do as for some reason management lifted the rule saying you can only take one or two.

I had a BIG stack of applications to go through. A few stand out as being memorable, like the guy who listed his fellow inmates and his parole officer as references (I was willing to give him a shot, but he missed his interview by being arrested and in jail again), or the woman who had ""tons of experience"" listing her last 5 restaurants where she'd worked a total of 2 weeks.

But the one that really caught my attention was the application written in red crayon. Yes, seriously. Neat printing throughout, but completely done in red crayon. I called this guy in for an interview just for the hell of it.

When he showed up he was well dressed (*polo shirt, black jeans, comfortable non-skid shoes*), had excellent references, a decent work history, good knowledge of restaurant work (*dish pit, bussing, and prep*), and overall, was perfect for the job.

Finally, at the end of the interview (*I'd already decided to hire him. I'd be insane not to!*), I asked the big question: ""Why did you fill out the application in red crayon?""

""Well, I figured you'd have a ton of applications to dig through, so I wanted to stand out.""

After his second day on the job, I jokingly told him ""You're the best worker we've got! Any more like you at home?""

""Well, I've got a brother who could use a job.""

He brought his brother in the next day for a trial run. Hired him on the spot, too. The brothers were still working there when I left 4 years later, and they took over my position as co-GMs.",2017-07-20 16:26:36

They made soap and candles in a bigass warehouse out in the country.  The factory fell on hard times and at one point they felt a need to put up a sign inside that said

>Any employee caught in the parking lot during working hours will be subject to immediate termination

which may have been related to the large pile of empty beer bottles behind the fence along the parking lot.  The company finally closed and the soap factory stood abandoned.  But this is all by the way. 

The soap company phones were on a a POTS system with lots of wires running to terminal strips in an electrical room.  Very obviously phone-system-looking.  When we bought the place and moved in, it was more effort than it was worth to remove, so we left the remnants of the old phone system and went right to IP telephony.  The time-clock system is also IP-based.  Video cameras were installed, as was a security alarm (IP-based as well).  And bars on the windows.

Fast forward and my company had a few hundred-thousand dollars worth of computers and spares laying around in the warehouse, and a pair of *clowns* broke in.  The alarm went off of course and this sent them into a panic.  They (literally) ran around cutting every cable that looked like it could be telephone-related to try to kill the alarm.  This included the time clock's keyboard (a USB tenkey keyboard) and most of the old phone system's wiring.  The alarm continued blaring, and they continued running.  The storage area of the warehouse has locked gates and they couldn't get in to get any goodies.   They attempted to flee out one of the windows, but only managed to break it and then (shockingly) they couldn't get the bars off, so they ran out the door where they came in, and off into the night.  Some laughs were had when the security video was reviewed the next day.

The time clock keyboard cable was previously draped in ugly fashion along the wall, so after I was done repairing it, the only part of the company that they damaged that anyone ever sees actually looked better.  

tl;dr: burglary fail involving cutting of wires that did nothing.",2017-07-20 06:50:58

Every now and again when I would talk to this guy I would bring up some sort of funny website that he could check out himself or share with his wife and son to have a laugh.

Gizoogle, the gangster search engine was a hit: http://gizoogle.net/

Elgoog, the mirrored search engine was even better: http://elgoog.im/

Eventually I heard him ranting about someone who was either less tech-savy than him, or just plain lazy. The guy was constantly sending emails asking basic questions that he should be able to figure out himself in a few seconds. My friend was quite busy and could easily take more than an hour to get to an email so these little requests were causing big delays.

The straw that broke the camel's back was the guy asking for our address. The street address was displayed prominently on our homepage, with additional details on the contact us page, and in the side bars of various other pages. Our site was also the top google search result so even though the guy should have the address on file since he'd dealt with us before, he still sent an email asking for it.

Seeing my chance, I told my friend about the website ""Let Me Google That For You"" which plays a short video of someone typing something into a search bar, clicking search, and then getting to whatever link you share with them. The site is meant to insult people asking stupid questions so I thought he'd get a kick out of it. My friend loved it and said he planned to share it with his family like all the others.

A few days later my not so tech-savy friend drops by my desk with his head in his hands. I ask him what's wrong and he tells me he sent the guy a ""Let Me Google That For You"" link to our website which was the top search result.

I'm panicking at this point because it was meant to be a joke, I didn't expect him to send it off to the guy and he seems so down that something must have gone wrong.

I ask him if he got a write up or something since he's obviously not fired and he's shocked. What? No! Nothing like that, he says. I sent the guy the link and he… thanked me. Thought the link was very helpful and proceeded to bookmark and share it with anyone who needed it.

The joke had passed so far over his head he probably couldn't have seen it with binoculars.

"Email: from newish VP of Engineering, 5/13/2002... There is a good chance that this email might do one of the following to you: 1) anger, 2) frighten, 3) have a positive impact.",42,6novu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6novu7/email_from_newish_vp_of_engineering_5132002_there/,12,1500241483.0,"My goal is for #3 to happen but I must say what must be said... Our Delivery organization needs an attitude adjustment.

First, a little perspective...

I have been at <company> for over 10 months now.  During that time period, I have sat back and observed a number of interesting things/behaviors.  Believe me, I have been on both sides of the ""new team being brought in"" situation and I realize it isn't overly comfortable for those folks who have been at a company for a while or the new folks coming in.  For that reason, I typically will do my best over the first 6 months to be sensitive to the range of actions and emotions that typically go on... This include:

1. Old team thinks the the new team wants to change everything without any good reason; Everything works so why change it?

2. New team thinks the the old team is not opening their minds to new ideas; There is definitely a better way to do things...

Typically, within 6 months, things get better and the old team and the new team eventually work things out and become the ""newest"" team.  I've actually waited an additional 4 months longer than usual and the ""newest team"" has yet to emerge.  This makes me very unhappy.

So, what do i do?  Well, this is when I change things the way I want them.  I will no longer wait for the correct behaviors to surface.

Here's how it will work from tomorrow forward...

I was once told that there are actually 6 options that a boss and an employee have when they are not in synch:

1. The boss is terminated by his/her boss and the employee gets his/her way.
2. The boss quits and the employees gets his/her way.
3. The boss changes his/her mind and defers control to the employee therefore giving in to his/her way.
4. The employee change his/her behavior and gets in synch with the boss.
5. The employee quits.
6. The boss terminate the employee.

The above has actually held true throughout my career and I suspect it has held true in yours as well.  Given the above, I can tell you that #1, #2, and #3 are not going to happen.  <VP's boss> is in full support of my actions and I'm committed to making <company> a success by leveraging my knowledge and experience in making Engineering/PS teams successful.  So that really leaves the last 3 options.  We are now at the point where you and I will be making some decisions.

So what are some of the things that will be happening here from this day forward?

1. We will execute (with extreme prejudice) the plans that have been set forth in our v3.0 architecture.  This includes:
    * Anthem architecture and all of its pieces (VTL, Turbine, etc.)
    * Ipedo as the Transaction Engine
    * Oracle as the data warehouse
    * RI as the major piece of Comms
    * JRules as the Rules Engine
2. We will begin doing things the ""right way"" instead of the ""convenient way"".  This includes:
    * Support a schema/dtd structure that is very close to the standard if not a standard
    * Creating the appropriate documentation before development (Architecture, Functional Spec, etc)
    * Publishing our work to source control
    * Following correct CM protocols
    * Following correct QA methodology
    * Conducting peer reviews

Short-cuts are killing us.

3. We will check our attitudes at the door.  I don't require you to like each other but I do require you to work together in an effective manner.  You are all owners of this company.
4. We will be acting entrepreneurial.  I know many of you have families but we need to commit to long hours and tireless commitment to excellent results.  Entrepreneurial companies work nights and weekends to ensure success.  Know many of you work hard but I don't get a feeling that we like what we do and are  committed to making it successful (<VP's boss> shares my feeling on this one and has gone as far as to prove his suspicions).
5. We will not miss project plan dates.  We will give each other support to ensure that we don't.
6. We will make the Sales organizations successful.  Without sales, our stock is worth nothing.  None of us came here for that result.

Net... net... I'm done with screwing around.  Many of you might think I'm a pretty nice guy but you don't want me to feel the way I'm currently feeling for too long.  I was brought here to build a successful Engineering (and recently PS) team.  <VP's boss> has empowered me to do so in any way that makes sense.  We've made some great hires in the Sales, Product Marketing, and PS areas and we won't waste the investment.

So the decision is really yours.  The good news is that you are in control of 2 of the 3 remaining aforementioned options... #4 = Change the behavior or #5 = Decide this company is not really where you want to be.

I'm certainly open to answer questions regarding the above but I must warn you... my patience is thin.  I suggest you digest the above and schedule time with me tomorrow if you want to talk.

Over and out...

Regards,

<VP of Engineering>

Vice President, Engineering

The residents at my college had a penchant for stealing signs… but I didn't realize how much.,114,6n27es,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6n27es/the_residents_at_my_college_had_a_penchant_for/,6,1499958668.0,"I worked as an RA (Resident Assistant) in my residence for a few years back in college. I have many fond memories of those times but I was just reminded of one when I got stuck in traffic on my way to work.

Like most colleges we had our fair share of petty thefts of things like signs, traffic cones, and anything that would catch a drunk college kid's eye. I knew my roommates occasionally took part in it so once I started officially working there I told them to make sure I didn't find out about anything since I didn't want to go full cop on them. They kept it to a minimum, I rarely saw anything of note and we were all happy… right up until the city started doing mass construction nearby.

Suddenly traffic cones started appearing all over the building, signs were popping up at every corner, and construction worker orange seemed to be in every common area. The manager of the building finally had a meeting with the RAs and told us it was getting out of hand. He was fine with the occasional sign appearing and the resident getting a warning because let's face it, keeping college kids in line is like herding cats and he picked his battles. He told us to spread that word that this was all illegal and anyone found in possession of these items could receive a hefty fine if anyone found out. Rather than doing a door to door witch hunt he said that starting the following monday anyone who had any of these items could drop them off at the office, no questions asked and he would take care of it. We made the rounds, told everyone the news and happily went about our weekend. I had a fun moment with my roommates standing in their bedroom sharing the info and pointedly ignoring the Orange sign five feet to my right.

The following monday I had to drop by the front office to check something on our schedule and was met with quite the site. 

Heavy metal signs were stacked to one side so deep the secretary could barely make it to her desk, small traffic cones were stacked on every surface, and large pylons were placed creating walkways for visitors.

Apparently the residents were all too happy to get rid of their ill gotten goods once they realized there was a possible fine (I'm not sure how they didn't realize this before hand) but the manager had underestimated the number of participants.

I found out later that the manager spent the rest of the day making trips back and forth as well as having a long discussion with one of the construction guys who I'm told wound up laughing at the whole situation in the end.

tl;dr

College kids steal a lot of stuff, manager gives them a free pass if they give it back, manager's office turns into an obstacle course from the sheer number of items.",2017-07-13 18:11:08

We’d been transferred to a new job site after a botched job placement in the summer youth program we had signed up for. As one of the only remaining options, we jumped at it. How bad could it be? We went inside and inquired with the center director and office manager, who quickly brought us up to speed and gave us some work gear. We were then introduced to the kids and the rest of the group leaders. Okay. So far so good. I wound up with the youngest age group for the remainder of the day as we played indoor games. The rest, is pretty much history.

One of the group leaders was the center’s program coordinator. She was a great person to be around. She was the one who showed me most of the ropes when I eventually became a permanent staff member at the center. One of the earliest things I learned from her was why the children were forbidden to play on the fixed structures in the playground. Through her, some poking around on the computers and old incident reports combined, I learned of The Incident. The center director had made it known at a meeting after the end of summer camp one day that it was the reason for why the center was under a lot of scrutiny by headquarters.

Having happened the year before I first started, the “incident” remained fresh in many heads since then, and I’m sure that if you asked the kids who saw it first hand, they would tell you everything. Per the information I gathered, the story begins with the K-2 age group of kids lining up at the water fountains for a water break. The group leader attending to them at the time decides to take the opportunity to poke into the main office, which is not more than 25-30 feet from the fountains. As he does so, the kids take it upon themselves to run out into the playground as the door is wide open after getting their water. Supposedly some water puddles had formed on the ground and that made some of the kids’ shoes wet.
Not long after is there a piercing shriek and a girl is somehow bleeding from her nether regions. She’d slipped, fell and caught the pull up monkey bar between the legs as she attempted to stand on them. She was rushed into the office by another staff member who was manning the front desk area where the center director at the time administered first aid. The child’s pants were not removed but instead bandages/gauze were applied on top of the clothing to help stall the bleeding until paramedics arrived to take her away. The stepfather of the little 7-year old victim wasn’t very happy about this situation and threatened legal action against the center though that is something I never saw come up in the years since.

I never found out the extent of the little girl’s wounds, but I overheard one day the kids mentioning that the injuries left her with trouble using the bathroom. The group leader in charge basically lost his job and life went on as usual.

An instance of comedic relief at the hospital,42,6mbene,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6mbene/an_instance_of_comedic_relief_at_the_hospital/,5,1499650422.0,"I've been working as tray runner in the kitchen of one of the biggest hospitals in my city and surrounding areas since May.

One tray was going to a room that was near one of the trauma rooms, where they were working on someone who had just been brought in. The trauma room being in use is a common occurrence when I go to the ER, so I ignored the commotion and set about my business.

As I'm getting the tray ready to actually go into the designated room, the commotion suddenly picks up with some added noise. I look up in time to see several paramedics booking it down the hallway with a woman on an ambulance stretcher who was just brought in. She was extremely pregnant and in labor. As they went by, she proceeded to scream at the top of her lungs, ""IT'S COMING OUT NOOOOOOOOW!"" The entourage disappeared around the corner and about a minute later I heard transport being paged to triage to get this lady up to Labor and Delivery. Hope they made it. In the meantime, I just stood there for a second thinking, ""did I REALLY just see that??"". It was like something straight out of a scripted sitcom.",2017-07-10 04:33:42
Literally Cleaning Crap/After-hours Shower,18,6lyovv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6lyovv/literally_cleaning_crapafterhours_shower/,2,1499483726.0,"Hey guys, my last post seemed to be well-received (Grad Party) so I thought I'd post a double-story, one from last Sunday and the other from today. For those who didn't read the last one, I work at my local Christian-oriented fitness facility. 
 
1: Last Sunday, I got a call from the other janitor on duty asking me to meet her at the family locker room. I get there and she takes me to the area leading to the pool, and there's a couple turds laying on the ground. While waiting and directing traffic around the poop, I get a call on my radio from the MOD asking me to meet him in the boy's locker room.

I head over there, turn the corner to the shower area, and immediately see a literal pile of crap on the floor. He tells me to go get the hose downstairs and we use it to try and spray it into oblivion. He goes at it for maybe five minutes, then hands the hose to me and goes to finish up his rounds. I have to step out twice to get some air and not vomit, and finally give in. Thankfully third shift was given the task of cleaning it up.
 
2: On Fridays, we close the building at 9 (hour earlier than the rest of the work week). The MOD gives a warning over the speakers starting at half hour til, so people have plenty of time. When we finally close, I go into the locker room and start taking care of towels. Normally we have a few guys finishing getting dressed and it's all good. Not tonight. Tonight, I had a guy decide to take a shower FIVE MINUTES AFTER WE CLOSED. I thought he was going back to use the bathroom, so I thought nothing of it until the MOD came in and asked me if the one guy left was it. I said someone went to the back but I haven't seen him yet, which is when we realize that there's a shower running. He goes back and tells the guy he needs to stop and get dressed. Normally I say to the people who apologize ""the longer you're here, the more I get paid"" but I'm not going to be joking when you know were closed and yet take a shower. ",2017-07-08 06:15:26
"My bosses railroaded me in a meeting that I recorded, which I turned into a funny video. I quit, and later I sent it to them and their bosses.",118,6lq9b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6lq9b4/my_bosses_railroaded_me_in_a_meeting_that_i/,15,1499389286.0,"The video: [Lessons in Management](https://youtu.be/ynx66kI5DSk)
(Last names and the company name have been edited out.)

The backstory:
I used to be a supervisor at a food production plant. One of my duties was to make sure employees were keeping up with their assigned cleaning duties.

One employee, whose full time job was to clean drains, was not doing it. And I don't mean he was doing it poorly, he wasn't doing it at all. So I started to document it with pictures which I then sent to my supervisor, who then showed them to his manager.

The drains got cleaned after this, and right before an audit of the facility.

Unfortunately, it soon went right back to the way it was. I spent the six months trying to get this guy to do his job, photographing drains and emailing various managers in attempt to correct the situation.

The employee was given a written warning about 2 months into this 6-month ordeal and it changed nothing. A few months into this I was told by other employees that I should leave the situation alone because this guy was personal friends with my manager, hanging out at his house and at the bar with him, and that I would never get anywhere. This only made me try harder.

I tried to get four separate superiors to deal with it. Eventually, I contacted the 2nd-in-charge at the plant and it was finally taken care of. Still no further discipline, but the drains were clean and I was content with that.

A couple of weeks later this employee started telling people in the plant that was I out to get him because he had caught me hitting on his wife on Facebook. I immediately informed my managers of this story (one of them being the personal friend of the drain guy) and they brought him in for a meeting (without me). I was told by these managers the following day that he had admitted to making this story up and that he was told he would be fired if he did anything like this again, but no discipline was handed down, no documentation.

After this I told my bosses that I no longer wanted to work as a supervisor under them and I took another job in the plant under another manager. Life improved slightly.


Many months later an entirely separate incident occurred... 

The drain guy's friend/manager bought pizzas for just that department. Something that he did often (on the company account). The rest of the plant was typically annoyed that the company was paying for pizzas for ""his boys"". Still feeling disgust for this manager and his ways, I went to their breakroom and took one of the pizzas and shared it with my co-workers.

This evidently pissed someone off. Almost 2 weeks later I found an anonymous, sarcastic sympathy card on the outside of my locker in the men's room. It had a handwritten note inside, in a woman's handwriting, along with a gift card to the local pizza place. 

I called the pizza joint and found out who had bought the gift card. It turned out to be another guy from that department that I used to supervise. This guy had been a total dick to me for years so that removed some of the humor from it. Now it just seemed like a dick move, hanging up this sarcastic card for the whole plant to laugh at, and by a guy that everyone knew treated me like shit.

Anyway, since this guy refused to talk to me, and had to have his wife write the note for him, I figured it would be appropriate for me to thank her. So I did. Sarcastically. Through a private Facebook message. Just a simple note thanking her for the card and saying how nice it was nice of her to write this note for her husband. A back and forth ensued with her being mad and me being annoyingly polite.

The guy then complained to the manager that I had contacted his wife on Facebook. So I was hauled into a meeting with the plant manager and 4 other managers. I was suspended from work for three days for ""contacting the spouse of an employee on Facebook.""

I was a little pissed since all these managers saw that this note was up for three days before I found it and just waited for a situation to play out. In the meeting, the fact that the wife wrote the note and the guy hung it up to harass me no longer mattered. It was like time reset once I sent that FB message. But in the end, stupid as the whole thing was, I accepted my punishment.

But during this meeting things took a weird turn. The plant manager said this reminded him of 'the time I contacted the wife of the drain cleaning guy'. And right next to him sat the manager that told me the drain guy had admitted to making the story up, who all of a sudden had trouble recalling that part of the story...

I actually never talked to the plant manager about the BS story from the drain guy, so his information could only have come from this manager, personal friend of drain guy.

So it began to make a little more sense; this manager had convinced the plant manager that there was a pattern of me doing this sort of thing and maybe that's why this seemed like such a big deal. Of course I objected and told them how it really went down. So then he says its not relevent. Yeah the guy that brought it up said it wasn't relevant to this situation! And then he says he doubts his super manager would have forgotten that drain guy had confessed to making it up. 

This meeting went on for 20 minutes, and I recorded all of it. Them raising their voices at me while I laugh at them and defiantly defend myself against drain guy's slander.

A couple of weeks later I quit that job. The whole thing just felt dirty and I knew I'd never be able to work for those people.


Almost a year later I took that recording and turned it into a funny video lampooning my bosses, using various still photos to depict what was happening, and proving that my story was true texts exchanged with my manager. Of course I used fake, unflattering images to represent my bosses. I then sent it to some former coworkers.

It spread like wildfire at the plant! There's about 120 employees there and it had 115 views in 3 days. I felt pretty proud of myself at first. But then I started to wonder if I had gone far enough. 

So I typed up a timeline of events about the drain guy, add the photos of the filthy drains that I had taken and screenshots of the texts and emails I had sent to my managers about it, all in chronological order. As well as a screenshot of drain guy's wife herself saying that his story was untrue.

I then emailed all of it to the president and vice president of the company (plant manager's bosses) and told them that they should see the video that everyone was watching at one of their plants. And yes, I was kind enough to provide a link to the video.

Then I emailed the plant manager and the other managers (as well as a bunch of random managers and salespeople) and told them what I had just done. I figured the subject would have to be brought up by one side or the other if it was in separate emails. And I did all this on the morning of a holiday. Hopefully it ruined the holiday and allowed it some extra time to fester before they returned to work to face each other and their employees.

You'd think the head of a food company would be a little upset about a manager choosing a friendship over the cleanliness of his plant, as well as conspiring to slander the employee that reported it to him. But we'll see.

Charter flights are fun (xpost from /r/MaliciousCompliance - NSFW language),110,6ke2vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6ke2vi/charter_flights_are_fun_xpost_from/,14,1498801737.0,"I got told to crosspost some of my stories in /r/talesfromtechsupport but it didn't seem appropriate for that subreddit so I'm here.  I hope you enjoy this one.

Several years ago I was working logistics and materials coordination on a very large project.  We had manufacturing hubs in several south-east Asian countries and were regularly sending material to and from the far north of Australia and those places.

Because Planning were not the sharpest tools in the shed and because the Project Director really didn't bother listening to Planning anyway, we wound up with a lot of stuff in Australia when it should have been in Thailand.  This is a Bad Thing and needs to be fixed yesterday.

*Side note:  it was a Bad Thing because the Project Director decided to alter the manufacturing schedule to save a few $$$.  Ok, a lot of $$$ but it really threw a massive spanner in the works.*

The decision gets made to do a charter flight on one of the big Antonovs.  You know, the kind that cost a million bucks to reposition and burn $50k/hr in fuel (costs were accurate back in the day anyway, they're more expensive now).  So I start putting together an inventory list of everything that needs to go across.

Over the course of several weeks, the email CC list grows to about 50 people who all want ""buy in"" and need their shit sent across ""urgently"".  There's also a growing inventory in Thailand that needs to come back.  So now we're up to 3 charter flights both there & back again.  About $11 million, chump change.

So as I'm planning the 4th of the 3 charter flights, the Project Director is also flipping his shit about how much this is costing.  The instruction from on high is to make 1038947098% sure that everything that needs to go on this last charter goes and that nothing is left behind.

Well I've got everyone on the list on speed dial at this stage so I send out an alert that I'm sending out a materials list spreadsheet for everything that is going on this final plane.  All people are required to review and respond and that non response will be taken as endorsement of the list because were on a strict deadline.

Everything gets packed up by the crew in Darwin.  Plane takes off and we all pat ourselves on the back as the plane leaves at about 11pm on a Friday night.

*ring ring* WTF, I go *ring ring*

**""Dave"":** This is Dave in Thailand (they're a few hours behind Australia) and I don't see valve XYZ-123 on the manifest.

**Me:** That's because it's not on the manifest.  Everything was loaded onto the plane according to the spreadsheet I sent out several times over the past week.  Let me check.  You were copied in and acknowledged receipt of the emails on Date and Date.

**Dave:** We need that valve here in Thailand to complete the punch list for PAM 907.

*Here it's worthwhile to point out that PAM 907 was on the critical path and was utterly necessary for the plant to operate.  Delivery on time formed part of all the senior management's KPIs and therefore bonus*

**Me:** It's not on the plane.  Looking at the records the valve is still at site.

**Dave:** That valve needs to get on the plane!  Get a truck to site and drive it to the airport.  (Site is 700km, 500 miles from the airport and it's midnight on Friday night).

**Me:** Dave, the plane left 3 hours ago.  We can't get the valve on the plane.

**Dave:** That fucking valve needs to get to Thailand by Monday or PAM 907 isn't sailing.  So find a fucking way. *click*

*PAM 907 was coming via barge and sailed next Friday..  There was no way that we could get the valve to Thailand on a commercial flight by the end of the week and certainly not in enough time to install, test and sign off.*

So I turn to my long suffering co worker and miracle worker ""JC"".  JC was a latin American legend who knew logistics inside and out and if anyone could make the impossible happen it was him.

**Me:** JC?

**JC:** Que?

**Me:** Great job on the charter by the way but Dave in Thailand says that a valve didn't make it on board.

**JC:** Is not my fucking problem, plane already in the air.

**Me:** Dave says that the valve is required for PAM 907, we have to get it there by Monday morning so they can install it, test and get the PAM on the barge.

*JC is smart cookie.  He knows what this means*

**JC:** *swears in Spanish for about 5 minutes straight - I don't speak the language but I'm pretty sure he didn't repeat himself*

**JC:** Call that cunt puta shit for brains back and tell him that he needs to get Project Director's sign off to turn the plane around.

**Me:** Fuck, OK.

*ring ring*

**Dave:** What?

**Me:** You need to get Project Director's approval to turn the charter plane around.

**Dave:** What the fuck?  No fucking way.

**Me:** It's not possible to put the valve on a commercial plane and have it there by Friday let alone in time to install & test.

**Dave:** I don't want to hear it.  Just fucking get that valve here, I don't care what you have to do.

**Me:** I'll need that in writing.

**Dave:** Fine *click*

I get the email in writing and call my boss.  JC is still swearing.  Boss has the unenviable task of waking up Project Director and explaining the situation.

JC gets to turn the plane around.  I get to wake up crews in Darwin to move the valve.  Plane lands, valve is loaded, plane leaves.

Dave's contract is not renewed.",2017-06-30 08:48:57

She looked at me like I was a rambling mad man and said ""Uh... Is there a problem?"" I said no and kept ringing things up, it was like 240 dollars in total. The last story Ill say is I asked a guy ""Hey are you ready to check out sir?"" And he said ""No I no check out, I just take."" Then smiled at me creepily.

Graduation Party,30,6k156e,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6k156e/graduation_party/,3,1498662477.0,"FTP here, on mobile so sorry for any issues. I'm a locker room attendant at the local Y, so on top of my regular janitorial duties I also keep the men's locker room clean and take care of our dirty towels. This story happened a couple weeks ago so I'll try to remember it as best I can. 
 
Me=me, M=mom, D=daughter. 
 
I'm over by my locker room when a call comes over the radio from the front desk, asking for custodial. As the front desk is right near me, I walk to them and ask what's up. They point me to a mother and daughter (M and D) and say that they're setting up for a graduation party in one of our community rooms and need chairs to be set up. Tables are already set up so I ask how many chairs and they say probably 80 (8 per table). No problem, I grab what I can from the storage room near the room they're using and go upstairs to grab the rest. 
 
I come back and help take the chairs off the racks while they set them up, and all the while I hear them bickering and catch a hint of ""we're very important people"" tone in the voice (hint: they're not very important people). Whatever, I'm doing what I can to help. We're all done with chairs, and as I'm taking the racks and extra chairs away they then ask me for a vacuum, so I grab mine and bring it to them. They turn it on, and can't figure out where the lever is to be able to maneuver it better (not sure how to describe it, but I'm sure you guys know what I mean.) I go show them and say ""you really have to stomp on it"" with a laugh, and D emotionlessly says ""thanks."" I go take care of things in the locker room and come back to see how they're doing. They tell me they're all done with the vacuum and thank me, and I ask if they need anything else. 
 
M: Can you go and ask if there's anything going on in the other room tomorrow? (Room they use is one divided by a removable wall.) 
Me: Sure, lemme go check. 

*I ask front desk, they say there's something from 8-2*

Me: They said there's something from 8-2.

D: WHAT??? 

M: What did you say? 

D: He said there's something from 8-2.

M: We were told there was something 8-1!

Me: That's just what I was told. 

M huffs out of the room, saying very clearly that they will never come back and should've gone somewhere else. She proceeds to take her frustration out on the front desk worker, who handles it very well. 

At the end of my shift, I'm restocking towels by the women's locker room when the front desk worker comes over and asks how I'm doing. She says that later the lady came back and asked nicely if they could get more chairs but if somebody else could, as ""the janitor (me) had already done so much to help"" and they didn't want to make me do any more. Thanks, but you'd been rude all night long. A little nice comment like that, as much as I appreciated it, changes nothing. 
 
Two side notes. 
1. There was a call on the radio from our MOD to another janitor saying these people needed a ladder and wondered where to get one. As I walked past him, carrying the ladder he found, he looked at the front desk workers and said ""Watch, they're gonna say 'this won't work, it's too short.'"" Everyone down front knew how rude they were. 
2. Turns out there was something later on in the next room. One of my coworkers had her college grad party in there, and said that she was in the bathroom with the mother and another lady. The mother was complaining about how the floor wasn't vacuumed and how they, yet again, were never coming back.",2017-06-28 18:07:57
It's Raining Cats and Dogs. And Giraffes.,41,6jt0bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6jt0bc/its_raining_cats_and_dogs_and_giraffes/,3,1498573487.0,"Sometimes things go horribly wrong and the only person to blame is Mother Nature. 

I'm the carnival barker for a Ring Toss game. For a few dollars you get 30 rings to try and throw one so it lands around the neck of a bottle [like so] (https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1d22b082924c28bba5c4b983e771ca95). Our set up is very similar to [this] (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jmpsqGfE7Wo/VBNORxx1wDI/AAAAAAAAL3c/irMBGi70Pk8/s1600/IMG_0423.JPG), open on three sides with prizes hanging down from the ceiling, on shelves attached to the ceiling, and on shelves on the back wall. Also at the back wall is several buckets to store excess rings. There are several rows of bottles, with a gap in between rows to catch rings that miss. The operator has to spend most of his time fishing out rings from the rack (which goes all the way to the back under the aforementioned storage buckets), as it can take up to a half an hour to clean them all out depending on how many rings are out and about. This requires spending a lot of time crawling around under the thing with a hook. [It's a really nice hook] (https://youtu.be/heMFNsjYmZE?t=1m29s). For prizes we have a variety of stuffed animals, from tigers to Weiner dogs. Our largest prizes are these 3ft tall giraffes that are really unstable and fall over a lot, but the smaller ones tend to stay up very well. As part of my duties I also have to watch over the clown slingshot game on the other side of the wall, but you don't need to know the ins and outs of that for this story. 

When I first came in to work the area is a disaster. Every single ring is on the rack (there are 200 of them), a few giraffes have fallen over, one shelf is completely empty, part of the siding that had been coming loose is now completely off, ammo from the clown game is all over the floor, and an entire row of bottles has dominoed over. This row happens to be the middle one, requiring a delicate act with the hook. The whole thing takes an hour and a half to clean up, and we're just getting started. 

Due to inventory issues the majority of the restocking delivery is for the clown game, even though the ring toss is missing an entire shelf of prizes. My manager suggests spreading the prizes out to make it look like there are more of them. This is a good idea, but moving prizes on the back shelves involves moving the storage buckets, climbing up on the rack, tiptoeing around the giant unstable giraffes, and then climbing back down within 30s to make sure nobody has lined up at the clown game while you couldn't see it. To make matters worse I had put the storage buckets on the counter and a curious 3 year old was grabbing handfuls of rings and throwing them at random people; I had to leap off the rack and over the counter to go chase all the stray rings. I'm also handing out rings to people with essentially no time to clean, meaning that after I was finished with that I had 150 rings to deal with. 

And then the wind started to pick up. 

I was on the floor hooking rings when a smaller giraffe was blown off a ceiling shelf and landed on the bottles.  It was followed by several tigers and a Weiner dog, 3 of which bounced off the counter and rolled away. The entirety of the shelf I had meticulously rearranged prizes to fell off and landed on top of me. Every single one of the giant giraffes keeled over and wiped out row after row of bottles. One of them hit the card reader and knocked it off the wall. I had to run after escapees, fish stuffed animals out of the rack, restore bottle formation, collect rings, engage with customers, and wrangle with a dying card reader all at the same time with more disaster coming with every gust of wind. I gave up returning stuffed animals to their places and started piling them in the clown game. After a while I had managed to get all the rings out of the rack and close the overhead gate on one side to block more wind just in time for my  shift to end. 

TL;DR Wind caused a stuffed animal avalanche. ",2017-06-27 17:24:47

They had an odd relationship, and it included him feeding her his beer when she was only 16. But stories for another day there.


She liked to pretend attack him and then run away. One day, she came up from behind and went to kick him playfully. I guess he'd been doing some self defense classes, and instinct kicked in. He grabbed her leg and lifted. She went in the air and did a complete 180. Landed on the top of her spine where it meets the neck on our concrete floor. The manager was sure he was going to get arrested, but she said she was fine. She also said she was seeing double for the rest of the night, but who am I to judge?",2017-06-21 07:46:31

Today, a dad is filling out paperwork on his two kids and looks me dead in the face and asks ""What size is [son]?""

Uh, what?

The guy wanted me to tell him what size tshirt he wears, when the kid is wearing a tshirt and I've never seen him before. When I said ""I'm not sure"" he looked ten kinds of annoyed.

Once upon a time, when we were struggling, broke, and not yet married, she worked two retail jobs. I only worked one because I was a manager and needed open availability. She worked at a department store (job A) and a discount clothes/home goods (job B) store that were right next to each other. The discount store was the worse of the two. Weird scheduling, not consulting her hours from her main job, open until 2am for some awful reason.
One night she was closing at job B, she became very ill. Coughing, wheezing, could barely breathe or stand. They refused to let her leave despite it being dead from 11-2. Literally 2 customers. The next day she called in at job A and went to the doctor. It was full fledged pneumonia. Doctor told her to take a couple of the weeks off, here's your note, drink your fluids. Job A was pretty okay with it. She was brand new and they still accommodated her. Job B...
When she called to tell them, her manager's exact words were ""Your killing me, wuliten's wife.""
She never went back to that job. She found an office job at an HVAC company that paid more, and was a year of hell, but those are probably stories for another sub.
The icing on the cake came a month later. At some point, her boss from job B came into job A while my wife was working. They saw her, she saw them, and they awkwardly avoided each other. A week after, job B called and said something along the lines of ""We haven't seen you at work in a while, we were wondering if you wanted some hours next week.""",2017-06-16 01:02:51

I will kick them in the shins *so hard.*

For those of you who have avoided dealing with this nonsense, a little background. It's meant to be a sorta-crowd-sourced system for increasing efficiency in the workplace. The idea is, someone sees some process or system that could be improved, develops a way to improve it, and submits it. The company then adopts the change and becomes that much more efficient. Maybe someone notices that they're running the TPS query for multiple reports, and figures running it once for the first one and having all reports link to those results would cut down on server load.

On paper, this seems great. Everyone's doing little improvements, and they all add up. Awesome, right?

The problem is that this system is used by large companies, full of red tape and bureaucracy. Processes must be followed, and trying to push through all these little changes just creates more red tape to wade through.

Wasteland had a rule that all their employees had to have at least one Six Sigma project under their belt within a certain period of time, and my deadline was approaching. I was on the lookout for something- anything- that I could improve on. Inspiration finally came when I was updating some test data. I was doing basically entering the same data for all the tests, by hand since there was no tool to do it. The programmer in me figured that this nonsense ought to be automated.

So I submit this. My boss thinks it's a good project, but I have to follow the Six Sigma process. For efficiency.

First is writing up a proposal, stating the problem, my solution and how my solution was to be implemented and tested. Standard stuff, so far.

My solution was to write a script that would do the duplicated data automatically. But I couldn't write the actual script, because the database used a proprietary programming language, and only the DB developers were allowed to program stuff for it. So what to do? I wrote up the algorithm I had in mind in pseudo-code and submitted it with the proposal, but procedure required that I test it somehow. For efficiency.

Yes, I had to officially test whether doing something by hand was slower than automating it. For efficiency. But how to do this if I couldn't program something for the actual database? The answer turned out to be ""fake it"". I mocked up a fake DB on my local machine, and wrote a fake program to do the fake updates to my fake DB.

And how to time it? My boss, who was probably as irritated with this nonsense as I was, said to time it with my watch and they'd just take my word for it. Apparently, efficiency needs to be tested, but not verified. Had I not been mostly honest, I could probably have faked the whole thing, but I actually went through with it. I ran my update program, then did the exact same updates by hand, and timed them both. I wrote up these times and submitted them with my report. *For efficiency.*

So the project was accepted, and now it was time to implement it. As I said earlier, only the DB developers were allowed to program actual DB scripts. I begged and pleaded to be able to write the thing. It would have taken me maybe 10 minutes, 15 if we leave time for testing. But it was not to be. Policy had to be followed, and policy stated that only the DB devs could make this change. All I could do was submit the project and hope it eventually made it to the right people. **For motherfucking efficiency!**

**Six months later,** I was still updating the test data manually. I don't know what happened to my project, and eventually I stopped caring. Once it was submitted, I got credit for it and was rewarded with a Wasteland Six Sigma polo shirt and a certificate that I probably lost. Wasteland didn't care whether your change was implemented, only that you submitted it and followed procedure. Essentially, it was busy-work for its own sake, the exact opposite of what Six Sigma claims to be.

I could have fixed it in ten minutes, but because we had to follow the Six Sigma process, it was drawn out for at least a year, and may have fallen through the cracks, resulting in wasted work and time. **EFFICIENCY!**",2017-06-15 07:23:24
"PSA: If you have full-coverage insurance on your car, please don't call AAA when you're in an accident that requires a tow truck!",34,6h91ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6h91ik/psa_if_you_have_fullcoverage_insurance_on_your/,12,1497461547.0,"I was going through some old pictures on my phone, and I came across one from back when I was a tow truck operator, and thought I'd share a story, and a little friendly advice.

--

The towing business I worked for is a small, local business, and they have a contract with AAA. Any calls in my town from AAA customers go straight to this towing business - they don't pay much (peanuts, really), but usually they make up for the lack of payment with volume. $7 for a tire change or a jump start isn't much, but it adds up when you do 150 of them in an afternoon. Because of that, we were happy to do AAA calls and help them out when they needed us. But AAA is supposed to be for basic services - your car breaks down, we'll tow you to a nearby shop. Your battery dies, we'll jump you. You lock your keys in the car, we'll get it open. Things like that. It's not meant for major, catastrophic things that should normally be handled by insurance. Which brings us to the story...

--

It was the middle of December in the midwest, and it was *cold*. There wasn't any snow on the ground yet, but the wind was biting and it was miserable outside in the middle of the night. I was on-call for $WreckerService, and got a call about 1 in the morning - pretty common for our college town, we tended to get a lot of calls as the bars are closing down. Usually it was the police calling me at this hour, but tonight it was AAA. They've got a customer who was in a ""fender bender"" (their words) and needed a tow to the body shop. Alright, no problem! I'll grab them real quick and be home in no time, as they're just on the other side of town from me.

--

I head over to the scene, and the cops and firefighters are finishing up and leaving for the evening. [I immediately knew that this wasn't going to be a quick, simple ""fender bender""](http://imgur.com/a/s5LuV) grab when I pulled up and found a Jeep Cherokee parked in the back seat of a Kia. Literally - the front wheels and oil pan of the Jeep were resting on the Kia's back seat, the rear windshield and back end of the roof having been peeled away like a sardine can. Thankfully, nobody was seriously hurt - the Kia had been parked on the street, and the girl driving the Jeep (drunk) had been checked out and arrested.

--

I approached the owner of the Jeep - the girl's dad - and started discussing what he wanted done with the Jeep. It was going to the body shop for repairs. Our conversation went like this:

Me: ""Do you have full coverage insurance on the Jeep?""

Dad: ""Yes.""

Me: ""So insurance is paying for the repairs?""

Dad: ""Right.""

Me: ""Okay, well then why don't I cancel your AAA ticket and save you one of your annual tows - I'll charge the cost of the tow to the shop, who will simply add it to the bill they send to insurance. You won't have to pay me anything at all, and you can save your tow.""

Dad: ""No, it's okay, I've used AAA for accidents before.""

--

Guys. *Guys*. Please don't do that. What I was trying to get across to this guy, without blatantly shoving it in his face that it was about money, is that it was about money. You see, if I'd been allowed to claim the tow as a cash call, and bill the body shop (who would in turn bill insurance), I would have charged around $300. 

--

Now, that might sound a little high, but look at it like this: it's 1 in the morning in December in the Midwest - it's about two fucking degrees outside. I'm tired, I'm cold, and I've got some work ahead of me. I have to separate these two vehicles while trying not to cause any extra damage to them. I have to clean up the accident scene - I have to wander around in the dark, picking up the pieces of the cars that have gone flying everywhere, cleaning up all the debris and broken glass spread all over the road, cleaning up all the spilled fluids. Then I've got to drive out of town to the body shop their insurance wants to use to unload it into their lot. I'm not going to make it home until some time after 2 in the morning - before 3, if I'm lucky. For doing all the hard, miserable work in the wee hours of the night, I get to charge a premium - but **only** if I get to charge cash prices. It's also important to note that, during on-call hours, I don't get paid hourly - I work on commission. For calls that we charge cash prices for, I make 25% of the ticket, so for this call I stood to take home $75 for my trouble, before taxes. Now, that isn't bad, but, again, I'm only making that much money *if* I can charge the cash price.

--

But dude is insisting on keeping this a AAA call, which means a *lot* less money for $WreckerService and myself. For the same amount of work and time, AAA is going to pay $56 to $WreckerService, of which I will make 35% (we were given a higher percentage of AAA calls to help offset how much less the calls were worth). That's $19 before taxes. That feels a *lot less* worth my effort.

--

I tried politely to talk the guy into letting me close the AAA ticket and charging it to insurance, but he's not having it. So I did my job, got the cars separated, got everything cleaned up, got his Jeep to the shop, and got home at about 2:45 in the morning, dirty, cold, and pissed off because I just missed out on two hours of sleep so that I could bring home enough money for lunch at McDonald's.

--

Guys. Do your tow-truck driver a favor, and don't screw him over. If you're in a major accident and repairs on your vehicle are covered by insurance, your tow is part of that total bill. If you call AAA, you are not doing anyone any favors. By all means, call them when you need them, but be smart.",2017-06-14 20:32:27

Subject: RE: technology stack




Hi $Mgr, $wannabeMgr and $co,

 

Tbh,

Only problem I see with $scotsman is he’s pretty good at pointing out the issues.

The task he’s been given is to get some clarity on the mobility field so we can approach the $GovOrg with a clear $hell united front.

So far most answers to questions that were asked in $country that have been given by our team are way too indirect.

I’m getting tired of having to give people BS answers because our team doesn’t have its stuff together instead of straight answers.

 

I’ll put the risk more clearly:

If we don’t start giving solid answers we risk not becoming the primary delivery organization for the $GovOrg. (And I don’t need to remind you that’s the biggest account for $hell $MyCountry.)

 

And $co, $scotsman IS NOT THE PROBLEM. He’s a guy who has even less patience for political BS cover-your-own-ass games then I have. (He’s a technical guy who needs to make things happen on $GovClient level.)

 


CURRENT PROBLEMS:


    ·        My big mouth while venting frustrations


    ·        Me being pretty junior expected to take quite some responsibility with often slow feedback


    ·        $Mgr is busy doing who-knows-what instead of

                             o   deciding on ONE strategy,

                             o   sticking to it

                             o   appointing people to make it happen

                             o    creating an organogram so we can see who does what


    ·        $Mgr saying “good idea” or “we’ll do that” and then not following up on it or not giving people clear instructions to do that, which ends up in $Mgr thinking half a second later that it has been done and finished


    ·        $co judging $scotsman without knowing the guy (everyone says we could use some local guidance for me, well $scotsman helped me out on multiple occasions and I detest seeing a personal attack like that.)


    ·        Our team existing 2 years and still not having a proper foundation or enough maturity


    ·        Too little or to many standards (barely any general rules within the team, except some half-baked stuff.)


    ·        All different stuff being started while not being properly finished


    ·        A lot of people giving BS answers and ppt/presentations instead of getting to the point


    ·        A big part of each team meeting is often used for sales talk instead of a short overview of where we stand.


    ·        The zombie-factor: if someone requests input from the team, only a select few will give feedback (unless you drag it out.)

 

I know this mail’s been brutal, and it’s intended to be so hopefully some of the problems will finally be handled by the ones who got the power to make the necessary changes.


I don’t need nor want a reply with promises; I need to see the problems being solved. And don’t propose to set up meetings to talk on how to solve the issues we have, just solve them.

"Closed Area Tales, part 6: Wasteland and the Security Glitches",30,6g5kkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6g5kkw/closed_area_tales_part_6_wasteland_and_the/,0,1496974513.0,"A few teething troubles are to be expected with a new building. A few. Wasteland's new building had more than a few.

Our closed area had two exits, the main one and the emergency exit. They were only about 50 feet from each other and on the same hallway, so I'm not sure what advantage there was to this arrangement. For the first few days, the security company kept getting alerts that people were going through the emergency exit. All our cubicles had a good view of this door, and that wasn't happening. Eventually, they determined that the wires had been crossed up with the door next to it, the main entrance to another project's closed area.

But the main door had problems, too. By this time, I'd been at Wasteland long enough to finally have the ability to lock the closed area, myself. The first time I tried to close up the lab, the lock wouldn't arm, no matter what I did. That meant I couldn't leave, as we're not allowed to leave the lab unlocked and unattended. I asked the security guard, and even he didn't know what to do about it. Apparently, he'd tried to get his boss to tell him how to work the alarms, but got yelled at for ""trying to tell the customer how to do their job"". Maybe I'm clueless, but I'd think that knowing how to lock the doors and arm and disarm the alarms would by an important part of the guard's job. And that begs the question of what to do if the last person out didn't have the door combo. We had to call the guy's boss at home and have him drive over and deal with it. He wasn't happy. Neither was I, since it made me miss karate class.

That wasn't the last problem with the door. The first issue got solved, but as time went on, it started simply not locking. This was worse than before, because the system would register it being locked and armed, but the lock wouldn't actually engage. If you didn't physically check the door after locking it, you'd never know it had failed. This happened to me, once, and I got written up for leaving the lab unlocked. They weren't kidding about this stuff- a cubicle neighbor actually got fired when she left it unlocked three times.

They eventually figured out what the problem was. The closed areas' doors were metal things with heavy-duty locks installed. They were unusually heavy, and the builders had installed them on frames for ordinary doors. Over time, the extra weight warped the frame enough that the lock no longer lined up.

But I haven't gotten to the biggest security glitch, yet. Our closed area had windows. No, not the operating system. Actual panes of glass in the wall that people can see through.

But our lab was on the second floor and you'd have to scale the wall to see inside, right? Nope! While waiting with the security guard for the supervisor to come deal with the non-arming alarm, he told me a story about another facility he'd worked at. They'd had a closed area with windows, too. Every so often, they'd see little flashes of light out in the woods by the building. Someone eventually investigated this and found that the flashes were from cameras. People were setting up outside with huge telescopic lenses, taking pictures of the computer screens inside the lab.

Fortunately, our lab kept the classified laptops in a separate, windowless alcove (no vault, this time, alas), and everyone had enough sense to turn their monitors away from the windows. But that's not the end of the problem. People aren't always after specific information. Sometimes they're looking for patterns. Metadata.

As an example of this, my mother once had a conversation with the guy who picked up our recycling, and he said that he could always tell when the college students were back home by the contents of the recycling bins. If a bin that usually only contains Diet Coke cans suddenly starts overflowing with a truly superhuman amount of Dr. Pepper cans, you can infer that there's now another person in the house.

This sort of thing is why people tell you to stop your mail and such if you'll be away from home for a while. Patterns, and deviations from those patterns, can be useful information.

In this case, they'd be able to see who was first in or last out of the lab (and therefore who could lock/unlock the door), who regularly went in the classified alcove, who had access to the safes (and with a good enough lens, they might have been able to see the combo). By watching who talked with whom and when, they could discern the chain of command. They wouldn't be able to get any information directly, but they'd know who to target to get it.

And this was apparently a real concern, if the yearly spies-are-bad-don't-be-a-spy-mmkay presentations are to be believed. According to one of them, AquVille ranked 4th in the country for foreign espionage activity. I'm not sure I believe it's that high up, but it was still an issue. We had to sit through multiple presentations and training videos on OPSEC on how to avoid being a target. Things like not wearing our lanyards after work so people wouldn't know what project we were working on, or the army base discontinuing the vehicle decals so the cars aren't marked as targets. I'm probably breaking a few rules by posting this, but all the information I have about Stonehenge or Wasteland is years out of date, so targeting me won't be useful. Sorry, spies!

We actually had a scare, not long after we moved in. Some people reported that there was a mysterious black truck always parked across from the building, that at least once, appeared to be following people home. Management sent out a cautionary email, letting us know what to look for.

Keep in mind, the lot across from ours, where the truck was supposedly parked, was still under construction, at the time. It's very possible that it was just a case of a construction worker having a particularly creepy-looking truck and taking the same route to the highway as the majority of the cubicle-dwellers in the office park. But because it was also possible that it could be someone looking to target Wasteland employees, we all had to be extra careful for a couple of weeks. I never saw the truck, myself, so I can't say which it was.

The windows were fixed by the addition of some blinds, which we were instructed to keep closed at all times.",2017-06-09 05:15:13

Just about every decent-size company in AquVille eventually had a facility in this park, including Missiles-R-Us and several others, most of which I've either interviewed with or worked for at some point. But not NotRockets, oddly enough.

As an aside, this office park is a bit creepy, even today. It's huge, the lots are huge, and it was built right when the economy started to sink into the toilet. Not surprisingly, there weren't too many companies willing to shell out for oversize land parcels and shiny new buildings in the middle of a recession. This left many lots empty. If you drive around, you'll see a lot of empty space, with road turn-ins that go nowhere and ghost-town cul-de-sacs. Some of the lots were leased to farmers, rather than let them go empty, so there's often crops growing right next to the offices. Add in the fact that every building seems to have overestimated the amount of parking they'll need, and evenings that are prone to fog, and it looks like you're basically all alone in the world. The mysterious unidentified buzzing noise from the totally-not-an-evil-villain-compound in the center doesn't help.

They had a big to-do about the groundbreaking for the site. The state's governor even came to it and made a speech. I had a bit of a chuckle when he described the office park as a ""national treasure"". It's an office park! In a town where you can't swing a stick without hitting half a dozen office parks (at least two of which I've worked in)! Okay, he actually meant the stuff being done in the office park, not the park, itself, but still. There's an honest-to-goodness *moon rocket* across the street, and you're going on about an office park. Only in this state.

Management hyped the new building to the moon and back. It would be environmentally friendly! Look at all the new amenities! A cafeteria! A fitness center! An atrium! Ergonomic things all over the place! Multiple closed areas! Decent vending machines! More parking! NotRockets had had a cafeteria and fitness center, too, and that was really the only thing about them that I missed, so I was looking forward to the new place.

Eventually, moving day came, and that was when the fun started.

They'd been at the current facility for several years, and as anyone who's ever moved house can testify to, stuff accumulates. I had it pretty easy. I hadn't been there long, and wasn't in the habit of keeping lots of stuff in the office, anyway. There was a bookshelf full of mysterious binders that had been left there by the office's previous occupant, and a filing cabinet I'd never even looked in. No one could identify what the contents were for. I had to empty them all out and shred the contents.

The document destruction company had dropped off several shred bins (locked bins that you can put documents into but not remove them), but these filled up before noon. We dumped the overflow into some big trash bins, but these filled up, too. There was a pile literally as tall as I am of paper waiting to be shredded. They probably made a mint that day.

We all had junk to throw out, and the hallway was soon overflowing with trash. The veteran ubertechie down the hall had it the worst. He'd been there as long as Wasteland had been at that facility. The pile outside his office was nearly blocking the hallway, and was almost as tall as me. I took a look though it, just to see what the heck it all was. Floppy disks, backup tapes, Zip disks, Jaz disks (ask your parents, kids), PC cards, software boxes dating back to the mid-90's, SCSI cables, serial cables, various other cables I couldn't identify, what might have been RAM chips. I suspect if I dug through the pile I might have found punchcards or UNIVAC parts (ask your grandparents, kids).

By the way, moving day was on a Wednesday. We weren't going to be able to get into our new building until Monday. That meant we either had to use up vacation days or work in the conference room of some other facility. I tried the conference room, but as it wasn't connected to the network I needed, I couldn't do much. I had to borrow a couple of vacation days from the next year to make up the time (thanks, jerks).

When Monday came, we could at least get into the building. The cafeteria wasn't open, the fitness center wasn't open, the parking lot wasn't completely paved, and not all the cubicles had power. But they at least made sure the security system was in place and working before putting the classified stuff inside, right?

The job was mostly going to be creating bristol board posters and creating several written documents but fortunately my new boss purchased a laptop specifically for my position.

I quickly found out that my not really tech-savy new boss had overestimated my workload so I was frequently left to do ""research"" on the new computer. Normally this would just be permission to slack off but since the computer didn't have an internet connection, my entertainment options were limited.

Pinball either didn't work or wasn't on there, Solitaire quickly became boring, I taught myself how to minesweeper for a few days, and Microsoft Word's Clippy became my only company.

Eventually I decided I would try to take up as much space as possible on the computer by creating a folder, copying the folder multiple times, zipping the copied folders, and repeating. I would also occasionally give the files a random extension so anyone else using the computer wouldn't prematurely delete my cartoon monstrosity before I had a chance to fill up the PC. Dumb, I know, but after a few days of realizing how big it was getting it became a mildly entertaining challenge. 

Near the end of my job I had managed to fill up about 75% of the laptops memory with my giant garbage file and was feeling rather accomplished. Unfortunately my boss saw how bored I was and found some field work for me to do to finish out my job. The work was distracting enough that I had completely forgotten about the garbage file.

Around two years later I was visiting home and I bump into my old boss. We have a chat and eventually she mentions how her work laptop wasn't working. Being the resident nerd in town I offer to give it a once over. I show up to her house and see that it's the same laptop I had used and remember my giant garbage file. I delete the file, restart and see the computer is running properly and feel horrible that my little bit of entertainment had been slowing her computer down so much this whole time. I proceed to do an honest check up (Cookies, updates, defragmented, virus scan) since I feel I owe her and she thanks me for ""souping up"" her computer.

Wasteland was where I first had to deal with honest-to-goodness classified stuff.

Like everything else in the industry, classified information was compartmentalized as heck and very very specific. This was partly due to the fact that safeguarding classified stuff is expensive, time-consuming and a pain in the ass. So they'd want to save the effort for places where it would actually be worth it.

Consider, as a totally made-up example, a new model of tank with a cosmic-ray antenna. The existence of the antenna, or its height would likely not be classified, at least not after the tank was deployed. It's made to be used on an open battlefield, where anyone with eyes can see it. Keeping the existence of the antenna classified would not be useful. If another country learned about the tank, nothing much would be at risk.

However, the fact that it detects cosmic rays and the range it can detect is another story. If an enemy found out this, they'd be able to figure out how to avoid detection, or counteract it. This is the kind of thing that gets classified.

But, the compartmentalization also goes the other way, for lack of a better analogy. Given the above scenario, a photo of the tank would not be considered classified, even if it showed the antenna, but a user manual with a chapter detailing the care and maintenance of the antenna would. And even though only a small part of the manual contained classified information, its presence would render the entire document classified, regardless of the content of the other pages.

Another bit of background. In between NotRockets and Wasteland, I'd decided to go to grad school and get a MS. In Defense (at least in AquVille), if all you have is a BS, your resume's just another one on the pile, and I figured it would help me find a job. At this point, I was still in classes. Wasteland was generally pretty cool about this. My schedule was pretty flexible and they either didn't know or didn't care that I was doing my programming homework on company computers.

So one day, I needed information from a particular document to finish a project. This document was classified, and as such, was kept in a safe. Although I had the required security clearance and need-to-know to see the doc, I didn't have access to the safe. That meant my boss had to get it out for me. It should be noted that this 40-someodd-page document only contained 2 pages of classified data, and the info I needed was on one of the unclassified pages. If we continue the tank example, what I needed would be the paint color- not classified, and only tangentially related to anything that is. But, like above, those two pages rendered the entire document classified. I'd suggested only taking the pages I needed, or leaving the 2 classified ones in the safe, but that wasn't an option.

I got the info I needed and finished my task, and then it was time to return the doc to the safe. But there was a problem. My boss had gone home, and I didn't have the safe combo. Further complicating things was the fact that I had a class to get to- and an exam that period (and to complete the cliche pile, it was an open-book exam and I'd left my book at home). I had to leave, and that meant I had to get that document out of my hands.

Leaving it out and just leaving was out of the question- classified stuff must either be locked up or in someone's custody at all times. And since I couldn't split up the document, I still had those two classified pages. I had to leave and leave soon, and that meant I had to find somebody- anbody- to take this thing off my hands.

Miraculously, I found someone, about 10 minutes before class started. I made it to my exam, only a little bit late. There wasn't time to go get the book, but I passed, anyway.

And frustratingly, it took another couple of years before they decided to give me the safe combo, so this scenario was repeated a few more times.",2017-06-02 09:48:43
No good deed goes unpunished,55,6els3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6els3j/no_good_deed_goes_unpunished/,4,1496311633.0,"I'm now working in Project Management but spent the first few years working in Operations for financial services companies. My first job in a large FI was in an Ops centre 1 town over from my childhood home. I have to be slightly vague about what this centre did so apologies if anything seems unclear.

Over time working there, I moved into a specialist role but would still provide cover in other sections as in the 2 years I was there I had been trained or trained myself on just about every role in the centre. One day they decided to move me back into a mail room style manual role with 0 warning and unfortunately my back started giving me trouble. I ended up being seconded (so they didn't have to deal with me) into a role in London that interacted with my centre and apart from the commute, was a great move for me.

Because I still had to have regular updates with my original Line Manager they arranged it so I could work from that home centre a couple days a week to spread the burden of the commute.

So that's the scene set. 3 months into this arrangement it's December and the weather decides to cover the South of England with Snow - if you know us Brits this means we grind to a complete halt. Living just under 4 miles away and having a pretty urgent deadline for my new role and no way to tele-commute I decide to walk it in knee high snow as it's not save to drive and none of my buses are running.

I get into the centre and the duty manager is having kittens. Most of the centre staff, despite living locally, took it as an excuse to have a day in bed. In the particular field this centre worked, there were certain legal requirements that needed to be completed. Some areas you could shut down for the day, and apart from a backlog, they'd be fine but some things needed to be done same day and reported to various parts of the FI.

So little old me shows up and this manager begs me to help her keep the centre open. I get it cleared with my secondment manager over email (after the centre manager begs her) and get to work. A couple hours later I've put out most of the fires and one of the ""golden boy"" management prospects drops by the office. He asks if I can forward an urgent message  so I type it up neat and forward the scan across to the central team so they have both. Now this information went to a senior team in the FI and it turned out golden boy hadn't checked his data.

I find this out when one of our area managers rings me up and literally screams down the phone at me, effin' and blinding, really giving me the hairdryer treatment while I try and interject and tell him what must have happened. He won't have any of it and apparently it's my fault for not double checking it. Eventually the duty manager takes the phone and finishes the call and we get the instructions to fix it.

This is one of those memories where you wish you knew then what you know now. I know with 100% certainty I'd have had him rolled over by HR and fucked out the other side. Sadly he got away with it.

In the meantime the weather is getting worse and the executive decision is taken to close the centre at 4pm so I put my boots back on and trudge the 4miles home (incidentally passing one of the managers whose job I'd covered - they were sledding...).

A couple weeks later I find out through the local comms that everyone who came into the centre that day is being nominated for outstanding service and given shopping vouchers. Everyone except me. Apparently the Centre Manager, who was the closest I've come to a real female David Brent, didn't want to stir things up with the area manager and deliberately excluded my name.

TLDR: Trudge miles uphill (both ways) in neck high snow to heroicly keep financial services centre open only to be cruelly shouted at for someone elses mistake then left out of the awards for keeping the centre running.

It's going to have more stories than most, because I was there about twice as long as most other projects. And that was twice as long as I should have been there, at least.

The project I was hired for was the other huge, long-running missile system, which I'll call **Stonehenge**.

But first, SWAG ROUNDUP! Wasteland won't win any prizes for quantity, but they did bring the weird stuff. 

First, a box on a lanyard. What is this supposed to be used for? Is it for ID cards? Disks? These were given out at some ""safety"" demo, and apparently, it's meant to be a ""first aid kit"". The ""kit"" consisted of some bandaids, wet wipes and packets of off-brand aspirin. Maybe that's all you'd need in an office?

And then the set of jumper cables. Technically, that wasn't from Wasteland itself, but one of the insurance companies they'd contracted with for employee benefits. They had all the companies come and give a spiel about why we should pick them, and one of them held a raffle. I won a ""car safety kit"", the only really useful part of which was the jumper cables. Not bad, though. I needed a set.

And the rest of the stuff: A baseball cap with the Stonehenge logo, a metal pin with the same, a fleece jacket (nice!), a stress ball in the shape of a brain, at least one polo shirt, still more lanyards, a really nice refillable metal pen, a hand sanitizer bottle on a clip, and a (probably imitation) leather folder that I still use to keep resumes in.

Yes, I keep all my logo swag. It's all in a RockeTech tote bag I got during an interview there. We'll hear about RockeTech, later.

Although I'd had to get a security clearance to work at NotRockets, I'd never had to deal with actual classified stuff there. That changed at Wasteland. The software we were working on wasn't classified, but the special hardware it was intended to run on was. That required our closed area to have something unusual: a vault.

Yes, a vault. Metal walls with EM-blocking insulation and a door like you'd find in a bank. My boss had to lock it up at the end of they day, since none of the rest of us had the combo. That's in addition to the closed area itself, by the way (which I still didn't have the ability to open and close on my own). The ruggedized laptops we ran our tests on were kept inside, with no connection to the outside network, or even anything in the rest of the closed area. This meant that if we wanted to install something or copy files over, we had to burn it on a CD and physically carry it in. I had to do that with some test files once- a whopping 100kb. What a waste of a CD.

The reason for this setup was so you couldn't get any classified stuff information *off* the machine. Only media that was physically prevented from being written to was allowed to be mounted on it. No USBs, no floppy disks (those were still a thing), no writable CDs. Classified stuff gets weird like that- if one were to put a writable disk or thumb drive in the machine, that media would then become classified, due to the possibility that something got copied over. The get it back down to normal, it would have to be completely wiped and then inspected by someone with more authorization than me.

""Ruggedized"", by the way, basically means armor-plated. These things were meant to be used in active combat zones. They had thick metal plating and were heavy as a motherfucker. Later in the project, we got to mess with the actual combat hardware and there were ruggedized folding chairs. Armor-plated folding chairs! Surprisingly comfy, too.

Also, the Stonehenge logo used as a background image looked suspiciously like a marijuana leaf. Probably not intentional, but when you're stuck by yourself in a chilly, creepily quiet room, that kind of thing seems funny.

A while after I joined, Wasteland moved to another facility, and a paper company ended up in the space we left. I still wonder what they did with that vault.",2017-05-31 07:48:04

---

As was common in the early '00s, Monolith got its budget cut. And once again, I was cannon fodder. I, and a group of others the Monolith project couldn't afford to keep, ended up on a project I'll call Purgatory.

I call it Purgatory for two reasons. First, because it was allegedly dying, scheduled to be either replaced by or absorbed into Monolith. I say ""allegedly"" because even now, 10+ years later, I still come across job listings looking for experience with it. For all I know, it could still be shambling along like a government-funded, missile-launching zombie. It wouldn't be the first or the last project to end up in undead project limbo.

Second, because, as the project was dying, it was where NotRockets dumped all the people who weren't valuable enough to keep on Monolith, but not quite useless enough to lay off, completely. Purgatory's management was exactly as thrilled as you might think to be saddled with Monolith's rejects, and didn't bother to hide it. Morale, not just among us rejects, but in the project as a whole, was somewhere between negligible and nonexistent. No one- not us, not management, not NotRockets, gave a single solitary crap about Purgatory, making it a... well, let's call it an ""interesting"" experience.

First, the facility. While Monolith was run out of NotRockets' main Aquville facility, Purgatory was relegated to a satellite office in a low-rent office park. We shared the building with a questionable telemarketing firm. The parking lot was partially blocked off with weirdly-situated concrete barriers that had obviously not been part of the original design. I assumed NotRockets put them there as a post-9/11 security thing (the main facility had blocked off and removed the ""executive"" parking lot because it was right next to the building, and considered a security risk), but I went for an interview in that complex recently and the things were still there. There was no signage, except the probably-obligatory one at the office park entrance. Nothing on the walls besides some Purgatory-specific publicity diagrams that were probably years old. For comparison, Monolith's offices were festooned with company propaganda posters, pictures and awards from previous projects and borderline-schmaltzy ""Respect Our Troops"" posters.

The offices were windowless, with cheap paneling and ancient carpet. The cubicles in the back, where us rejects were seated, were badly painted relics left over from a previous tenant. Dead roaches in the hallway were a regular occurrence. Once, we had to evacuate the building because the AC motor was burning oil and filled the place with smoke. The electric lock on the door to the classified offices had a habit of failing, which, at least once, resulted in the entire classified staff being locked out when it failed while they were all in a conference room. It was a cheap, crappy place, is what I'm saying.

The computer setup was also cheap. Like always, the project was compartmentalized as hell, and there had to be measures in place to make sure none of Purgatory's files or data were ever in the same place as any of NotRockets' other projects. Not an uncommon setup, but in every other case, the cubicles had two terminals, one connected to the network for one project, and one for the other. Purgatory couldn't afford this, especially not for the Monolith rejects. Instead, our computers had switchable hard drives. If I wanted to fill out my timecard or check my non-Purgatory company email, I had to exit out of what I was doing, power down the computer, switch the HD and start back up.

And, of course, it had a Closed Area. And there is where the true depths of NotRockets' apathy was most apparent. Like at Monolith, we weren't allowed to leave the lab unlocked and unattended, and again, I wasn't important enough to be granted the ability to lock it up on my own. The same policy as Monolith held- if you couldn't lock up yourself, you had to call security to do it for you. Fortunately, it was only a single room and our actual offices were outside, so there was no cubicle odyssey at the end of the day. Unfortunately, the crappy satellite office had no security person. We had to call security back at NotRockets' main facility, who would then drive over to the satellite facility to lock the door once he was able. If we were lucky and we caught him while he was at his desk, we might be able to get out of there in ten or twenty minutes. If he was out on patrol or in the mens' room, we were stuck waiting until he got back and hoping we didn't miss him. And no, he had no cell phone, at least not that they gave us the number for.

This cauldron of apathy and despair gave rise to the two most WTF things I've ever put on my resume. The first wasn't all that weird, on the surface. A simulation utility that had been developed in-house needed a user manual, as no one really knew how to use it. Management put this project out on the shelf for anyone who wanted to take a shot at it to pick up, but no one wanted anything to do with it. Eventually, I ran out of things to do and got so achingly bored that I decided to give it a try. After all, I'd written my fair share of video game walkthroughs. This couldn't be that different, right? The result was... well, I hesitate to call it good, but it was the best that could be achieved under the circumstances.

Yet again, the developers unavailable. They had left no documentation whatsoever, and this time, we didn't even have access to the source code. What exactly were we supposed to document? The only thing I could think to do was go through all the commands and menu options and recording what they did. Was it useful? I don't know, but at least we could say we had some documentation and I could put ""writing user manuals"" on my resume and technically not be lying.

But the real WTF on my resume? **""Translating Python code to C++""**.

The programming peeps reading this probably all just went ""buh?"", and recruiters probably thought I was padding my resume, but I assure you, it was a real project. Management actually assigned it to me, and I got paid real money to do it. I spent a week or so teaching myself Python from a book borrowed from Main Dev, and another week slogging through his uncommented, barely-readable code. He did not take my advice from the last chapter. He really liked reusing variable names, too, which caused some confusion (Python is untyped, C++ is strongly typed. In Python, you can have a variable containing a string, then put in a number or an object pointer. You can't do that in C++). Is this variable 'x' the same one that was used as an array iterator 10 lines ago, and if so, why are you trying to assign a string to it? But I did it, and as far as I know, it worked. Yay, me.

But... why? Truth is, I still don't know. The official story I got was that the Main Dev insisted on doing everything in Python. As my programmer peeps are probably itching to point out, Python is an interpreted language, and therefore too slow to be any use on a real-time simulation, so it needed to be translated to C++. I suspect that the real reason was busy work. Management knew the project was dying and we'd all by laid off soon, and was just keeping us busy and running out the clock.

I kept that on my resume for a while, if only because I enjoyed the confused reaction it got. Eventually, I took both WTF's off, partly because I needed the space for more recent and relevant things, and partly because I got tired of lazy recruiters calling me because their keyword search suggested I might be a great fit for a Senior Python Developer position, despite the fact that I haven't touched Python in ten years.

Only a couple of months after the two WTF's, Monolith got its budget cut again. This time, NotRockets remedied this by dipping into Purgatory's budget, which meant us rejects were out for real. This was my first time being laid off, so I was panicking. Little did I know how quickly it would become old hat.

Purgatory epilogue:

Purgatory is, surprisingly, not yet dead. According to the security person at NotRockets I recently talked to, they still have ""a whole 2 people"" working it. I feel for those people.

I got offered my first job at NotRockets while I was still doing my undergrad degree. They invited a herd of us out to their HQ near DC for interviews, and a bunch of us got offered jobs after we graduated (The late 90s/early 00s were a different time, kids). My offer letter stated I'd be working with **Manager A**.

6 months later, graduation is looming, and I confirm with NotRockets that I'm still coming. They send me an updated letter, telling me my tentative start date, and to report to **Manager B**.

A month or so before graduation, I start to make preparations for moving to DC, including applying for apartments. One of them wanted the name of my manager so they could verify employment. I give them Manager B's info. A few days later, they call me back, and said that Manager B has *retired*. I contact NotRockets, and they give me the name for **Manager C**. I forward this to the apartment complex, and get the apartment.

After finally getting to DC and starting at NotRockets, I am assigned to **Manager D**. I don't know what happened to Manager C.

Three months in, Manager D gets promoted. His people are reassigned to **Manager E**.

Another four or five months in, they powers that be decide that Manager E's group is too big, and splits it in half. My half is reassigned to **Manager F**.

So far, 6 managers in about 18 months.

…And then, after 9-11 caused the government to basically drop our project like a hot potato (it was an *air traffic control* project, of all things), I transferred to the ""Space Systems"" division, under **Manager G**.

Manager G is transferred to another project and **Manager H** takes over.

Then, I'm transferred to a different project (spoiler alert!) under **Manager I**.

I'm gonna try to do these in mostly chronological order, although I may end up fudging things.

The year is 2002. The economic aftereffects of 9-11 have killed the project I was working so hard and so suddenly that it left skidmarks. Everyone, and I mean *everyone*, was scrambling to find a job somewhere. With not much choice in the matter, I ended up taking a position in AquVille, for the ""Space Systems"" division of the company. I'd taken the job with this particular company in the hopes of eventually working on the space program, so that seemed like a step in the right direction. AquVille has a NASA facility and the company at least had the word ""space"" in it. It seemed like an improvement.

Then I got to AquVille and discovered that the ""Space Systems"" division actually makes missiles. *sigh*

I shall, therefore, call this company **NotRockets**.

The project NotRockets transferred me to was one of two huge, long-running missile system projects that every major player in AquVille, and most of the minor players, has or had a piece of. I'll call it **Monolith**. This was my first defense project and my first exposure to the ""joy"" of working in a closed area.

First, a little background on just what I mean by ""closed area"". The thing about defense projects is, they're compartmentalized as all hell. There's a thing called ""need to know"". If you don't have a ""need to know"" for a project, you're not allowed to see anything relating to it, even if you have the required security clearance. Some take it a step further, putting measures in place to make sure none of Project A's information or documents are ever physically in the same place as Project B's. This could be locked file cabinets, separate computer networks, and in one particularly annoying case, switchable HDs. Closed areas are an area that is only accessible by people working on a given project. Sometimes this includes an even more closed area for classified things. Sometimes offices are inside the closed area, sometimes just the workstations. In most cases, they are not allowed to be left unattended. Someone must be inside, or the door must be locked. This becomes a problem as they don't give the door codes out to just anyone, and bathrooms are not always part of the design.

Monolith's closed area was, as I later found out, unusually large. Our offices were inside, in several rooms and hallways. We had a big oversize keychain that was the ""token"". If you had the token and needed to leave, you had to find someone else inside the closed area to pass the token to, or lock it up (or call security to do it for you if you don't have the clearance to do it). As my hours were often later than most, this usually resulted in having to go on an odyssey among the labyrinth of cubicles to find the next unlucky token holder when it was time to go home. That was rarely successful, so I was on a first-name basis with the security guards by the time I left.

Monolith was where I picked up my seething hatred of undocumented and unreadable code. Like any well-run project, there were procedures developers had to follow, which included code style guidelines and a comment header template that was required to be included in any source code file. The header was meant to do some of the work a version control system would have done (this project didn't have one, oddly) and have important information about the file, including who wrote it, its update history, its intended purpose, and what data its functions took in and returned. What the guidelines apparently *didn't* specify was that the header had to be filled out. When I finally dug into the code, I found the header dutifully included in every code file- completely empty.

This was a problem. Being a relative noob, they only assigned me to test and debug code written by other team members. But, being a noob, I didn't always understand what it was trying to do, and when this happened, I tried to find out what the deal was from the others who worked on it. That turned out to be impossible, more often than not. In what I soon learned was true defense contract fashion, the original authors of the code were universally off on other projects or even other companies, and unavailable. Defense, as an industry, still has not gotten the memo that retaining your project expertise is a sound investment.

Side note to my programmer peeps: Please document your code. Please. Get into that habit early. I know it's boring, but someday, someone other than you is going to have to read it. Maybe your teacher, your coworkers, or future-you who has forgotten what past-you was trying to do. This someone can't see into your head and might not be as experienced with the codebase as you. It doesn't have to be huge, expansive headers. Put comments explaining what you're doing, and use variable names that actually mean something. Please. Past-Aqu will thank you.

What really made my time at Monolith memorable, however, was the HR department. It's not unusual at all for a company to have little celebrations for major holidays. Cake and punch for the 4th of July, maybe a big institutional-food spread somewhere between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Some organize little events for the employees, like a picnic (if the budget is up to it) or a potluck (if it isn't). They know that if employees feel like the company sees them as people and not just cogs in the machine, they'll be happier and work harder. It's fake, of course. We know it's all fake. They know we know it's fake. But they make the effort and we pretend to be impressed. Plus, HR will take pretty much take any excuse to have food catered in on the company's dime, and I, for one, have no problem with that. Free food is free food.

NotRockets' HR department, however, took this to truly insane levels. Keep in mind that all these happened in the space of a little more than a year.

First, the insane amount of logo swag they handed out. Any time a group of employees were gathered together, there was usually loot to be had. Mostly decent stuff, too. Take the new hires out for a get-together? Have a bag! All-hands meeting to discuss the year's projects? Have a notepad! Another all-hands meeting to announce budget cuts and potential layoffs? Have a stress ball!

During my stay there, I snagged a leather card holder, two CD holders, three mugs (one metal, one ceramic, one plastic), a gym bag (which I'm still using), at least one T-shirt, a paperweight, a plaque commemorating reaching a project milestone that mostly happened before I started there, more pens than I can count, a plastic slinky, a metal slinky (which one of my asshole officemates stole), a stress ball in the shape of a globe, a couple of binders, some lanyards, and a giant stack of personalized notepads. Giant. I mean, the stack was about three feet high, and that's not an exaggeration. I kept them when I left NotRockets, and I still haven't used them all up, even 10+ years later.

For Cinco de Mayo, they had one of the local Mexican restaurants bring in food. Nothing unusual there. But they also set up a cartoon-""Mexican"" backdrop, complete with a cactus and a burro, and had everyone unfortunate enough to walk through the front door that morning photographed in front of it wearing a giant sombrero and holding a sign with our name on it. I don't know what they did with the pics, but the did give us copies of ours. I suspect HR was stockpiling blackmail material. I think I still have the picture somewhere. No, I will not be posting it.

For Black History Month, they brought in fried chicken. **From KFC.** Yes, I'm serious. No, they really had no idea why the rest of us were either trying not to laugh or awkwardly not making eye contact. Alas, there were no collard greens or watermelon to be had.

Valentine's Day meant crate upon crate upon crate of little boxes of valentine hearts. Literal crates, just left on a table in the lobby for people to take. I can't decide if that's more or less awkward than having your boss give them to you. And seriously, where did they get them all? They must have needed a forklift to bring them in.

For St. Patrick's Day, a mountain of green cupcakes. Again, where did they get them all? They must have cleaned out every bakery in the city. How did they explain the radioactive green tinge of the sewage the next day?

But the most batshit of all? A **Rennaissance festival**. Yes, I'm serious. An honest-to-goodness (attempt at a) Ren-fest. They went all-out, too, or as all-out as you can go when your ren-fest is set in a modern office building and parking lot. They hired actors in costume to play characters and had some people put on a sword-fight. It probably would have been fun, anywhere else. Yet, somehow the fact that the supposedly medieval actors were still surrounded by posters of modern missile systems and a missile launcher in the parking lot, and all the patrons were wearing office-casual, somehow killed the mood. I think they should have at least dressed the missile launcher up as a catapult.

But, alas, the economic downturn continued on. Monolith got its budget cut, which resulted in a bunch of us being transferred elsewhere. This, I would soon learn, is par for the course in this industry.

Am I really being stalked right now?,29,6d6122,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6d6122/am_i_really_being_stalked_right_now/,4,1495670014.0,"This happened about a month ago and it honestly scared this shit out of me. This is incredibly long and I apologize.

I work overnights in a manufacturing company. It's just me and one other person in the entire building for 10 hours. Usually, this job is incredibly meticulous, but it doesn't bother me. I just grab parts from the machines and send a new job. 

One night, I get a message on Facebook from some random guy in another state asking me for nudes in a rather explicit way. This guy has 0 mutual friends with me. Mind you, I'm a guy, married to a woman, and my Facebook doesn't reflect where I work. So I do what any sensible person would do and I reply, ""Whoa, whoa. I'm not interested. Who are you? How did you find me""? 

As soon as I responded to him, I started going through is wall. I'm not kidding you, every single post was from Murder Mystery and Crime Scene Investigation scenes. Loads of them. Every. Single. One. I could feel a subtle flicker of concern starting to form in the back of my mind. Normally, I'd just chalk this up as a weird experience and move on. Less than a minute had passed since my reply to this guy and I'm going through countless murder mystery/crime scene game posts looking for something a little less creepy... and I hear the loud, piercing sound of glass shattering.

I've never heard the phone ring where I work before. It's 3am, I'm sitting literally 1 foot away from this phone and NOBODY calls my department, but APPARENTLY someone has a sadistic sense of humor to set the ringtone to the sound of FUCKING EAR-BLEED INDUCING GLASS SHATTERING NOISES. I look at the caller ID and normally, you'd expect to see a regular phone number or ""Unidentified"", ""Blocked"", ""Restricted"", ""Unknown Caller"", etc. No. This read, ""Anonymous Is Here"".

First, my department isn't listed in the system when it spits out departments when you call my work. You have to KNOW my extension to get my department, which, and I'm not even kidding, is extension 666. My coworker looked at me and said, ""Are you okay""? The color in my face had apparently voided itself from existence and I was a slate of pure white. He motioned to pick up the phone and I begrudgingly grab it and give the default prompt, ""Business Name, Department, This is my name"". On the other end, I hear breathing. Slow, wheezy breathing. I prompted again. This time, I hear a quiet chirp. Not a bird, or a cat. Of a human. Like the quiet sound of someone saying ""Oh, shit,"" under their breath. Then they hung up. I hang up the phone and look at my coworker and said, ""I'll be back in a minute"". 

Fellow smokers will understand that when you go through a stressful situation, your first instinct is to smoke to calm down. So, that's where I was going. Half way down the stairs, I came to the interesting hypothesis that I may be being stalked. When I reach the doors to leave the building, I did a quick survey of the parking lot. The parking lot at my work is completely fenced off. To get into the facility, you need a gate code. Only a handful of people have a gate code. But lo and behold, there's a 3rd FUCKING VEHICLE SITTING IN THE FUCKING PARKING LOT! No, this wasn't just any vehicle. It was a black van. Of course. Why would it be anything else at this point? I couldn't. I couldn't do it. I couldn't go outside to have a smoke while my panic neurons are firing at the break-neck rate of train-wreck.

I ran back upstairs and slipped out the back door to have a quick couple puffs and do a little breathing exercises. Was I being stalked? Was this a prank? I go back inside, insistent on not leaving the building again. I locked the doors to my department and waited for the next event that I was sure was going to result in my death. My panic slowly subsided throughout the rest of my shift as nothing else strange happened. I felt relieved when the morning crew started to arrive. 

As I left the building, I briskly walked to my car, got in, and drove home. As I left, I noticed that the black van was still in the parking lot, empty.

The following day when I came to work, I talked to the department head about it and he said, ""Oh, yeah. The CEO is SO open source that our phones need to be open-source. Hackers are constantly giving us hell with 'Phantom Phonecalls'. When I talked to him about it, he just shrugged it off saying, 'Yeah, it happens all the time,' like it didn't even phase him"". 

Am I being stalked? I don't know. Is it likely? No. Was it just coincidence? Probably. Did I shit my pants? Just a little.
Nothing strange has happened on that scale again since I've been working here. I wish someone would have warned me, though. 

TL;DR 
Stalker-ish dude on Facebook with an obsession with Murder Mystery and Crime Scene Investigation games asked me for nudes. I declined and within a minute, my department's phone rang. My department isn't listed anywhere, my Facebook doesn't show where I worked, but someone dialed my work with extension 666 to get to my department, the only department operating this late. The phone sounds like glass shattering and reads out, ""Anonymous is Here"". Nobody answered, but whoever it was made a chirp and hung up. I went to have a smoke and there was a black van in our fenced in, gate code restricted parking lot. I went full panic and about had a coronary. Turns out that my work is obsessed with open source tech and chose hackable phones. The CEO doesn't have an issue with it as far my department lead knows. So this was probably all just coincidence in the worst possible way.",2017-05-25 02:53:34
When you try to make a joke with management and wind up hiding in your cubicle all day of embarrassment.,41,6d46n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6d46n0/when_you_try_to_make_a_joke_with_management_and/,9,1495652047.0,"A while back I worked at a place where the CEO was very nice, but rather intimidating. The guy was always smiling and would frequently swap stories to set people at ease. Unfortunately since I had just started at the company, every time I would clam up faster than a high school boy talking to his crush.

I was planning on being a ""lifer"" at the company so I wanted to make friends with all the important people and that wasn't going to happen if I couldn't say more than two words to one of the heads of the place.

I got my chance one day when coming back from lunch I saw the man himself standing in front of the building obviously waiting for someone.

As I walk past him I build up the courage and tell him ""Don't look so down, people will think you got fired"" or something along those lines. CEO looks at me, laughs, does one of those business guy finger gun gestures and I head inside.

I'd done it, finally broken the ice with the guy. Now I could make the occasional joke in passing or ask him how is day was or anything just like everyone else was doing.

""Bing"" my inbox chirps.

New e-mail from HR.

CEO is no longer with the company, his responsibilities will be divided up between… And that's when I had realized what I'd done. The guy had literally just been let go and was waiting for his daughter to come pick him up. I had probably made what had seemed to be the most insensitive joke at his expense.

Other people who had heard my brief conversation with the now former CEO began giving me dirty looks for my tactless humour as I tried to stutteringly defend myself, I didn't know, I didn't know!

To this day I still cringe whenever I remember it.

**tl;dr** I see our CEO hanging out in the parking lot and make a joke about him getting fired, then read an email confirming I'm a psychic.",2017-05-24 21:54:07
Full Stop,30,6d227f,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6d227f/full_stop/,8,1495631839.0,"This one goes to the last company I worked for.  

**Background:** The company had been doing well for a long time under the wing of this ex-pat who came in from our world headquarters after several CEOs quit/got fired in quick succession over the course of a year (as relayed to me by folks who had worked there long enough).

The new CEO changed up how the U.S. wing ran the organization and things changed for the better.  People were happier, the company was doing well, and we were turning our brands around.  Then we went through a reorg where they let go the head of sales.  The guy was ok at his job, but he was a horrible public speaker and I think the then CEO felt that they needed someone with more public speaking experience.

In comes Roger.  Roger was a sales executive from a big soda company (think Coke or Pepsi).  Roger had hopes becoming CEO of that soda company but I guess he didn't fit the mold so he left the company and came to our organization to head up sales.  At the time our company had split sales and marketing and turned it into three branches: Marketing, Sales, Retail Focus.  I was in the Retail Focus group which involved things like sales analytics, in store merchandising, pricing, etc.

When Roger came in, he made this big speech about how he wants to work with our group and that we need to be working hand in hand with each other, Full Stop... Full Stop...  The man kept saying that word after every sentence. Full Stop.

**Where I inadvertently changed Roger:** In comes a new CEO for our organization, I'll call him Frank (he looks more like a Frank and changing names because).  Frank also came from World Headquarters but his background was more finance focused.  Over the summer the two CEOs were to transition the organization over, Frank to take over from the old CEO and business was to move on as usual.

At the time, our head of Retail Focus, David, had a lot of good ideas on where he wanted to take the organization and his team.  At one point, David had approached me about my ideas for the organization and we got to talking about certain things we were missing and how I could close that gap. I was ecstatic.

About two months later, there's a big announcement from Frank. We're merging Sales and Retail Focus back together and just calling it Sales.  Roger makes his speech again, saying Full Stop after every sentence and this just pisses me off.  David then gets on the phone and tells us all that he's decided to leave the organization.  You could tell he was bitter and pissed.  He had every right to be, considering Roger had been schmoozing it up with Frank and convinced Frank that the organization would be more efficient with Retail Focus and Sales under Roger, which means that David would have to take a step down and Roger would be his new boss.

I and my team had been hearing rumblings from the sales team that Roger was known for being a penny pinching blow-hard that couldn't give you any idea of what he wants beyond he doesn't like it.  As you can imagine, this created a lot of over-work for his team.

Flash forward to a few months later and we're having a team meeting/transition meeting where Brian is taking over for David (Brian was under David but was moving up to take David's spot) and Roger was taking over the team.  The first day, David ran the meeting and talked about how great things were, but by lunch time, he was to walk out and Roger was to take over for the next two days.

When Roger got up to speak, I started tallying how many times he said, you guessed it, Full Stop.  That first half day, he said Full Stop at least 36 times.  The second day, in the morning, he said it again another 42 times.  By this point, I had tallied up that he had said Full Stop 78 times and he wasn't done. In the afternoon he was up to saying Full Stop 120 times.  

That afternoon we did a team rotation where we were going to select a new name for ourselves considering that Roger hated that our team name was Retail Focus.  He said it made us full of ourselves.. ok? I moved to another table completely forgetting the pad I had been using... yep, the tallies of him saying Full Stop.  And guess who happened to be sitting in my spot when we moved? Roger.  He saw the page, blanched, took a picture of it then sighed heavily.  Thank god I didn't put any indication that it was me who had wrote it (we were in a room with over 100+ people, kind of hard to figure out who sat where).

**The Reveal:** Flash forward to 6 months later, I'm in a meeting with Roger, my boss, my boss's boss and another coworker to present this strategy deck we had created. In the middle of the convo, Roger is about to say Full Stop but stops himself and says, ""Man, I've been trying like hell to fight that part, but I just can't help myself from saying it. Back when David left, I found that someone had written down how many times I said Full Stop and it blew me away. I had no idea I said it that much. When I showed my wife, she laughed and confirmed that I say it way too much. Wish I knew who it was.""

I kept my mouth shut and acted ignorant of it but I was thankful that the Full Stops mostly stopped.

I left the company 6 months later after realizing how terrible that place was getting and where it was going.

**TL;DR** Got the head of sales to stop saying ""Full Stop"" after every sentence when he found my tallied notepad.

The 4-month-long Hurry-up-and-wait saga.,36,6cn898,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6cn898/the_4monthlong_hurryupandwait_saga/,5,1495459682.0,"I already posted this story on my blog, but I figured, ya'll would get a kick out of it, too. Behold, the saga of how I got paid to sit on my butt for four straight months.

For background, I was a software developer for a very large defense contractor, which I’ll call Missiles-R-Us. I’d started working there after my previous project dropped me for reasons I never got the details of. Probably budget-related, but who knows? After I started there, I found out that they’d brought on quite a few new people- to replace a whole bunch of other people that had left, all of a sudden. In retrospect, this should have been a huge red flag, but I didn’t see it.

About ten months in, the project I was on had its budget slashed, and my position was one of the ones to go. This, unfortunately, is par for the course in the defense industry. Contracts come and go, and the industry as a whole hasn’t figured on that hanging on to their project experience and subject matter expertise is a good idea. And they never quite make the connection between letting all their expertise get away and the project not being as awesome as it could have been.

Luckily, I was able to find a spot on another project with the same company. This was no thanks to either my HR contact, or my “dedicated placement rep”, I should mention. I still have no idea what either of those people were supposed to do for me, as the only advice they could give me was to check the company’s job listing site. But the new project seemed like it would be fun. The HR person “extends” my layoff date.

The project is based out of a facility in another state, so I and the team I’m with are working for them remotely. The team lead and I are installed in a backwater office near the airport. The other two guys are in other states. I don’t mind the move, as the new office is closer to my house, and the new commute route doesn’t have to go over the then-under-construction bridge. Plus, I get to drive by the intermodal center and watch the huge cranes moving containers around. Yeah, I’m weird. So I liked the new place, but it was still pretty obvious just where in the pecking order we were.

Also, I still report to my old manager from the previous project, at least on paper. I never did find out why this was. It may have been because I was never “permanently” attached to the new projects(s), because the lead on the new project(s) didn’t have the corporate authority to sign timecards and such, or maybe there was a policy that employees and their managers had to be in the same geographic area. I don’t know, but it was weird.

So I set about learning a new software language and a new dev framework for this new project. I’ve never used either, before, so the only thing they assign me are tutorials and non-SW-related research, figuring I’ll get up to speed in a couple of weeks. This isn’t the most organized of groups. The project is new and in its very, very early stages, no one knows exactly what they’ll end up doing, there are basically no SW requirements or plan, and everyone being in different states isn't helping. We’re fumbling in the dark. But it looks interesting, and at least I’ll pick up some more bling for the resume.

A couple of weeks in, the higher-ups decide (rightly, IMHO. The first group was mainly UI-focused, and my skills are data/backend-focused) that my skills are a better fit for a different group within the same project, and I am transferred there. This happens without notifying either the group lead for the group I was with, or my manager-in-name-only, resulting in some confused emails. HR again “extends” my layoff date.

But this new group looks better! The work is right up my alley, and since it’s in its very very very early stages, I might get to take a leadership role in the development of my piece. I get excited.

Ah, but there’s a problem. The work for this new group requires installing some new software on my company machine. Most of it’s routine- updated Java, Firefox, etc.- but the company machines are so tightly locked down that the regular users can’t install a thing. For some of the software, they can supposedly be ordered from the company’s internal SW store, and IT will install it for you. I do this for the things I can order there and wait.

But for the rest, like the DBMS, I need either a waiver or admin access on my machine. I apply for both of these, aand wait. I send paperwork to my manager-in-name-only. When nothing happens, I send it again. When still nothing happens, I get in touch with his manager, the project lead, the engineering lead, trying to fight my way up the chain so I can get this nonsense installed.

But I can, for some reason, install Eclipse and JBoss (no, I don’t know why), so I can at least look around in the code, maybe do some testing that doesn’t require the DB? There isn’t much that falls into that category, since the DB and the layer that accesses it are basically my entire job, but there ought to be something. Nope. The JBoss version they use needs a later version of Java, which I can’t install! I can look, sure, but I can’t run it or do anything useful.

If you’re wondering why I didn’t already have a dev environment set up, it’s because the first project did all its actual dev work on classified machines connected to their classified network. I’d already gone through the bureaucracy red tape to get that set up, and the unclassified company laptop was really only used for email and timecards. Oddly, the classified machine setup actually involved less red tape, as the environments were standardized and the contents largely contract-mandated. Also, the admins that handled the classified network were there onsite, so we could bug them in person.

One of the waiver requests is rejected by IT, because I do not have a waiver for the software requested. No, I don’t understand it, either. The request is resubmitted.

Two weeks later- *TWO WEEKS LATER*- still nothing. I get on IT’s case about the stuff I ordered from the internal store, and am informed there was a server issue and orders got lost. I reorder them, and wait.

Then I start climbing the bureaucracy chain again, trying to chase down either the admin access or the SW waivers. This time I am able to use the magic words- “Work Stoppage Issue”, which apparently gets them moving. Gears of bureaucracy turn, albeit ponderously. My admin access miraculously comes through! The waiver requests are never heard from again, and the SW store’s server apparently never found my orders after its ‘issues’, but with my shiny new admin access card (yes, a physical card. Our ID badges had chips in them, and they had to install some certs on it.) , I can finally install all my stuff and actually get some work done!

It’s been close to a month, at this point. Between this and the disorganized clusterfuck going on in the first group, Missiles-R-Us has basically been paying me to twiddle my thumbs for almost 2 months. Don’t get me wrong, data security is a good thing. You don’t want employees installing porn and malware on the company machines, especially since there’s government data on them, and a slight chance there might even by legitimately classified data, too (there shouldn’t be any on these machines, ever, but breaches happen). But when it gets to the point where it’s actively preventing people from doing their jobs, maybe you need to lighten up on the red tape. Seriously, if you won’t let a Java developer install Java…

About a week later, on a Tuesday, I get a message from the manager of another project, wanting to know if I’m available. It gets me thinking- it was getting to the end of my layoff extension, and I hadn’t heard from HR about extending it again. My last day was the coming Monday. On Wednesday, I get to work to find a voicemail from my manager-in-name-only, saying I need to come fill out the final layoff paperwork.

…What?

I frantically chase down the team leads, the managers, the HR reps, trying to find out what the flaming crap is going on. At last, I get a hold of the team lead. Apparently, they’d decided to get rid of not just me, but all the people in the group I’d just left. The requirements and specs for our parts of the project weren’t yet developed enough to justify having someone on them full-time.

Gee, thanks for the heads-up, jerks. When were you planning on telling us? At least on the first project, they gave us 6 weeks notice.

But there’s light on the horizon! The other project that contacted me! I’ll just get a hold of that guy and see if I’m a good fit there!

…Aaaaaand, there’s a problem. The email was sent via the company’s internal job/resume-search site, and it hadn’t included the name or email of the sender. Basically “Hey, we need a programmer for a remote project in City X. Wanna talk?”

So I email my HR rep, hoping she’d know who sent it. But, not wanting to wait, I decide to hunt it down on my own. I look up project managers at the site mentioned (fortunately, it wasn’t one of the larger ones) and send a generic “Hey, was this you?” email to some of them. After a couple of leaps, it ends up in the hands of the original sender, and we start talking. But he’s going out of town tomorrow, and wants to set up an interview for next week.

Next week? My last day is Monday! Can we move faster? He contacts some other team members to see if they can do it. One of them IMs me and tells me about the project, and I’m absolutely drooling. Not only is it perfect for my skillset, but the subject matter is something I’ve been researching as part of my thesis/dissertation. Seriously, have you read my thesis? It’s totally relevant, and I have a copy here on my handy thumb drive (Don't judge. If you'd spent that much time on something, you'd carry it around, too). She says she’ll email me tomorrow to set up a phone interview.

Thursday. I wait. And wait. I IM the person I’m supposed to be talking to. I wait. I email her. I wait. Eventually, she contacts me. They’re in the middle of a huge demo, and got swamped. No big deal, we can talk tomorrow.

Friday. I wait. I wait. I IM. I email. And frankly, my desperation is showing and I’m not proud of it. At about 4:30, I realize it’s probably not going to happen that day, so I email my HR rep, asking if the layoff date can be extended a few days to get this cloffprunking interview done. The rep has already gone home for the day, so I have to wait until Monday for an answer. Have a good weekend, Aqu!

Monday. The HR rep says they can extend the layoff until Wednesday, but I’ll have to use my PTO time to cover it. That’s rather a dick move, but it beats being unemployed.

No, what a minute. It’s not rather a dick move, it’s *totally* an absolute dick move. I’ve been in that situation before, with other companies, and the other companies always had an overhead charge number we could use for a few days between projects. Fuck you, Missiles-R-Us.

Anyway. Tuesday. The interview finally goddamn happens! And since both I and the HR rep had impressed upon them that they need to move quickly, they make a decision right then. I’m officially transferred to the new project. HR “extends” my layoff date.

Wait, extended again? I thought this was a permanent thing.

Well, I’m working remotely, and they’ve been burned before by people who weren’t able to keep up without their coworkers around. “Died on the vine”, they called it. And they want to make sure I can hack it, and that this project is what I want to do. Not unreasonable, but still irritating. And if I don’t wash out, it should turn permanent. The lead think that’s pretty likely, too. This is hot-topic program that the army’s pretty gung-ho for. They haven’t had a budget problem in five years!

And guess what! I need to install new software! But this time, they know what they’re doing. Instead of wading though the red tape to use the company machines, they have VMs set up for the devs with admin access and everything. I have the tools I need in three days. Yay for organized projects.

So all’s rosy? No, not yet. I’ll have to go to the facility at City X to get completely set up. So we throw around a few dates for this…

…And nothing. The demo is still going on, and they’re still swamped. I keep at it, and eventually, we settle on the next week. All I need to do is go to the company’s travel site and use my company card to make the arrangements…

Wait, company card? What company card? Crap. Let’s get that rolling. It means next week is out, though, as is the week after because of a holiday, and the week after that because both the people I’ll need to work with will be out of town.

That puts the expected date of the trip past my layoff date. So guess what. HR has yet again “extended” my layoff date.

…Sigh.

If you’re counting, that’s about 2 ½ months, so far, they’ve been paying me to basically sit on my butt.

Over the next couple of weeks, I do manage to get a bit of work done. Not much, mind you, but at least I’m not twiddling my thumbs, all day. They even assign me a bug. There’s still the matter of getting access to one of the network systems, but I’m sure that will be taken care of once I can go to City X. 

So, three weeks later, the trip to City X happens. And it actually wasn’t so bad. I finally meet my new coworkers in person, and we get the rest of the tools and systems set up. City X is almost creepily similar to where I live, complete with a cornfield right outside the office building.

But, my last day there, the team lead calls a meeting. He’s gotten word that the project is getting its budget cut.

What? *What!?* Are you fucking kidding me? Supposedly no budget issues for five years, and it gets its budget cut as soon as I get there? Are you fucking kidding me?

Despite the lead’s assurances that they’ve only laid off 2 people in the 19 years he’s worked there (I call bullshit, unless he's been living under a rock), I know I’m toast. Last in = first out in these projects.

It was suggested to me by multiple people that they knew this would happen and only brought me on to be cannon fodder, so they wouldn’t have to lay off someone who mattered. Catch me in a bad enough mood, and I might agree. It’s possible, to be sure, but why go to all that trouble- even setting up a multi-day business trip- if all you want is cannon fodder?

So I go through the motions again, applying for things on the internal job site- and increasingly on outside sites, too. My “dedicated placement rep” continues to be useless. This time, however, there’s nothing for it. My layoff date arrives. I turn in my security badge and the laptop and my still-brand-new company card, and leave. The HR rep says she hopes we’ll work together again, someday. I try very hard not to laugh. Although I’m disappointed at not being able to work on that last project, I do not miss Missiles-R-Us, and I’m not going to miss the defense industry, either.

But it’s not over, yet. Remember the company card? I’d submitted the expense report just before I got laid off, and the HR rep said the company would be paying the card directly, so I didn’t need to worry about it. However, a couple of months later, I start getting calls from the card company- Missiles-R-Us didn’t pay the card. I email the HR rep to find out what’s going on, but never heard back. I was still unemployed, then, and if they thought I was going to pick up the tab for a $1500+ business trip, even I could afford it, they’re nuts.

Another couple of months pass, and the card company is calling again. Seriously, Missiles-R-Us, laying me off wasn’t enough, you have to wreck my credit, too? This time, I email not only the HR rep, but my former manager, the team lead, the admin person who set up the trip, and my boss’s boss. The former team lead actually replies, saying they’re looking into it. I haven’t heard anything else, nor has the card company contacted me, so maybe it’s taken care of. I have no access to the card, and can’t get into the company system to check on the expense report, so I can’t be sure.

---

As an epilogue, after some adventures in consulting and a couple more short-lived projects, I'm back with Missiles-R-Us… kinda. The contract structure for this current project is the most borked thing I've ever seen, but Missiles-R-Us and I are connected, at least tangentially. They have not changed their ways.",2017-05-22 16:28:02
Where do you see yourself going in your second temporary job?,133,6c53gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6c53gj/where_do_you_see_yourself_going_in_your_second/,14,1495214806.0,"So to pay for some unexpected expenses I took a second job as a tech for a retail location. You could say I work with a squad of computer people. 

Well I took this job saying full well it is temporary and that I only wanted the job to help pay off extra expenses. My bosses knew this. My coworkers knew this. Hell even the regional manager knew this. So far everyone has been OK with it and is actually willing to work on me with my schedule. Nights and weekends. 

So a few nights ago we get the new schedule and it shows some morning hours for the weekday. I groan and ask my manager about it. Basically he was told that I need some morning hours for training for a specific role his manager wants to put me in. 

I basically asked him ""what role?"" I reminded him of how I was temporary and that I wanted no advancement or promotion opportunities. My manager gave me a smug ""Oh I think you will reconsider when you see the offer."" I gave him a nice ""don't count on it"" as I walked down to his managers office. 

I walk into his office and ask him about the hours. 

Actors in this scene are 

> $me = Peter Gibbons

> $MGR = Dan (The restaurant manager from waiting...)
 
I walk in and set down at the table in the center of the room. (Managers do not have an office here.) 

> $ME - So what is going on with my schedule? Why are you giving me hours during the day?

> $MGR - Ah $ME good to see you. You want anything? Soda? Water?

> $ME - *instant red flags* No thanks I am good. 

> $MGR - So where do you see yourself going with (our company?)  

> $me - I see myself going back to (my day job)

> $MGR - *Annoying laugh* I thought you might say that. They said you were a jokester. That was a good one. 

> $ME - No. No it wasn't 

> $MGR - Listen there is an opportunity that has come up which I have already put your name in the hat. You know the (name of position that gets paid well... for this company) they have an opening very soon. I know you are about to talk about your commitment to your current company. But do not worry, the position will not be opening up for a few weeks. Plenty of time to square things away. 

> $ME - *I will play along.* Pay, benefits, and hours?

> $MGR - Excuse me?

> $ME - Pay benefits and hours. What are they?

> $MGR - I do not know the full details of the benefits. But the pay is 16 an hour starting out. After every six months you get an employment review where we bump your pay up. 

> $me - *No you wont. You wont give me reviews every six months you will pretend I do not get one and then give me one after 2 years where you bump my pay by 50 fucking cents.* The cap?

> $MGR - Well for this position the cap is 19 an hour. You will be guaranteed 40 a week. Plus I know that we have a week of paid vacation after one year. So are you interested?

> $ME - *If you could double the pay, triple the vacation, and guarantee medical with only a 1.2k deductible sure.* I don't think so. My other job pays me more and we have better benefits. I honestly just came in here so I can get my schedule fixed. 

> $MGR - I think you are making a big mistake. You are throwing away a big opportunity here. 

> $me - Look I was trying to be nice. I make ____ an hour working 8-5 m-f. I get 3 weeks of vacation a year and my health insurance only has a 1.2k deductible. Unless you can beat that I will not be taking the opportunity.

I am currently being groomed and the only reason I took this job was to pay off a debt. Now please fix my schedule. 

The assistant manager grudgingly changed the schedule and told me I had made a big mistake. 

Fast forward to last night. The store manager wanted to speak with me. She sat down with me at the table, handed me a write up, and then asked me one simple question. ""Where do you see yourself going in this company?""",2017-05-19 20:26:46

Most of the calls we receive are users needing their password reset, account unlocked, or a driver installed. This afternoon I answered a call.

>I'm locked out of my computer by someone named *IT guy* and I think thats who is sneaking in at night.

On our systems, when a user doesn't log out of the computer, only that user can log back in unless the computer is restart. The *IT guy* had to visit the computer in person overnight to install a windows update.     I just simply asked her to restart her computer and that fixed the problem.

What she said at the beginning grabbed my attention and before I completed the ticket I asked her to explain ""sneaking in at night.""

Here are the notes I ended up taking in case I had to submit another ticket.

>POC is concerned about frequent unauthorized access in work-space. POC states devices are left on when leaving work and are powered off/ manipulated when
staff arrives. Locks were installed to stop the issue when forks and spoons
were disappearing. Locks had no effect. Somebody then soiled a work chair and put it in the bathroom.

>Recommended to POC to contact manager, Site manager, and Facilities about
the situation.

She explained to me that a couple of months ago she started noticing things being disturbed in the office when they arrived in the morning. It started with computers and fans being switched off over night. Then chairs and the items in the general work space were being rearranged. When utensils like spoons started disappearing they installed locks on some of the doors. The locks did not deter the ""Unauthorized Personnel"".    

One morning they arrived at work. Everything seemed normal until someone walked into the bathroom. Sitting in the center of the tiled floor was an office chair that was delicately described as ""soiled.""

In 7 years my boss has never dealt with anything that crazy. I guess it is all downhill from here.

A summer recycling job made me fear orange soda.,59,6alnoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6alnoj/a_summer_recycling_job_made_me_fear_orange_soda/,10,1494524117.0,"One year in high school I got a summer job working in a recycling centre. It was a great job mostly due to the fact that my boss was a cantankerous old man who loved to talk while he worked. The man could curse a blue streak like nobody's business.

Most of the job was basically sorting people's trash because apparently nobody knows what is recyclable these days (I mean come on, who thinks a diaper is recyclable?) but it was always an adventure and it paid alright.

The recycling centre just barely managed to pay for itself so we were always looking for ways to make some money and the best way to make money in recycling is through aluminum. We would always keep an eye out for that precious metal and would even make occasional trips when we would hear about a large haul in town. One such tip came from a nearby grocery store.

The store had a small warehouse and was always looking to save space. One of the ways they saved space was storing things too many pallets high. At one point someone had stacked two pallets of Orange Soda on top of each other and then put something far too heavy (or incorrectly) on top of it to save space. The heavy item wound up crushing the top pallet causing it to spray orange soda all over the warehouse.

My boss hears about this soda spray and immediately scopes out the place because soda cans are made from aluminum, cha-ching, and is hoping to snatch them up before they're disposed of. I'm not sure why but he was only able to get the bottom pallet grumbling something about the other one already being gone but the store was happy to donate the remaining pallet to us as long as we were willing to haul it on out of there.

This bottom pallet was perfectly fine aside from the fact that the entire thing was coated in sticky soda from the burst one above it so I was given the job of opening each can, emptying the contents, and placing the cans in the crusher we had. Some of the cans were in perfectly fine shape and we were welcome to drink as many as we wanted as long as we didn't take them off of the property. No free soda for home. 

To was plopped down with a bucket and a pair of gloves with a pallet of sticky soda on my right and an empty crusher on my left. The only thing is, have you ever tried to open a can of soda with gloves on? After a while I gave up on the gloves and started opening cans with my bare hands. Unfortunately after a few cans in quick succession my finger was beginning to get sore so I started opening them with my ring finger instead. After a few hours of opening cans I had trained myself to open cans with every finger, even my pinky. This later became a party trick I would do for easy to entertain drunks in college.

The next day I wake up and my hand is killing me. Every finger has little half moon scar/welt in it from opening cans. I'm young and dumb so I go about my day which involves among other things, handling people's trash. I'll save you the gross details but eventually my boss realizes that something serious is going on and rushes me to the hospital. I had gotten quite a nasty infection and after a few days of medication and bed rest I was back fighting fit. Honestly I felt fine the whole time aside from the pain in my hand but I was a lazy teenager and loving an excuse to sleep in.

To this day I'm still not a huge fan of that soda.

**TL;DR** Recycling centre job had me opening an entire pallet of soda which led to an infection and a disdain for orange soda from that day on.

**Bonus side problem!**

I was told to dump the bucket of soda outside since the sugar would ""wreck the pipes"" so every couple of cans I poured it outside. The small pond I created not only killed the grass nearby but also had a similar effect to salting the ground, meaning that nothing grows within a few feet of it to this day.",2017-05-11 20:35:17

We have a massive online database where all the info is stored and people can use our website to buy items.

I started here around ten years ago and was happily working away until we get called into a meeting to inform us of some great news for our company. We're going to improve our website by outsourcing the data entry to a company in India who will enter it for a fraction of the price. (Some of our online items had an all caps auto generated title with no additional information) The time we save will reduce costs, up sales, and assure generous bonuses for all people involved.

The great speech is winning everyone over but I start running through the logical path and start to dread the outcome. If we outsource data entry then we can probably outsource coding. If we outsource coding then we can probably outsource design. If we outsource design we can probably outsource just about anything else. I immediately start working on my resumé as I picture my job being sent overseas.

The six month project wound up becoming a 2 year project that we're still getting echoes of occasionally to this day.

**Some of the highlights:**

- Product bullets, (the bulleted list of specs like this list) all began with the word bullets. We do not sell anything gun related.

- The second language content for our bilingual website being google translated to a third language, causing us to realize they were only doing half the work.

- Instructions taken so literally that the entire content of the page was entered as information which included items such as: Navigation of the supplier page, Header and Footer, and Logos in text form (with image logos being described)

There's more but these are just some that jumped to mind.

The company trashed their hopes of the entirely outsourced website and made use of what they could from the project and have gone back to their roots of honest well paid labour.

The Tattle Tale,20,69eurp,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/69eurp/the_tattle_tale/,4,1493992956.0,"This goes back a while ago at my first company.  You can see my other posts about the same company:

[Slightly Racist Boss](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/68tcge/the_slightly_racist_boss/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

**Background:** Going back to 2008, we had this guy in our office that loved to tattle on everyone. If you came in late, bosses would find out and you'd get reamed. Nobody realized who it was that kept telling the bosses because he was really covert about it, until I fucked up his scheming.

The guy was nice and seeming enough, but there was always something just slightly off about him. He kept to himself a little but he was a hard worker, his girlfriend was in the military and was always abroad so he was usually on his own. He never really went out like the rest of us so we figured he didn't really drink. He had been at the company almost as long as I had and right before I left the company, he was slated to take over my work.  

Here are the players:

* **Tattle Tail:** TT for short, the guy who ratted on everyone

* **Mike:** One of my good friends from the company.  We started living together after about a year and a half.

* **David:** Met him later at a company alumni event, became good friends afterwards.


**The outing:** What he didn't anticipate was what I had left behind in the files. At the time, I had been single and ready to mingle. I had a few girlfriends from time to time but spent a lot of time flirting with random girls online. Due to the nature of our business, this meant I did a lot of it while at work since most of the time I was in the office vs at home.

I was good friends with the IT personnel at the time and so I had open access to my computer. As a result, I was able to download certain programs and files at will without worrying about IT snooping. I had downloaded some *ahem* unsavory images of certain women I had been seeing.

Prior to leaving, I went through my folders on my hard drive and cleaned out anything and everything private, including said files. What I had neglected to delete were the files out on our shared drive. At some point, I must have backed up those files onto there and completely forgotten to dump those from the system; I was in a hurry to get the hell out of there and didn't do my due diligence.

Anyways, so TT starts digging through my files, searching for my work.  I had done a pretty good job in labeling my files, so they were easy to find.  I guess TT decided to dig further and went through *All* of my files.  Lo and behold, he found my stash, even though it was 1 picture, but it was enough to run to the directors and tell on me.

Problem is, I was already gone from the company and everybody had access to the files. Since they really couldn't do anything, TT decided to start a smear campaign against me, using the image as evidence that I was a scumbag.

**Where he failed:** There were several things going against the guy.

1. He wasn't very sociable and had been an outcast from the get go

2. I was still really good friends with a lot of people in that office, including JR.

3. Two of my friends from the office were living with me still.

4. People were leaving in droves at this point so nobody really gave a shit.

Because he started the smear campaign, my roommates alerted me to it as he went around the company telling people I was a sleaze ball. When Mike asked me about the photo, I scrambled to find my portable hard drive of where I kept all of my work files. I found the photo he was referencing. I immediately burst out in laughter.

TT was claiming I had spied on a previous roommate who was quite attractive and had the photo on my personal computer. I had no photos of her, but it was a photo of a girl I met once and had a fling with then that was it. I had completely forgotten about it.

Mike was pulled into the offices of the directors and was asked about the photo. He told them what I had told him. They asked if I was ashamed. Mike goes, ""Not only is he not ashamed of it, but he laughed his ass off when I told him.""

Because it was so blaringly obvious that TT was willing to tell on former co-workers, people started putting two and two together.

**Aftermath:** TT realized his folly and decided that he was done with the place and moved in with his girlfriend where she was stationed.  Eventually he quit the company.

Before that happened, the directors made an announcement that employees were not allowed to store personal information on the networks anymore and that they'd do routine checks for images and documents.

I became a legend because of my reaction. David approached me several years later at an alumni event.  Him and Mike had been talking since we all had left the company so they kept in touch.  Mike asked me about the photo scandal and I started laughing again about it. He relayed to me that when news broke out how I had reacted to the image being found, people had a new found respect for me.

It dawned on me why I started getting more invites for outings after I had left.  I guess I had made an impression there.

It's come to my attention you're not satisfied. 

Something is wrong?  Well then feel free to make a song and dance about it. It could be the exercise you needed. Get it out of your system. 

You want to speak to my manager?  He's the one who hired me and taught me to say  exactly what I just told you. What makes you think you'll have any more luck with him?

You want to raise your voice? Go for it. If it makes you feel powerful,  then it must be the right thing to do. Surely you are representing customers everywhere, and your voice must be heard. 

You want to complain that we never contacted you? I would want to complain that you didn't write your number clearly, but what would that achieve?

You want to sue us? There's a lot of legal fees involved, I hope it's worth it. I won't try to talk you out of it.

You want to go crazy and start flipping tables?  Please do. It's been a while since I've had anything interesting to post about on Facebook. (or reddit) 

But at the end of the day, you can tell all your friends how you 'put me in my place '. But please remember that I'll also be sharing the news with my own friends. 

That's right, we don't feel intimidated, or stressed out or even angry. No, we put all our energy into not letting that small smile slip across our face. 

Yes, as soon as you leave, your visit is going on Facebook. I'm going to go right to the shop next door and tell my mate what just happened. Sometimes he finds it even more funnier than I do.

So thank you for dropping by my shop and making our day.

When Mikey gets food poisoning,16,68uz1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/68uz1b/when_mikey_gets_food_poisoning/,8,1493750009.0,"We all have that one guy who is always down for food. He'll happily eat your leftovers, snatch up any noms that are offered and is generally the ""Give it to Mikey, he'll eat anything"" of the group.

At my company people love doing food related activities. Potlucks every other month. Snacks brought from home. Cookies when you make a trip out for lunch. The whole thing. And Mikey took advantage of all of them.

Right up until about a week ago.

Like most companies ours has a fridge and several people who frequently forget to clean it out. We also have several people who love to remove the dirty containers from the fridge and leave passive aggressive notes next to them.

Mikey heads to the kitchen one of these times to get water and sees that someone must have put the leftovers from a potluck out to share and chows down unknowingly eating several varieties of bad food.

I have no idea why he didn't stop immediately but he somehow managed to make it through three different containers before realizing his error and rushing for the bathroom. If the sounds I heard from there for the rest of the afternoon were any sign then he deserved the next few sick days he took off.

Edit: Just FYI, he didn't actually get food poisoning, just violently ill and took a few days off out of shame mostly. He's since made a few Facebook updates so I know he's ok.

**Update:** My company also brings in a cake whenever an employee has a birthday. Mikey grabbed two portions as well as two handfuls of other snacks that were on the birthday boy's desk. So... no... he hasn't learned anything.",2017-05-02 21:33:29
"Be wary of the ""Talent Factory""",33,68tnb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/68tnb3/be_wary_of_the_talent_factory/,1,1493737479.0,"If you ever hear your company talk about how they're a ""Talent Factory,"" be afraid, very afraid.  I've heard this from three separate companies, and all three times right before the shit hit the proverbial fan. Usually there was increased workloads followed by massive lay-offs/quitting and then followed by merging of roles and people just generally being burned out.

**Story Time:** The first time I heard that word was when I was at my first job as a Market Researcher. This was a few months before I found a new job and left the company. We had a Townhall with a VP of our group. During said call, the VP called our group a ""Talent Factory"" in that we should be proud for the fact that other companies like to steal their employees since they churn out such high quality talent.

Oh how that become so true..  I was part of the first wave of employees to leave the company, if not one of the first people to leave and go elsewhere. A few months after I left, a whole wave of people started leaving. Eventually turn over was so high that the corporate executives started running statistical models to determine which people had the highest probability of quitting the company and going elsewhere.  Part of this was to anticipate who was leaving to back fill roles, but the real reason was to figure out how to coerce employees to stay and if that failed, to fire them and essentially make them unhirable (kind of backwards but not having a job makes companies pass over you).

**Side note:**So why were people leaving in droves? The company wanted to move the entire office into the corporate HQ, which would have increased people's commute and/or require relocation.  On top of this, the company started outsourcing its research services to China and India, which only made things worse.  Ironically, outsourcing modelling seems like a great idea, but in reality it adds a lot more work and increases costs since work constantly has to be re-done.

**Back to the Story:** Eventually, the move happened and those left merged over to HQ. About two years after the move, the entire group was completely dissolved and I believe there's maybe a handful of people still working there from our original group of 50+ people.

In any event, if your company ever utters the fatal words of ""Talent Factory"" know that you're about to hit into a world of chaos and you should start looking elsewhere.",2017-05-02 18:04:39
The *Slightly* Racist Boss,14,68tcge,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/68tcge/the_slightly_racist_boss/,5,1493734270.0,"Sorry for the flooding of stories but I just remembered another one from the time I worked in Marketing Research for a large research company.

**Back Story** This goes back about 8 years ago, after the economic crash of 2008/2009.  This was mid 2009 so things were just ok.  Our company started consolidating offices.  We were stationed in a remote office in Connecticut and our office was getting merged with an office from NY.  They had let go a number of people on the NY office team so they decided to move them to our office. This team handled a different aspect of the business; they primarily focused on our databases and data warehousing.

Our team in market research wasn't what you would call culturally diverse. We had a smattering of different ethnic groups, but we were dominantly white 20 somethings as the company had a habit of hiring recent college graduates and working them to the bone. The NY office was a lot more diverse.

In my previous post, JR had moved back into the office. What I didn't tell you before is that JR wasn't originally born in the U.S. He was born in Greece and immigrated at a young age so English was mostly a second language. If you've ever met someone who speaks greek, they tend to flub english sayings all the time which can cause some hilarity.  One of those times happened during a townhall.

**Story Time** As being in a remote location, we did a townhall in a big conference room. We were often told that we had to be 5 minutes early to any meeting otherwise we would considered to be late. So most of our team was already in the conference room. JR, the database guy from the previous story, one of his underlings, and I were hanging out by the window discussing data issues we were having on a project. Our team started trickling in.

We see a couple people from our NY office walk in but knew that there was more of them. The town hall was set to start in a few minutes but the NY office folks were running a little behind. A black lady from the NY office walks in and JR being JR, yells out loud, ""Where are all the white people at?""

Our entire team erupts in laughter as the black lady gives JR an evil glare. JR is confused, he doesn't understand why we're all laughing. Database guy replys back between giggles, ""You just asked a black lady where all of the white people are at, in a room full of white people."" JR turns beat red, starts telling us to shut up and stop laughing; this just spurs us on even more. JR tries to back pedal and says, ""I meant to say where are all the white plains people at.""  We laugh harder and JR kicks us out of the conference room. The three of us spent a good 20 minutes laughing before we could finally compose ourselves and come back in.

I have a lot more hilarious stories about JR and that company.",2017-05-02 17:11:10
Tried to jump the corporate ladder; get blacklisted,113,68t39r,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/68t39r/tried_to_jump_the_corporate_ladder_get_blacklisted/,5,1493731453.0,"Moved from r/ProRevenge and r/talesfromprintandcopy; not sure if this is a place for it, but felt I wanted to share my story of a crazy co-worker.

**Back Story:** This happened about 10 years ago, when I first moved from my hometown to go work for a giant research company. When I first joined the company, I was assigned to a mentor, we'll call her Melissa.

Melissa had been at the company for a few years and was at a Senior Analyst level and she had been gunning for Manager/Director for some time.  Melissa was a little weird as she always carried around a 1 liter plastic water bottle.  And no, not the hard plastic kind; the kind you buy at a convenience store; maybe evian or something like it.  Anyways, she toted the bottle around every where she went, she was/is slightly neurotic, but the great aspect about her was that she was a fellow nerd and her soon to be husband (John) was a big gaming nerd.  Being that I was new to the area, I soon became fast friends with both John and Melissa.

Melissa and John had been planning their wedding as I had come onto the scene, they invited to their wedding which was awesome of them. I knew Melissa for a few months (started in May) and she invited me to her wedding in August.

We both had a boss named JR. Much like other bosses at our company, JR came from a competitor and became a director quickly after joining and then eventually made his way up to senior director. The company had a habit of promoting people based on their work ethic (working all hours of the day/night/weekend) vs how they treated employees. JR wasn't by the far the worst offender but he had a habit of yelling at people if they screwed up.

What I didn't know is that JR and Melissa had a horrible relationship. Melissa would do things to subtly screw him over but he could never really do anything about it since there was no real proof. As the newbie, I started to figure out quickly that Melissa really really wanted to be a director.

After being under Melissa's wing for several months, JR decides that its time that I take on my own projects and moves me off of Melissa's projects onto my own. I'm thinking, great, this will be my time to shine! Melissa goes off on her honey moon and I start working with another Senior Analyst.

While on Melissa's honeymoon, JR calls us in to his office (there were 5 of us total, 4 excluding Melissa) and tells us he's been promoted to VP and is moving to the UK in a few weeks. He also announces that Jen, our current senior manager would move up into his position as a director, Peter would become the new senior manager and the rest of us would remain as is.

Being close friends with Melissa, I knew that she'd be pissed about the changes, especially since Melissa and Jen absolutely despised each other. Jen knew her shit and did things by the book so I had a lot of respect for her.

Another week goes by and Melissa finally comes back from vacation. Within an hour of her being at her desk, she pulls me outside for a chat. She rips into me about how I didn't tell her about the changes and what a bitch Jen is and that she should have gotten the promotion. I pointed out that Jen was already a manager and JR probably went down the totum pole. Melissa was having none of it... Little did I realize I had become an unwilling participant of her scheme to topple Jen, which hilariously backfired in her face.

**The Scheme:** As I mentioned above, Melissa decided that Jen had to be destroyed in order for Melissa to become the new Director. And to do that she decided to make Jen look incompetent...  In front of a client. As part of that scheme, she started making odd requests from me.

She asked me when Jen would come and go from the office and what questions she asked of me to do. Melissa also asked me if I could forward Jen's emails to her. Being wise to what Melissa was doing, I waited for Melissa to go on a smoke break (which she often did) and walked into Jen's office. I asked her why I had to start sending Melissa emails from Jen and if I should be taking orders from Melissa now. Jen looked pissed but said under no circumstances am I to send over any emails to Melissa.

I went back to work like nothing had happened and quietly started collecting all of the email requests from Melissa. I knew something was up and knew somehow I was being roped into something bad, very bad. 

As I mentioned before, I knew her husband John very well at this point and made a polite mention that Melissa was doing some weird stuff at work. He told me that she mentioned something weird to him but shrugged it off. I told him she had been acting really weird lately towards me and wasn't sure if I had done something wrong. He assured me that I hadn't pissed off his wife.

All is quiet in the office up until a week before Jen and Melissa are to go down to a client's office. They were supposed to present a proposal for a project, get the nod from the client and then start the project. Melissa was to be the lead with Jen as the acting director.

That's when the phone calls, weird texts and emails started hitting me. Melissa started reaching out to me asking for help on various slides, if I knew any drug dealers for either cocaine or Aderall, and if something happened by Friday, I would have her back. I told her it depends on what she was doing. She said, you'll see. 

I figured what the hell and helped her out with her slides. Come Friday morning, Melissa is in a panic. They have to get down to the client by 1pm and Melissa is still not done with her slides. She starts calling in favors to have people help her out. We pull together a bunch of stuff for her.  I am then asked to drive Melissa, Jen, and our data expert to the client meeting (not the first time this has happened); I oblige. On the way to the meeting, Melissa is still working on the slides.

I drop them off, head back to work, and think nothing of it.  By about 4 pm, all three of them walk into the office. Jen immediately storms into her office and slams the door. The data guy looks at me and just shakes his head. Melissa comes to my desk and asks me to step outside. I'm thinking to myself, ""Aww shit, what did you do?""

Turns out, Melissa decided to use the client meeting to sabotage Jen. She overtalked Jen and generally threw Jen under the bus for not having the slides completed (Melissa was supposed to be the one doing them). Jen being professional, kept quiet until the end of the meeting and afterwards on their taxi ride back, proceeded to scream at Melissa for the bullshit she just pulled.

Melissa has me outside and tells me the whole story and I stand there flabbergasted. She then pulls out a tape recorder and says, ""Oh and btw, I got the whole thing on tape.""  We live in a state where two party consent is required by law to be recorded. This is highly illegal and can land you in jail. I inform Melissa of this and she tells me that she doesn't care, she's got the company by the balls (for what, I have no idea).

**The Revenge:** I finally realize what all of the emails and check-ins were for, she's trying to get Jen fired for incompetence. I immediately save everything I have (emails and IMs) and put it in a file, knowing what's about to happen. I also notified her husband that she's about to be fired and to have a talk with her.

JR comes back into the office on Monday. Jen and JR are in the office and stuck in a room all day. This goes on for a few days before Melissa is called into the office. I remain quietly shaking and wondering what's about to happen. Melissa is still a good friend but holy shit I don't want to be screwed over.

The time comes and I'm called into JR's old office/Jen's new office. Both ask me what happened. I tell them my view of events. They asked if I knew about the tape recorder. I told them the truth that I hadn't known about it until after the fact. 

They asked for my laptop, login and password. Here it is, I'm fucked because of Melissa. She's decided to fold me into her scheme and we're both going to get canned. Knowing they were going to ask for that, I tell them to look into the evidence folder on my hard drive. They thank me, tell me that I shouldn't discuss this with anyone and to have a good weekend.

**The Aftermath:** Monday morning rolls around and I come into the office and am pleasantly surprised to see my laptop back at my desk with a note to see JR and Jen when I settle in. I walk into the office and they ask me to go for a nice long coffee break with the rest of the team.  I head out for a few ours with the team, we have some coffee and just bullshit a little and finally get back into the office a few hours later.

Melissa's desk is empty with no laptop, her stuff in a box. I get pulled into the office. They tell me that Melissa has been let go due to gross insubordination and that I am to no longer discuss the company with Melissa. 

From what I found out later from Melissa, she had decided to blackmail both Jen and JR with the tape of them lying to the client about services and how she was going to whistle blow on the company if they didn't give her a promotion and a raise. They asked for proof and when she played the tape, nothing had been recorded (I guess the recorder was shitty). They promptly asked her to leave and that they'd have a decision by Monday.

At this point, our friendship started to get rocky as Melissa started asking me for weird things and her marriage with John started going into the crapper.  Eventually we stopped talking as I realized how batshit crazy she is and how detrimental it is to be associated with her.  But the story doesn't quite end here.

**Karmic Backlash:** Remember how I said there was some serious karmic backlash?  Here's where Karma stepped in and screwed her life over even more.

She had found a new job after she got fired, but they had no idea she had been fired. They assumed she just left to come work for them. A year later, she was let go because of budget cuts (this was back when the market crashed in 2008; the real story is that they did a background check on her and called JR, he told them what happened). After that she did a series of contract work with various other research companies but never did land back on her feet.

During the course of her contract work, things between John and her went south fast. She alienated all of their friends by calling/emailing/texting people randomly at night, asking for various drugs and drug dealers. Her insanity spiraled out of control to the point where they started going to couple's therapy. Months before their marriage collapsed I get a random call from Melissa asking me to lie to their counselor, acting like her husband John, and telling the counselor that I had been beating her. I flat out refused and told her to never call me again.

John and I continued to be friends and we hung out at other people's places together. After the incident with the therapist, Melissa went on a mini-vacation to see her favorite band.  A week afterwards, Melissa is acting super awkward with John and so he grills her about it. She confesses and tells John that she had met a random guy online, met up with him at the concert and they hooked up. John was finally done with her shit and divorced her. He was awarded alimony for all of the debt she drove up on their cards. He soon moved out of the state with his new girlfriend. We still game via online, despite time differences.

Last I heard of her, she moved back home with her parents where she continues to be absolutely weird to this day.  I think she was doing some kind of secretary type of work.

**TL;DR:** Mentor tries to undermine her new boss, winds up getting canned. Karma jumps in and she becomes known as the weird lady in our industry, essentially being blacklisted from the industry. Husband divorces her after her crazy antics, dangerous behavior, and having an affair.",2017-05-02 16:24:13

So sometimes I head out to local giant hardware store with an employee or two to pick bulk items like sheetrock, cement bags, sand bags, tools, lights & fans, etc. I tend to go while wearing painter's slacks and shirts because I'd rather not dirty up my good clothes for this task. Sometimes I get other customers asking me where something is because for some reason they assume the guy that is wearing white which isn't the color of every employee's shirt in the place must also work there. I normally just say, *""I don't work here,""* and ignore them. In in this one instance that didn't work.

This dog, who's name will be Charlie, is a serious cardiac dog, who needs a ton of pills. And he won't take them in treats. He's also a little land shark.

This 4.7 pound dog doesn't discriminate if you get near his face, and will lash out with teeth at anyone stupid enough to get within bite range. Today I was training two new girls to work in the kennel.

Working in the kennel involves knowing how to hold animals properly; something in which this new girl is. Well. New at. 

After the doctor stands there watching me struggle to get the muzzle onto this dog, he chastises me for doing it by myself. I had been bitten two times (nothing serious thankfully.) and not once had he stepped in. And being in the moment I had forgotten to redirect the new girl. 

The doctor grabs the dog from me, and beckons to the new girl.

""Put your hand right here, over the top of the dog's head. Then you feel for the vertebra, and squeeze on either side. I call it the Vulcan Death Grip."" 

Charlie struggles for a little bit, completely losing his shit at one moment, flopping around.  He slowly curls up the same way a bug would after it dies, and immediately lies still. 

Now I panic because this dog has a heart condition. Meanwhile the doctor pokes the dog and shakes him.

""You're fine. You're ok.""

New girl in the corner, is looking at me, and then the doc. And then the dog. 

Finally the dog pops his head up and looks blearily at the doctor. Doctor shrugs his shoulders like nothing happened, and then continues to demonstrate how much control you have over the head. 

Later on I explained to the new girl, that had we caused that much stress to an animal, being kennel, we would have been disciplined. And rightfully so. She looks at me and asks,

""So don't use the Vulcan death grip?"" 




I cringed. ""Yeah. Don't.""

That evening, without the doctor present, I went over how to do it properly. ",2017-04-17 05:58:24

The meeting wasn't called off, we had enough that we could talk about without him being there.

The restroom is not attached to the room so he has to walk about 50 feet from his room into the bathroom. Once he leaves it's time to pat him down, and I do so in the day room where there is a better camera. 5 seconds into patting I feel something hard and heavy, so my instinct was to grab it and then the world comes crashing down to me. He had a massive erection that he was trying to hide due to the loose orange scrubs we provide them. I immediately break character and tell him ""I am so sorry just go to your room"". He didn't lash out or anything he was unphased, possibly embarrassed. I told my immediate supervisor and she just cried laughing to the floor. I then called the director to notify the situation. I'm really nervous now. The director said she'll take care of the situation As a guy myself I don't want to be seen as a molesting officer. They are minor for fucks sake uhhh. 

Some of you may wonder why I would pat someone down there but that is a popular hiding spot. I never expected him to be a state of arousal.

Then on Wednesday when I get back to work and I'm making my way around the office I got the real story from my co workers. My boss realized I was gone and jumped to the conclusion that I must be out looking for another job. She freaked out, and she started asking the guys that I work with if they knew what I was up to.

I posted this elsewhere, but since it's a failure by customer and management, I think it fits here too. This is a combined total failure of workers and customer working together to a storm cloud of wtf. A couple weeks ago I entered the costume contest during Time Traveler's weekend at the renn faire I usually work. I wasn't working then so I'm a fellow patron. As we're all waiting I overhear a woman asking about having fire fans on stage for her turn.
The organizer said ""Well, it's a costume contest not a performance, but I guess it's ok if short."" I almost went to have security radioed to alert them of such, but at the moment we got called to line up, so I missed the chance. We go up in turns, I do my thing & go to the back of the audience area to wait again.

Then the clusterf*ck happens. This woman comes on stage & I can only assume she's never actually used fire fans before. If I did the pics properly you can see the fluid flying. Her fans were way oversoaked in fluid. She flung fluid all over, she stayed way long for her turn, & she didn't put the fans out before finally leaving the stage.

She walked, with full on still flaming fans, down the middle aisle of a full crowd!!! The people running the contest failed here cause they didn't make her put out the fire before leaving the stage. They basically just moved on & completely ignored everything that happened afterwards like she ceased to be their problem the moment her feet left the stage area.

She then stood on the hay covered sidewalk area behind the audience between 2 booths not even trying to put out the fans! I immediately went over to the closest soda booths to radio security as this woman just posed for people with cameras like she was having a personal shoot.

Thankfully, security was coming around the corner at the same time so they came up behind her to stop this. The woman actually argued with them for a moment before being forced to put out her fans & escorted out of the faire. I advised my friend on security of how the contest organizers told her she could use fire & then let her walk off without any attempt to control the situation. I heard later how the contest people got deeply chewed out for allowing it in the first place without alerting the faire. They wouldn't have even necessarily said no, it just would have been better monitored & would have been shut down the second her soaked fans started spraying fluid everywhere. Considering how much dry leaves, hay, and etc is on site they're INCREDIBLY lucky she didn't start a fire or hurt anyone.

Last Friday I was working a night shift  at the animal hospital. My boss was in a pissy, foul mood. For the entirety of my work night he was snapping about little, dumb things. 

Just for one quick example, we had a dog we were trying to get an ultra sound on. She was a huge German shepard. I think I remember her clocking in at 108 pounds. 

She got the ultrasound cord wrapped around her leg and the sensor is connected to a laptop that takes the ultrasound. She pulls the cord. My boss says ""grab the laptop."" As I'm going to grab it he says it again more urgently, yelling. I had grabbed the laptop and everything was fine. No sweat.

""Its fine to be a spectator, but if I tell you to do something."" He shakes his head. 

Stupid shit like that. All day. And it shouldn't bother me because I should be above this, but moving on.

We are locking up. We have a sick cat that's on iv fluids. Just had surgery. Whole nine. I go through our checklist. Get shit done. The other girl stands by the microwave out of view of the cameras and dicks on her phone all night.

I've had it. I'm done. Kennel is done with their job and it's ten at night. I have to work the morning shift the next day. But we are waiting on my boss before we can lock up and leave. He's writing medical reports. Usually we just leave and he locks up. But tonight he wanted us to stick around. There's one other kennel nurse and a nurse technician. They both tell me I can leave. Check list done. I'm out.

I'm not saying I had no fault in this. But when I came to work the next day my boss was screaming.

That sick cat had an iv pump that wasn't plugged in. The battery died and the cat went without fluids for the night. I hadn't noticed before I left Friday night and I guess the other co workers AND my boss who left with them didn't notice.

So I got 10 minutes to get out of here now and go to work to get yelled at again. Because my manager wasn't there for all of this, and today is her first day back since the incident. So I'm waiting.

We have many small, thin blankets that are donated to us; and since most of our clients are from woodstock, their animals are just as ancient. Many of them have arthritis. 

After sitting with animals in these cages I started putting an extra blanket or two in, depending on the animal. Metal is hard and uncomfortable believe it or not.

My boss walks in, and points to the nearby cage.

""That's too many blankets. We are doing way too much laundry and we need to save on electricity and water."" 
He then hands me a bag of bloody towels from his cat and tells me to wash them. It takes up a whole load by itself.

Meanwhile he's bought a whole new blood analysis system that has to stay on overnight because it's hooked to some kind of special network.

So they get left on. All night.

Both of us airbrushed the shirts and pressed them, waiting for the family to pick up the shirts. Right after the last shirt was pressed, they came back and we gave them the shirts. Five minutes later, he comes back looking pissed.

Dad: (pissed) There's no UN-EEE-KORN on these shirts!
Me: Sir, you didn't specify the uni-

Me: The unicorn design is <amount> more. You said you wanted your daughters names on the shirts, nothing more.
Coworker: Darkside, if it will get them out of here, let's just add the unicorn.
Me: Might as well.

The weirdest company training of my professional career,51,61635g,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/61635g/the_weirdest_company_training_of_my_professional/,4,1490318212.0,"I've been working in computing for over 20 years, and I've had some interesting on-site training sessions during that time. But the training I just had in the past two days will definitely stay with me for a while. I was expecting two days of stupefying boredom, but instead I was hilariously entertained.

Some background: our company has recently started to roll out a new methodology for streamlining the software process. Let's call it the Zombo method. At first, management has tried to implement this on their own, but they've discovered that just reading the book and winging it doesn't really work, so now they've decided to cave and buy the training. It's a pretty invasive change, with teams being reorganized, a new way of planning, working, releasing and so on. The R&D department, which I'm a part of, is understandably skeptical.

To roll out Zombo, management has been given a training, and now the rest of us are in for this treat too, spread out over two days. Seems reasonable. I've decided to consider it a fairly pointless two-day vacation from work; let's see what happens.

The first strange thing is that the trainer doesn't introduce himself at the beginning of the course. It might be because some of us were waiting for him in the wrong conference room at first due to some mixup, but still, several dozen people enter the right conference room a few minutes late, and the guy doesn't tell his name. I still have no idea what he's called, so I guess we're going to have to refer to him as The Trainer.

Sitting down at a table, I find myself seated beside a colleague, let's call him Mark, who's in a foul mood. He explains the following to me:

* His team is currently in a state of limbo, and it's unclear what they are going to be doing.
* The person who should have told them what to do, their manager, was hired a few months back and has done nothing at all to help them.
* Instead, this manager has spent all her time pitching Zombo to the company, and almost immediately after doing so, has quit.

Mark will spend the entire two days griping about everything and anything The Trainer (who is not connected to that manager in any way as far as I know) has to say, dismissing him as a marketing guy trying to hawk Zombo to us. This is obviously puzzling to The Trainer, who patiently tries to extol the virtues of Zombo (sometimes sounding like he's making a sales pitch, yes, but mostly explaining fairly dry technical details).

But the pushback doesn't come from Mark alone. Many other colleagues are also getting into discussions with the trainer, slowing down the training. This is for several reasons:

* It's becoming clear during the training that management has misunderstood important parts of Zombo, and is misimplementing it. For example, they told us that being reorganized into new teams might be a bitch, but that the problems would resolve themselves and things would stabilize in about three months. The Trainer clearly disagrees with that estimate. The Trainer also keeps having to say that he gave the managers a pretty hard time, but nobody seriously believes that management is going to make a radical change themselves. 
* The Trainer is seeing problems that don't really exist. For example, much time is spent on emphasizing that geographically distributed teams are terrible, even though the entire R&D team is used to working that way. We stopped having issues with videoconferencing years ago, people ping each other using instant messaging all the time, etc.

All of our criticism is obviously getting to the guy, but he's acting professionally, deflecting questions with vague generalities and playing question-and-answer games that somehow always turn out to demonstrate the benefits of Zombo. My colleagues aren't buying it, and the mood is gloomy.

After a lunch break, we do some exercise, with different employees presenting their results. This is where I first start noticing that The Trainer is sitting on his chair, clearly nodding off. This will happen multiple times during the two days. He doesn't outright fall asleep, but he's got his eyes closed and is obviously about to doze off. (A colleague, who was generally not so adverse to the training, said that he noticed it too and confronted The Trainer with it, who told him that it was because of his ""condition"" --whatever that means.)

The first real drama happens in the afternoon of Day 1. The group is supposed to do some group exercise designed to demonstrate the value of teamwork; I won't bore you with the details, but let's say it's a fairly childish exercise for a bunch of grown men to do. 

Maybe that's why one of my colleagues, let's call him Ivan, a Russian guy, suddenly decides that he doesn't want to participate; he says he'll ""observe"" instead. The Trainer isn't having it, insisting that participation is the whole point of an exercise designed to point out the value of teamwork. Or to put it another way, he doesn't like that Ivan is not playing along with proving the point he's trying to make, and is undermining his authority. They have a tense standoff for several minutes, with neither of them backing down, while the rest of the group is deadly silent. The Trainer wants to send Ivan out of the room, but Ivan won't do that either. Eventually, they talk one-on-one in a corner, as the rest of the group takes an awkward coffee break, and after a few minutes, Ivan turns out to have been somehow convinced to stay and participate.

No less awkward is when The Trainer tries to illustrate the beauty of a highly efficient team by showing us a YouTube video of the haka dance as performed by the All Blacks, the New Zealand rugby team. I'm sure you've seen it: the team does a traditional dance involving menacing gestures, chanting, and sticking out of tongues. It's a lot of fun to watch, but The Trainer gets weirdly emotional: he's on the verge of tears, apparently deeply moved by the amazing teamwork. Maybe someone should have told him that a sports team doesn't make for a great metaphor to a room full of software developers. Again, an awkward silence hangs in the room.

Apart from this, the training is riddled with mishaps: the projector isn't working right, The Trainer projects onto a wall filled with Post-its and presentations so that nothing is readable, etc. There are also many cases of the trainer starting to clap at some group member's show-and-tell, with only a few people joining in to create a very unenthusiastic smattering of applause.

By the time Day 2 rolls around, the trainer is making little effort trying to hide his ""OK, let's just get through this shit"" attitude, and most of the group seems to agree with him at least on this point. At this stage, he's conceded to our criticisms enough that he's willing to say, over and over, that this transition is not going to be easy, that it'll be painful in the beginning etc. Which of course makes the group even more unwilling to play along.

Also, he's a bulky guy, and I can't help noticing his beer belly showing below his T-shirt, as well as a reminder of [a certain Magic: The Gathering tournament](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/202wd3/i_participated_in_one_of_the_biggest_magic_the/). 

We spend almost the entire second day covering a basic methodology we already use, so most of the group are bored out of their minds relearning what they've already been doing for several years, with the added joy of being told by an outsider that they've been doing it wrong all this time.

As the day is nearing its end, the trainer wants us to do a little exercise: take the evaluation technique we've just learned and apply it to the training itself: what went well, what didn't go so well, what might he improve? Again, awkwardness reigns supreme as the group considers how honest they want to be. Not unsurprisingly, it's Mark who speaks up first, calling the training ""boring"" and noting as a positive point that he got a free lunch out of it. The trainer gulps audibly and dutifully takes down the barrage of criticism that follows as other group members join the fray. 

And so we slowly limp toward the end of the 2nd day. The finish line is in sight and we can all go home. But wait, what's this? At 5:15 PM, friend Ivan decides that The Trainer is not getting off so easy. He says that the course is pointless, that the vague claims about its purported success rate are not substantiated, and that The Trainer's claim that this has worked for hundreds of other companies doesn't count for anything. 

At this point, The Trainer decides to throw a hissy fit and announces that if this is how it's going to be, he's going to quit. (Remember, there's maybe half an hour left on the clock.) He dramatically hands his next-PowerPoint-slide-clicker to Ivan (""if you know it all, why don't *you* do the training!"") and unplugs his computer, clearly threatening to storm off in a huff.

I'm honestly not sure if at this point, he expected someone to go, ""No, wait, stay! Ivan doesn't speak for all of us!"" As it is, nobody tries to stop him, he calms down, returns to face the group, and to make the humiliation complete, has none other than Mark intervene on his behalf, defuse the tension somewhat, and have a reasonably open conversation about what's bothering the group. The training still goes on for another hour or so. In the end, rather than thanking us, or us thanking him, he simply says, ""You can go if you like as far as I'm concerned,"" which the group gratefully accepts as a sign that the training is over.

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the trainer maxed out his per diem at the hotel bar that night on hard liquor. But if I'm going to be asked to score the training, I fully intend to check all the ""Very Satisfied"" boxes. I haven't enjoyed a training this much in years.",2017-03-24 03:16:52

I took my morning deuce around 9:00AM. As I was sitting there a thought came to mind, ""What if I took away ALL the toilet paper? And the person after me had to drop a deuce so bad that he didn't even check to see if there was any available?""


I wrestled with this for a moment. I'm usually a low-key guy who doesn't like seeing people get messed with. Stand-up. Mature.


Well, the office was stale for a while (not a lot of exciting news). So I decided to play a little TP prank. However, instead of taking ALL the toilet paper away, I decided to leave a ""lifeline"" for the victim. I took away all the spare rolls but left the roll that was already in the holder. This way, the victim is comforted by the fact that there is TP available. BUT, here's the twist: I loosened the toilet paper holder from the wall/divider so if the victim tried unraveling the TP, it would fall, throwing the victim into a nervous frenzy.


The bathroom is down the hall from my office. I anxiously answered emails while wondering if my prank was a success. A client gave me a ring and I was indulged into a conversation with him about our Q1 strategy until I heard ""Ahhhh ouhhhh f***!!!!!!"" coming from the bathroom.


Immediately, I knew someone fell victim to the prank. As I was hanging up the phone, I saw a stampede of co-workers rushing to the front to check what the commotion was. There were about 5 co-workers standing outside the Mens room. Bryan (IT Manager) opened the door, only to see the roll toilet paper sprawled out all over the bathroom floor, while the VP of our firm was yelling profanities.


Bryan: You alright?

VP: Aww f***! Get me TP!

Bryan: What happened?

VP: The holder broke and the TP fell, hit my foot, and rolled out under the stall!

Bryan: Ok here.. (while picking up the roll and handing it to him under the stall door).

VP: If I find out who loosened the holder he'll be fired! 


Unfortunately, the embarrassment didn't end there. Not only did 1/2 the office know of this charade, but about 3 customers who were standing in the lobby heard the shrieks coming from the bathroom as well. 


The VP was so mad that he began an investigation to see who played the prank. Yes, an investigation. He had the secretary gather bathroom times. Everyone who used the mens room during 8AM-11AM had to be interrogated. My name was on the list. However, the VP has his eyes set on another co-worker.


We'll see.",2017-03-20 15:01:21
A Very Special Delivery,90,60bfdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/60bfdi/a_very_special_delivery/,3,1489946841.0,"Hey all, I've got another story for you from a few years ago.

I used to work in a big-box store. My management team at this job was really in to this idea of ""do above and beyond what they need all the time"", just often times didn't put it into practice.

One day, during patio season (Mid June-July) I was working in garden, and a nice older couple came in. Like many people they'd come do their shopping, and have a seat in the nice comfy patio chairs. Unfortunately, my management felt this was impeding on OTHERS buying the product, and came up to talk to me.

Manager: Pierogi! Pieorgi, those two there. Get them out of those chairs! If they want to sit in 'em, they can take 'em home. We got quotas to meet!

Me: Alright, I'll go talk to them. They just might've gotten a little tired from shopping.

Manager: That's fine, but we have benches for that.

Now, at the time I lived in a small town of about 8,000 people. Most folks either went to church with you, their kids went to school with you, or both. These folks were new to me.

Me: Hello there! Can I help ya'll today?

Man: Oh! Just what we needed! We were just enjoying this great couch! We were talking about getting us one, but we don't have a way to get it to our house.

Me: Well, we don't normally do deliveries, but let me see what I can do.

Man: Y'see Franny? Thats great customer service!!

I walked away happily, looking for my manager to ask him about delivery, only to find him looking for me!

Manager: Where have you been?! There's people waiting in garden!!

Me: Those folks wanna buy that couch.

Manager: Then let them! They don't need you to do that!

Me: Actually, they wanted us to deliver it.

Manager: We don't do that!

Me: ...I could deliver it, I have a bigger car and...

Manager: No, then you'd need to leave.

Me: They're willing to wait.

Manager: Fine, you wanna do it, Fine! Do it after your shift, but you're not getting overtime!

Me: That's fine by me.

And so I did. I got the couple's phone number and address, plugged it into my GPS, and went for it. Then I ran into a major problem:

The set was 5 assembled chairs, and a couch. At the time, I drove a Chevy Equinox, and while i could definitely fit 5 chairs, I couldn't fit the couch in one trip.

Determined, I decided to do what I had learned from being a southerner my whole life:

Rope and Duct tape fix all things.

I got all of the chairs into my vehicle, (albeit by rolling down all the windows and having the legs stick out like evil pyres of death from within..) and had one of my co-workers fetch a ladder for me. (Without my manager seeing, that is.)

I grabbed the couch, hoisting it on to the top of my car, while another of my co-workers tied it to the rear hitch of my car. (I knew that thing'd come in handy one day.) After some finangling, I got it attached, but I had one remaining problem...

My trunk, which was already ajar from the chairs inside the car, was flapping in the breeze, so to speak, like a wiggle man at a used car lot.

So, using my training as a then 20-year-old garden associate armed with only the wit of my forefathers and a roll of duct tape, I taped that son of a bitch down like I was Dexter and Jed Clampett'd it to the customer's home.

I called the customer, who met me outside, grinning from ear to ear at the sight of my amalgamation of car and chair.

Man: Now that's customer service! What do I owe you?

Now, one thing you should know about me is that I have an extremely hard time taking money from people for the things that I do. I like to be helpful, and get great joy from doing so...HOWEVER, in this particular case, I was dehydrated, most likely bleeding, and had whacked myself in the head to near concussion. I could've at least asked him for a cold drink, right?

Me: Not a thing, It's my pleasure. Thank you for shopping at ***.

I turned around to my car, when I was stopped by the man's wife, who grabbed my hand and shook it, sticking a piece of paper into it.

Me: Thank you. (opens hand) Ma'am, this is a $100 bill. I-

Woman: No, that's right. We heard your manager talking to you. You're worth a lot more than that hundred dollar bill, too. Remember that.

She reached up and patted my cheek, as only knowing, grandmotherly ladies can.

I took her words to heart. About a month later, I was ""released"" for ""lack of customer response surveys"" or something like that. The manager had me escorted out because ""its just policy."" Thankfully, the security guard was a friend of mine, and let me walk out on my own, giving me a brotherly hug and handshake as I left.

I later got a job just down the road from that job, at a truck stop, and the lady and her husband came in one day, and were excited to see me. They even bragged about me to my new manager.

God bless those two.",2017-03-19 20:07:21

He remembered the CEO as the loving husband of ""a reasonably young wife."" 
 
He said that the CEO was a man of deep personal faith, and was surely at rest in the arms of the Lord, and that he had also had an abiding faith in our company: specifically, faith that our stock should command a much higher earnings multiple than it does.

Monthly free lunch drama.,94,5wxvqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5wxvqv/monthly_free_lunch_drama/,33,1488394266.0,"Our company gives us monthly free lunches. Usually 3 days a month during the month end reporting everyone gets ordered lunch on company dime as a way of saying thanks. 

Well that free thanks turned into one of our HR people resigning today. 

Usually the free lunches go like this. Day 1 this epic chicken place that has open flame rotisserie chicken. Day 2 pizza (because of course its pizza), Day 3 usually a sub or sandwich from anywhere except subway. 

Its the day 3 sandwich which brought down an HR dinosaur. 

Two months ago this was the email. 

*There are a large number of unclaimed free lunches. Please go ahead and take these home if you wish. The free lunches are a thank you from the company and may disappear if they are not taken advantage of. Thank you.* 

Welp... the free lunches that were not claimed were chicken salad sandwiches. 

Last month same email followed by emails from our section heads to each individual person who badged out to go somewhere else. 

He sent me an email basically stating the same thing and asking why I did not partake. My response was...

*I chose not to partake in the free lunch today because, unfortunately, by the time I got down there to grab mine all that was left was chicken salad sandwiches.* 

*I do not like chicken salad. I do not mean to offend anyone and that is why I badge out through the side exit and slip off to whataburger or something else.*

*If this is an issue I will stop. I just chose not to eat chicken salad and to be honest if I did grab a box it would not be ate by me.*

His response was a laugh and saying he would pass on the message. Apparently a LOT of people had the same concerns as yesterday afternoon we got this email. 

*Due to the selfishness of several individuals, we will not be ordering chicken salad again. I apologize to everyone who likes it but unfortunately we have some selfish people in the office who can only think for themselves. Tomorrow the flavors are, turkey and bacon, roast beef and cheddar, and tuna.*

Followed by a flood of emails to section heads basically saying WTF. 

This morning SOME people who had outlook open got this email. 

*Seeing as no one can be happy with sensible choices in sandwich styles we will not have lunch anymore. I would like to point out that not only are Tuna sandwiches and Chicken Salad sandwiches tasty. They are also healthy for you. IF you can not be selfless enough to simply eat a damn tuna sandwich then you do not deserve one. Thank you and have a bad day.*

The email was scrubbed from the server, but those who left their outlook open already received it. This morning a new email was sent out. 

*We wish ____ luck in her future endeavors and understand her reasons for leaving _____ company. Today we will simply double up on pizza and next month we will utilize a spreadsheet so we can order a personalized selection for sandwich days. Thank you.*

So TL:DR Lady who orders lunch for the office as a thank you got pissy when no one liked chicken salad. Then got even more pissy when no one liked tuna. Sent an unprofessional email out and was asked to resign. Got pizza instead. ",2017-03-01 20:51:06
Add Chili to the Chili Recipe!,15,5welhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5welhh/add_chili_to_the_chili_recipe/,9,1488168226.0,"I rewrite recipes as a way to make meets end, which is usually a fairly straightforward job. Client comes with a recipe and an expected number of words, I rewrite it so that it isn't obvious it's copied from somewhere else, etc. 


It's pretty easy, just time consuming. 


Anyway, most clients come with pretty straightforward requests, but there's this client who gave me a very good chili recipe to rewrite.

Wrote it, sent it, discarded it from my mind until a couple of days later, when the client sends me an email asking me to include a pre-made chili brand in the recipe. 

I add it as a comment, letting people know that the brand is very good and 100% natural and send it back. 

Client writes me a few days later letting me know I *have* to make the pre-made chili part of the recipe. 

I've tried explaining that if the branded chili is already made, there's no real point in adding it to the chili recipe. Since the chili recipe makes chili from scratch. 

No luck. The branded chili needs to go in this chili. 

I'm sincerely concerned about the poor soul that actually tries this thing. ",2017-02-27 06:03:46
Turn your water on? I'll make sure you cant do that again.,129,5wdeqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5wdeqi/turn_your_water_on_ill_make_sure_you_cant_do_that/,20,1488153979.0,"Buckle up, this is a long one.

So I work as a water operator for a small municipality, I have 1500 water taps to homes and businesses and roughly 5000 people that get water from my system. I've done my job for 3 years and if you ask any water operator, they will have a story just like this or worse.

So it all starts with our customer, (let's call him DL). It was winter 2015, and DL's service line going to his house goes under a state road. Frost goes much deeper on uncovered areas, especially roads. DL's line freezes. So DL calls us and we come to thaw the line (this was probably our 5th customer of the year to have this happen).  We tell him to run water and we take his metering device off so he can run It and not worry about overage. Cut to 3 days later....

3 days later DL calls me and says his water froze again, I asked if he was running water (already knowing the answer).  He says he has. Last I checked running water will never ever freeze unless it's ungodly cold but DL claims it has.  Okay.  We thaw it again and this time it sticks.  So we talk to DL and decide to put a new tap and pit in for him on a street above him ($1500) for free. All he has to do is put a new service in (120ft) and he will never worry about freezing AND have loads of pressure he didn't have on his ancient line. He says sure he will get right on it.

We put the new stuff in for DL  in May and watch his place til mid August and we see he has not put his new line in. So I give our solicitor a call to see if we can get things rolling. Solicitor writes up an unofficial notice saying DL has until the end of September to put his line in. I guess DL didn't like this because he comes to a monthly meeting our company has (open to the public) to dispute his line being shut off. His reasoning is that he pays for his water, it can't be shut off. Well it can be when you agree to put new stuff in and also get a 1500 tap for free.  DL's case wasn't helped when he came to the meeting drunk as a skunk and carrying a gun on his hip. He was shut down and kicked out and it felt great.

So our board gives DL until Oct. 31 to get his line in.  He gets an official  notice by registered mail (you have to sign for it or else it comes back to us) saying he has until November 1st to put his line in or the water will be shut off. The big day comes and no new line is put in. So I shut DL's water off like I would anyone who didn't pay their bill. DL stops by our office screaming about his water being off. When asked if he read the notice he says he never got it. Our secretaries tell him they can't do anything and DL leaves.  Looking at the security cameras we have, you can clearly see our notice sticking out of his pocket. (Keep in mind he has to sign for this notice to be delivered and we never got it back).

 A few days go by and I get a feeling he turned his water back on.  Sure enough, we check and DL has turned himself on.  

I upgrade and use a lockout tool, basically it's 2 plastic plates with rubber in the middle. When it is screwed down the rubber expands and seals the curb box you turn the water on from.  I put this in the pipe after shutting the water off.  The next day I stop by and see DL broke our lockout tool, and turned himself back on and put the tool in there as if I wouldn't notice. So I go from a 1 in my fighting scale to a 100. I get my crew to come together, and we stake out his house.

 Once DL leaves for work we strike.  We dig up his line across the state road and unhook it from the main.  But, me being the vindictive prick I am, that's not the end. I hook a chain to the backhoe we are using and pull his 25 ft copper line out from under the road and leave It in his driveway. I go to our district court house and also have him fined almost 300$ for turning himself on illegally and rendering a 'theft of service' against him. 

Good luck turning your water on now asshole.

1 week later DL  has his line in and to this day will not look at me because he knows he was in the wrong and it never had to escalate to that.


TLDR:  customers water froze, gave him a free $1500 water tap and a whole summer to do it. He doesn't and when we shut his water off he turns it on again. I escalate the issue and rip his line out of the ground so he can't turn himself on.  I win.",2017-02-27 02:06:19

**Background**

I am/was a nerdy code geek. Most content to sit in my corner, typing furiously at my keyboard and ignoring People. 

Through some underhanded political shenanigans (and outright blackmail) my current boss, who was amazing, was forced to give me over to $Boss to work tech support. 

Because I kicked and screamed all the way, company policy dictated that I *must* accept the transfer, but would be rewarded with a hefty raise in pay. No one in the company saw any problem at all with a code geek doing tech support. Same thing, right?

Now I'm working in a position I am not trained for, but I'm making much more money than my co-workers. My direct supervisor ($DS), whom I liked, reported to $Boss. 

When the time came to hire a new tech, $DS managed it as a team enterprise, as we would all have to work with the new hire. $DS settled on $CTG. I vehemently protested this (important later). There were red flags in his resume (which $CGT later confessed he paid Big Bucks to have professionally done), and he had an slimy  personality. 

Shortly after hiring $CTG, $DS moved on to another company. I was offered the responsibilities of $DS without the title, of course, but with another small bump in pay. Since I knew that the company had no intention of filling this vacant position, therefore I would become the de facto lead anyway (as the highest earner), I agreed. 

That's how I became supervisor in a field where I had little training, and no desire to work long term. Important to note, too, that I wasn't a People person. I liked Silly Users well enough, as they didn't know any better. I was not tolerant of people on my team who didn't pull their weight. As in, I was apt to rain hellfire down on those who did Stupid Things. 

**The Last Straw**

By this time, things are not good between $Me and $CTG. 

Every time I take a complaint about $CTG to $Boss, the conversation goes something like this:

>$Me: $CTG has screwed up...

>$Boss: You need to train him. After all, you were part of the team that hired him, so there must be something there you liked. 

>$Me: (frustrated) I've tried. It's not working. 

>$Boss: Well, document everything. Each time you train him. Each time he makes a mistake. We need a paper trail before we can consider changing his job. 

I am now documenting everything. I am talking to HR about things I can do to give him some additional training. I am giving him formal written reprimands for his screwups. Which he does not like at all, and often ends with him screaming at me. 

$CTG is definitely feeling the pressure. It's so bad that every time $CTG gets close to the firing line, he files a Workers Comp claim. This takes the pressure off. Legal and HR won't fire someone as long as the claim is open. I won't list the types of claims $CTG filed because they are so utterly ridiculous that no one else in the history of the world could have possibly filed similar claims. 

When $CTG's last claim is finally resolved, he immediately opens a complaint of Sexual Harassment and Hostile Workforce Environment, targeted at...guess who? Yep. $Me. 

I am not supposed to know about this, but you know how workplaces are. It didn't take me long to find out. I'm beginning to worry about my future employment...and the stain this might leave on my resume. 

I am told that (1) I cannot raise my voice to $CTG and (2) I cannot, under any circumstances, talk to HR about $CTG any longer. Any concerns I have, I must report directly to $Boss. 

One day, $CTG does something so outrageous that I lose my shit. I raise my voice. About 3 words in...I caught myself and shut my mouth. Then I just turned on my heel and walked into $Boss' office. I report what I did. 

Then I go get a lawyer. I'm sweating bullets. The *only* saving grace in this is that no one else saw this incident. So it's my word against his, but I'm not gonna lie. I raised my voice. My lawyer says this is not a big deal. He explains my rights to me. Tells me to be cool and let it all blow over. 

$Boss finds out I'm talking to a lawyer about this BS. $Boss reports this to HR. HR and Legal lose their cool because I'm not supposed to know about this investigation. 

I am summoned to HR, where I am ambushed by Legal and spend a grueling 2 hours under questioning. Honestly, guys, if I hadn't talked to a lawyer beforehand and therefore, knew exactly what I was required/not required to answer, I think I would have been toast. Burnt toast. 

**The Outcome**

A week or two later, I am called into Legal again. They want to talk about my recent interactions with $CTG. I think they want to talk about the day I raised my voice, but that's not it. They are trying to get me to talk about $CTG and something that supposedly happened, but I don't have a clue. 

They ask me to recount all the recent personal conversations I've had with $CTG. This isn't hard because there aren't many. I'm trying not to say anything to $CTG that isn't strictly work-related. I'm trying not to be alone with him, either. 

The only thing that sticks out in my mind is this creepy, kinda veiled threat I got from him. One random day, he walks up to my desk. 

>$CTG: That's a nice house you live in. 

>$Me: What??

>$CTG: Yeah, you're living over in co-worker's neighborhood. 

>$ME: What??

>$CTG: I helped him move last weekend. You know he's living right down the street from you?

>$Me: What makes you think that's my house?

>$CTG: Because your car was parked in the driveway. You know, that (goes on to describe my vehicle in great detail). 

Then after that conversation and before I was summoned to Legal, someone egged my car. While it was sitting in my driveway. I live in a fairly nice neighborhood, but things like this happen now and again. Usually though, it's random kids driving through on a Saturday night and throwing eggs from moving cars. This time, no one else got hit and mine wasn't in the street. It was in my driveway. So, I'm a little freaked out...

After I recount the creepy conversation to Legal, I reluctantly mention the egging. But I say, there's no proof of anything and I'm not accusing anyone of anything. 

I don't want to give them *anything* to say I'm lying or being vindictive or biased. I'm thinking this will backfire on me. 

Much to my surprise, Legal gets visibly upset. Abruptly terminates the meeting. 

A couple of days later, I get called into $Boss' office. It's about 3 in the afternoon. 

>$Boss: At 4pm, two armed LEOs will be here to escort $CTG out of the office. As soon as they arrive, I want you to lock him out of the network.

>$Me: Wha....?

>$Boss: Don't say anything to him. Don't even look at him. Don't say a word to anyone else. 

>$Me: Okay. 

>$Boss: Go to you office. No matter what happens, don't leave your desk. We are hoping this goes smoothly, but we don't know what he will do. 

I go sit in my office. At 4pm two policemen walk down the hall. They collect $CTG and escort him out. I never saw him again.

The One Where I Get a Driver Fired,123,5v6498,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5v6498/the_one_where_i_get_a_driver_fired/,5,1487614228.0,"Long time lurker, forgive my formatting, blahblahblah.  


At the time of this story, I worked as a warehouse supervisor for an office supply chain in Canada.  I was given pretty broad range to run the warehouse as I saw fit.  During my interview, the GM asked me three questions, one of which was, ""If a driver is giving you problems, do you have an issue telling them to eff-off?""  So, that should give you an indication as to what I was allowed to do.  Also relevant to the story is that my co-worker in this warehouse was a 5-foot-nothing, 100 pound soaking wet girl.  She was the definition of a firecracker when you pissed her off, but otherwise super sweet (her and I become very close friends and I'm highly protective of her in the same way someone might be of their little sister.)


Now, since my co-worker was an attractive girl in an industry dominated mostly by sweaty, hairy, gross truck drivers, she would usually get some unwanted attention by these guys.  She usually managed to take it in stride.  That said, within a couple years, we managed to get about half a dozen drivers either taken off our route or even fired (one guy had even managed to track her down off hours to the townhouse complex she rented at, though thankfully never managed to figure out which particular unit, just as an example.)  However, one story still sticks out with me.


A particular courier company we dealt with would deliver their freight shipments on a separate truck.  This driver was the absolute definition of Redneck trucker.  Pot belly, half bald, always sweaty and smelly, bragged about taking his mom to a mud wrestling competition for Mother's Day one year (and no, I never asked if his mom was the one wrestling or not... didn't want to know).  Y'know, that sort.  He always made passes to my co-worker but every time she made it clear to him that she wasn't interested in the least.  Anyway, one day I get a call from my brother.  He also worked in a warehouse for a well known automotive performance company about twenty minutes down the road from my store.  M=me, B=bro

>B: ""So I just had a very... interesting conversation with a driver about [your co-worker.]  I'll give you three guesses who I'm talking about.""


>M: ""(gives first name that pops to mind)""


>B: ""That's him.  He was just talking about what he would love to do with her[bro goes into specifics that I'll keep out of here, though I'm sure your imagination is probably correct], but said she must be a lesbo.  She keeps rejecting him and instead insists on hanging out with some [homophobic slur] she works with.  I kept my mouth shut but wanted to give you the heads up to do as you see fit.  He said he's on the way to drop off a shipment to [my company] and wanted some time to look at her so he'll have something to keep him warm tonight.""


Conversation goes on for a couple more minutes before I thank him and hang up.  At this point I'm seething - I'm seeing red.  I'm a very easy going guy and am almost impossible to bring to anger, but this had me going.  By now my co-worker comes back into the warehouse after helping a customer and sees me blowing smoke out of my ears.  As I go to answer her, I see the expected courier truck backing into my loading dock.  I tell her to go for a break, that I have this truck and don't worry about it just yet.  She leaves, confused.  I also give my manager a quick call, saying something along the lines of ""I might get fired for what I'm about to do, but trust me - it's completely justified.""  She's also confused but says she trust me and to keep her updated.


Anyway, buzzer rings, I open the man door and let the driver in.  He's obviously looking around the loading area for my co-worker while trying to hand me the waybill slips.  I've manage to cool my head slightly and decided to try something with the guy.  D= driver.


>M: ""She's not here right now, she's on break.""


>D: ""Oh, that's too bad.""  (Again, he tries to hand me the paperwork and is looking at the still locked rolling door)


>M: ""So I just had an interesting conversation with someone a few minutes ago.""


>D: ""Oh yeah?""


>M: ""Yeah.  Someone from [Well Known Automotive Performance Company] called me, said something about a chat they had with you."" 


(that got his attention)


>M: ""That guy you were talking to about [co-worker] and saying sh*t about me?  Guess what, that's my little brother...""


(By now, the driver went white and, grossly enough, even more sweaty)


>D: ""[incoherent stammering]""


>M: ""I don't want to hear it.  Get the [f-bomb] out of my warehouse, don't ever say that sh*t about [co-worker] or myself again and don't ever come back either here or to [bro's company.]  


>D: ""[more incoherent stammering and protestations.]""


>M: ""Get. The. [f-bomb]. Out.  Now.""


(Now, I've got many years of martial arts training under my belt, and my Sensei was also an ex-ERT RCMP officer (Canadian version of SWAT), so I had some pretty thorough training.)  


I realized as soon as I uttered that last sentence I had reflexively dropped into a defensive stance.  I'm not a threatening looking guy by any stretch of the imagination but this driver took one look, opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, and all but fled out the door.


My co-worker and manager, having heard the commotion, both came bolting into the warehouse.  I filled them into what had happened, all the while hearing the background noise of this guy's truck doing it's very best to peel out of the loading bay.  Manager tells me she'll back me up no matter what and the co-worker seems a little shell shocked (again, I'm not one to get angry so she had never experienced or heard it before.)  Manager offers to cover the warehouse for a little bit so I can go out for a smoke to calm down.  During that break I give that company a call.  Talk to dispatch first, who patches me over to some supervisor.  He then passes me up to Ops Manager, where I explain the whole situation and give him my brother's work number to verify his part.


Never saw that guy on my route again.  Turns out he was the Shop Steward and lost that role.  He also lost a coveted position on the 2010 Olympics sponsorship his company had originally offered him a few days previously.  Then a few days later, after a full investigation had occurred, our regular courier driver (not freight driver) for the same company informed us he had been fired for harassment, unprofessional conduct, and many other things.  Turns out that investigation opened up some unreported issues he had with other companies he dealt with.  I didn't care, though.  He was gone.  No one talks about my [not actually] little sister like that.


And that's how I gleefully got a driver fired.


tl:dr - Courier driver unknowingly talks to my brother about sexually harassing my co-worker.  I get angry, driver gets fired.

Sometimes I'll look up as he walks by and he'll quickly turn his head - not at all subtle. Most of the time I just ignore him and keep working but sometimes it really bugs me, mostly because I don't know why he'd do that. 

In case anyone wonders I really don't think it's rooted in anything inappropriate or sketchy. Just a bit frustrating, I don't think anyone enjoys feeling like they're being monitored.

This happened during my second week at my job, but was easily the most memorable moment I've had at this job. 

One morning during the summer, I'm sitting at the front desk and this woman walks in. She's fired up for some reason and she has her student worker right next to her, and to be honest her student worker is looking sort of embarrassed. 
A= Angry Lady  M= Me

A:""Why does my student worker not have access to Fortis yet?!""
(Fortis is a database where my school tracks all of its forms, its a big deal with the administrative types.)

M:"" I'm sorry ma'am, usually that takes one to two business days, and I can see here that you just brought in her access form yesterday.""

A:""But she needs her access so that she can work!""

M: ""I know ma'am, but I am not the one who proce--""

She cuts me off

A:""I demand to speak to your manager, you have not been helpful at all and I need my student worker to start working today and absolutely no later!!""

I concede and go get my manager. My manager comes out swinging.

Manager:""I understand you want your student worker to have access today?""

A:""Yes""

Manager:""Well we cannot give her access because our Fortis admin. is on vacation today. He'll be back tomorrow and we can sort this out then.""

A literally looks like she could kill a man in that moment. Visibly trying to hold in her anger, her student worker says:

SW: ""Maybe it's okay, I could do something else?""
A:""No.""

She looks back at my boss and says
A:""So you don't know when he'll be back.""

Manager: ""He has been a reliable employee for many years, he assured me he'd be back tomorrow.""

A:""YOU DON'T KNOW THAT! ONLY GOD KNOWS THAT!

She slams my desk with her fist, grabs her had afterwards as if she were in pain, and then walks out the door saying that she hates IT. 
Her student worker just says ""I am so sorry for that"" and walks out after her. 

The next day, A brought BBQ for me and my manager because of the whole incident. 

Never saw her come in again. ",2017-02-13 23:29:39

His department manager is fond of reminding his employees that he has an MBA and they don't. He uses this excuse whenever anyone questions his actions. Wonderful things like buying a generator, used and without warranty from a private seller, and then finding out the motor had been painted to cover cracks and leaks, and it was missing all electrical cords. Another time, he bought a replacement for a piece of out-dated equipment, bought from certified suppliers, but ignored workers who told him it wouldn't fit in the door. (Later it was returned because it was cheaper to pay the penalty than it was to tear a hole in the wall for a bigger door.) 

The latest one is a memo issued to employees, after one of his workers went to corporate HR and ask if they were going to be recognized for a safety milestone. Suddenly, he jumps into action!

> Team, We achieved 2 yrs Incident Free on Jan4/2017. This is a great milestone for everyone in the department. We are working on plans for a celebration. See your supervisor to put in your idea on how to celebrate...of course there are some guidelines:

> Cannot involve the purchase of gift Cards as these purchases are not sanctioned by our accounting department

>Value of the good needs to be max $120 and cannot be cash, ie must be a purchased good like a Jacket or cooler etc.

>Keep in mind a good and a celebration ie Purchase of a new winter jacket(4 styles to choose from) and a breakfast celebration cooked by the mgt team.

>Must include everyone, that is if you have the recommendation to fly everyone to Mexico, that is we likely could only send 2 people and most others would not give up their reward to another person...sorry :(

Yes, that is the memo, (all grammatical and other errors are direct from the memo including the frowny face at the end) written by a man with an MBA, and 20+ years as a manager with this company, a company with facilities around the world. Yes, English is his first language. Not, it was not written by a secretary.

Met an awesome Russian tenor. Got drunk with him.,60,5o0gyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5o0gyj/met_an_awesome_russian_tenor_got_drunk_with_him/,5,1484435373.0,"I was nineteen at the time. Right after our equivalent of high school (I'm Swedish) I got a job at a company - that I now realize was pretty fucking shady - where I was to go door to door selling broadband and telephone contracts. We were only paid if we got a sale. I was really ill that Summer, had a nasty infection of the tonsills that just wouldn't go away. Lost 30 pounds due to my inability to eat, my BMI was at 11,5 and I looked like a fucking skeleton. Still, it was my first job and I powered through.

It was a learning experience: never learned some companies simply do not give a fuck about their employees, and that I'll never make it as a salesman. Many days I'd come back to the office with no sales, having knocked on over 200 doors.

Anyway, this particular afternoon I rang the bell to a little house in the nicer suburbs of Gothenburg. I had already made two sales, and I was in a *lot* of pain, so I wasn't really planning on giving my a-game.

The door opens and an overweight, bearded man in his late fifties opens, wearing only his underwear and an open shirt.

A bit wierded out I start giving him my pitch, and he actually looks pretty interested. He invites me inside with a thick Russian accent, and goes to put on some clothes.

As I step in I'm faced with a huge painted portrait of the guy wearing a full evening dress while holding a glass of wine.

>The fuck?

After a long while the guy comes out wearing a suit. ""Ay hosst should nehver by dressed mour poorley than hees gehst,"" he explains (I was wearing my only suit as well, it was standard uniform).

He invites me into the drawing room (we weren't allowed to enter potential clients' homes, but I was really curious where this was going, so fuck it).

Dark leather couches, expensive-looking carpets, classy coffee table, several more paintings of the guy, classical music on the stereo.

>Man, this is how I want to live one day.

We sit down opposite to each other, and continue going through the motions of the sales pitch. I ask him some questions about his current internet speed and whatnot. He stops me.

""Teyll me. Hhonestly. Do you theenk dis is soemthink I need?""

""Right. To be perfectly honest, maybe. Seems to me that your current broadband is fairly slow and this has a speed of [can't remember. Better and cheaper than what he had, though].""

""Fayn. I trahst you. I do noht trahst many sehlspeehple, bat yoo. Yoo seem 'oonest.""

I give him the contract to sign and he instantly turns a door and shouts something in Russian. I almost shit myself, but after a few moments a very tiny woman comes out, puts a bottle of cognac and two glasses on on the table before scurrying off.

""Ees wayf.""

He pours a pretty damn good amount into booth glasses.

""Drink.""

""I'm- I'm not allowed to drink on the job.""

""Noonsens. Both drink beefohr I sign. Eeht's Rahssian way.""

He downs it. I do the same. Then he signs.

Then he starts telling me his life's story. Turns out he used to work in the Soviet Union as a youth. He was scraping the rust off of old submarines at this massive complex. He loved singing and would sing Russian folk songs to his co-workers during lunch break. They all thought he was awesome and encouraged him to take up singing as a profession. Unfortunately that was virtually impossible in the USSR, so he left the country illegally, ended up in West Germany and sang for various jazz bands. Then he somehow got to Sweden, worked a lot of shitty jobs before auditioning for the Gothenburg Opera. Got employed there as a tenor, and has been singing for the opera ever since.

At the conclusion of his story he filled both glasses again.

""Drink. I wehll sink for you.""

""I don't...""

""Drink! Will gehv you flesh. Yoo are jahst skin and bohn.""

I oblige, and he stands up and delivers this fucking amazing performance. I've never found out what it was, but it was in Russian and sounded like a traditional song.

I'm blown away. He sits down again and fills up the glasses.

""I don't think I should...""

""Een Rahssia we zay: Wan drink for yor lehft leg. Wan drink for yor right leg. Ahnd wan drink for yor hehd. Drink.""

I drank. Shortly thereafter I took my good byes of this awesome man and stepped out on the street again, pretty wobbly.

It was a shitty job, but it was worth it solely for that experience.

**Epilogue:** Several years later I was in the foyer at the Gothenburg Opera, and I ran into him again. 

""Aah, the boi who couldn't kehp hee's drink,"" he laughed and bought me a glass of wine at the bar.

The meeting is scheduled for 1-2 - my lunch hour.

In the past, people have frequently tried to schedule things in my lunch hour, so I actually created a recurring appointment in Outlook from 1-2 so I show as busy during that time.  Apparently $VP doesn't use that feature when scheduling meetings.

I reply to all:

> If this is the best time for everyone I can do it, but I normally take lunch at 1.  Can we move this an hour earlier or later?

$VP is the type of person who doesn't respond to emails or instant messages.  I've kind of given up on communicating with him under most circumstances unless I'm face-to-face.  I wait a few hours for a response, get none, and just accept the meeting invite, admitting defeat.

----

Around 12:45 today my Outlook reminder pops up, telling me I have that meeting with $VP, $NewHire, and $Coworker in 15 minutes.  Crap.  I forgot to set a reminder to go to lunch early.  I have 15 minutes to eat.  

Open up my lunch bag and my heart sinks.  Apparently I was distracted when packing lunch this morning.  I took the big cup I usually use for soup, but didn't actually grab any soup.  All I have is a yogurt and two tangerines, and with this meeting I have no time to run out and get something.

I hurriedly eat the yogurt and fruit.  Meeting invite location was at my desk, so I wait for them to come over.

And wait.

And wait.

Twenty minutes after 1, $VP walks in, leading $NewHire and $Coworker.  They have their coats on.  They obviously just returned from lunch out.

It took  2 days to spruce the place up and 2 weeks before I got someone to rent it. We use a variety of online listings and of course get calls from real estate that found my ad online. Now I probably should use a separate free phone number for this sort of thing but my Boss is a bit leery of that. I got a call from one person who found it online.   
I'm also going to do my best to anonymize everything.  

**Chicago**:*Hello!*    
me: Hi.   
**Chicago**:*On craiglist, I see that there is studio in [a county of NYC] for $XXX. Is it still available?*  
me:Yes it is and here is some details.... [details]. Do you have questions?  
**Chicago**:*Yes. I'm currently living in Chicago and I just got a job in NYC working for [a famous group of classical musicans]. So I won't be able to show any current pay stubs, is that a problem?*  
me: No. I'm sure you get something from your new employer that clearly shows that you are now working for them, a phone number and other details of your employment.   
**Chicago**:*Yeah! I already got that. That is relief. Some of the people I talked to was very negative about this. So can I give you a deposit now for the place?*  
me: No. You need to come here and tour the place and take an application if you are still interested. The application fee is not a deposit. It mainly exists to stop people from wasting my time and money by giving away applications that I will never see again and need to replace. The fee is for the use of the application. It's also nonrefundable.   
**Chicago**:*Application. So that means I may not get the studio if I apply.*   
me: That is true. When you submit the application with copies of any of all proofs of ID and income listed within the application, that gets sent to an investigator. The investigator makes sure everything is true, gets some more info and hands it off to my Boss who decides which application will get the studio.     
**Chicago**:*This sounds way too complicated. Do you have any other photos of the place that I can view? I can give you four months in advance if we could skip the process.*   
me: I don't have any other photos than what is on the ad. My Boss still requires potential tenants to view the place in person and go through the application process. We also only take 1st month's rent + security deposit + prorated fee. Nothing more than that and only after an applicant goes through the process and is accepted by my Boss to get the apartment.   
**Chicago**:*Can I make an appointment for this Saturday then?*      
me: I am available to show the studio any day from 9AM to 8PM but you need to call me in the morning of that day your coming to see if it's still available.   
**Chicago**:*That's only 4 days from now. You don't truly expect the studio to go that fast with the complicated process you are following?*    
me: I can't see the future. You can call me in the morning on the day that you are coming if you would like to come see the place.      
**Chicago**:*Okay. Goodbye.*   
me: Bye.   

>So after four days I hand out eighteen applications and receive nothing back. Though I get one couple that returned with a blank application and asked for their money back. I gave it back because I got the blank application back. I ain't a miser. Chicago calls me the morning and tells me that he is on his way but won't be able to see the place until Sunday morning. I tell him to call me again on Sunday.  So Sunday comes and I still don't have any applications. I'm wondering why people like giving their money away when he call me at 8AM to tell me he is standing outside the building and it's a bit chilly out here. 

me: I told you before that I'm available from 9AM to 8PM. I still have to get cleaned up and drive over there.   
**Chicago**:*Oh! No problem. My time is quite precious and I have a few other places I can go see in the meantime.*   
me: Okay. I'll see you at 9AM.   

>At 9AM, I show up and take him inside to look at the place. He looks it over, asks if the rent is negotiable before asking for an application. I tell him that it's not and remind him of the application fee and the application process. I show him the application before he pulls out his money and go over it. I do this because I remembered our conversation four days ago, so I am a bit apprehensive now that he wants to negotiate rent price when he was so willing to hand me four months in advance previously. I assume he probably found a better place or better rent elsewhere.  

**Chicago**:*So here is the money and I here is my ID and let me fill out this application.*   
me: I need a copy of your ID, copys of your documentation and this filled out application. Unfortunately you can't fill it out here since you are not renting this space. Also I don't have a copy machine at this building. So please come back when you have everything.   
**Chicago**:*This is an apartment building right?*     
me: Yes.   
**Chicago**:*You don't have an office here or nearby that will let me do this?*  
me: Unfortunately not.   
**Chicago**:*Look, I got lots of places to look at throughout NYC today. I don't have time to copy my information and fill every application and drop it off.*    
me: I'm sorry but I can't help you. If you are not interested in the studio then we can reverse this transaction now.   
**Chicago**:*Oh no! I'm very much interested in this studio. It's perfect for me. It's just that my time is precious, I'll be here in NYC for a few days before I have to go back to Chicago. I just hoping to get the process started as soon as possible.*  
me: I can't help you. Sorry.    
**Chicago**:*Could I use the bathroom first before I leave.*  
me: No.   
**Chicago**:*Why not?*    
me: I don't have an available public bathroom.     
**Chicago**:*No. This bathroom in this studio.*  
me: Is not a public bathroom. The only person or persons that can use it, is the ones that rent this studio.    
**Chicago**:*Oh. Well I'll see you later then.*     

>He comes back in a hour with the application and copies of his documents. He asks me how many other people applied and how long an investigation process may take. I tell him that it could take a few hours to a day and seventeen people applied but he is the first to return an application.   

**Chicago**:*A few hours to a day? My time is very precious to me. I can't wait around all day outside your building. I have other apartments to look at after all.*   
me: I'm not the investigator or my Boss who decides who gets this apartment.   
**Chicago**:*So you are just an real estate agent.*  
me: No I work for the owner of this property directly. I have an investigator on call that does his job and then hands it off to the Boss. You don't need to hang around since I have no clue how long this investigation may take. You can go look at the other places that you have mentioned.   
**Chicago**:*Yes. I will do that. I'll hopefully hear from you before I leave for Chicago today.*   

>He leaves. I hand off the stuff to my guy while I show off the place to a lot more people that show up to see the place. I get a call two hours later from the applicant. 

**Chicago**:*So.... any progress?*  
me: I'm not the investigator. You will get a call from me today or tomorrow on whether or not you got the place or you are rejected.   
**Chicago**:*Well my time is precious and those are my only copies so I'm going to wait here for awhile.*   
me: okay. Bye. 

>He gave me originals instead of copies of his documents. Either this guy is absent minded or he was too cheap to make a copy of his documents when he made a copy of his ID. And this is guy that wanted to give me four months in advance. He calls me back twenty minutes later asking for his documents back since he can't wait around any longer. I tell him that I handed it to my investigator, who doesn't work at the apartment building. It will take me an hour to get his stuff back. He says that's fine. I hand back his documents minus the application in front of the building. It's windy and cold that day. I wish I remembered to wear my cap.

**Chicago**:*Where is the application?*    
me: As I told you when we were going over the application process, the fee is for the use of the application. The application is still ours. That gets shredded. And if you had handed me copies of your documentation then those copies would have got shredded too.   
**Chicago**:*oh. Can I have the application fee back too?*   
me: That is non-refundable. That is only clearly marked in the listing and the application that you filled out and signed that you understood the application process.    
**Chicago**:*Oh yeah. Well could I use the bathroom?*    
me: No.       
**Chicago**:*It will only be for a second. My time is really precious and I need to head over to the next apartment.*     
me: I do not have the power to let you use that bathroom. Perhaps the next place you go to will have a public bathroom.     
**Chicago**:*I have some money. I really need to use the bathroom. How much?*    
me: No. I have to go. It's way too cold out here. Bye.     

>I head to my car and leave. My super tells me that chicago stood there for a few minutes. Then walked away. He called me back 2 weeks and four days later asking if the studio was still available and if he could apply for it. He expressed his disbelief that the studio was off the market and even more disbelief that I had no other empty apartments.

Before I was offered the position I had 2 minimum wage retail jobs and worked 12hr days 6 days a week. Since working at my new location I have quit one job and kept the other, at a retro video game store. I only work a few hours a week there so lately I have been trying to make it exciting. My most recent shenanigan was playing the 10hr ""What's going on"" He-Man version as long as I could tolerate it. By hour 1 at least 4 people had asked what I was listening to. Around hour 3 is where it got truly funny. A woman had been looking through our DVD section for upwards of an hour. Occasionally I hear her sing some of the lyrics then curse under her breath, as if she is upset at herself. When she finally checked out she says ""Isn't it maddening?"" I say ""Yes, and I had it on 2 hours before you got here."" I then do my best impression of the Jokers laugh and she promptly left the store. Crazy thing is, people now come to the store when I am there because it lightens the mood and loosens people up to get a laugh. 

TL,DR: I don't need this job so I do whatever I want and it has helped business.",2016-12-16 01:57:59

Drunk Puke sex in the men's bathroom. Because of course that happened. NSFW,25,5hh9hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5hh9hu/drunk_puke_sex_in_the_mens_bathroom_because_of/,4,1481328315.0,"Alright! Pretty much gave it away in the title, but I bet you clicked, didn't you?

I used to work for a really popular casino somewhere in North America. I was a bus-boy, or bus bitch, for the food court, but I also brought food all over the casino. 

It's past midnight on a weekend and the casino is pretty dead by this point. No one's ordering food and the club nearby has only a couple drinkers. I notice this particularly inebriated couple walking around but they seem to be keeping it together. Right then, I couldn't really do anything about them. 

A little while later, my buddy on the till needs to relieve himself. Naturally, I take over for him. An inordinate amount of time passes and he returns at a high rate of speed with a indescribable look on his face. Somewhere between laughing, horror, disgust and curiosity. He's so surprised that he's stammering, further exacerbated by having a filipino accent that leans on the staccato side. 

He informed me that while he was in there, he noticed voices from both a woman and a man. He didn't tell me if they were there to begin with, or if they came in after. He was gone a while, so take from that what you will. Moving on, they were in standing doggy position bent over a urinal. The woman had her head somewhat in the bowl, while the man behind her craned his head over her shoulder and puked in the urinal. Immediately after, the woman placed her foot on the lip of the urinal and... presented. To which the man asked her, ""You ready?"" 

Que buddy running as fast as the slippery floor would allow him and we're up to date. 

At this point I'm a little skeptical, but I don't doubt the validity of his claims; as anyone who's ever worked in a casino will tell you, some weird shit happens (From personal experience, a skinny, taller version of Guy Fieri mixed with the cast of 'Jersey Shore' grabbed my wrist in a bathroom once, while Guy Fieri #2 got in one of the stalls. I wound up to punch him in the face and he let go. They did their business together in the stall next to me. It was a little awkward.).

I turn to look at the drunk woman from earlier and she's facing away from me, playing the slot machine. I gesture to her, and buddy nods in agreement. Unsure of what to do, a supervisor/boss walks up and starts complaining about a drunk couple that fell off the bar stools in the club. My buddy and I look at each other, and then we both point at the woman, now staggering across the carpet. My boss verifies that the woman we pointed to is the lady in question. 

We tell the boss about what went down in the bathroom, to which our boss audibly wretches and bends over a garbage can. Security has now become involved, as well as the green team now dispatched to handle the mess in the bathroom. The man appears to have great difficultly maintaining mobility and so both he and the woman are questioned and removed from the casino. I asked the cleaning crew about what they found the bathroom, to which a stern look and no vocal answer was given.

Just another night.

Is there a man here that can take care of it?,71,5h7p8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5h7p8e/is_there_a_man_here_that_can_take_care_of_it/,13,1481213059.0,"An old mail call interaction for you guys from back when I worked the front desk at my job. 

The office I work in has two ways to get in: the front entrance facing the street and the back entrance employees use when they park in our company parking lot. I always park in the back lot versus parking on the street, so if there's anything on the front entrance walkway I'm blissfully unaware to it.

The postmen obviously use the front entrance to come in and drop off the mail. On this day we had one of the alternate mailmen that picks up this route when our regular is off come in and drop off the mail. 


> **Mailman:** You know there's a dead bird by your front door, right? A man should move it.

Unfortunately, there were no men around at that time so I had to risk my delicate frail femininity to grab a shovel and bury the little bird. I've never been the same since.

"""Church doesn't even start this early!""",81,5h099u,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5h099u/church_doesnt_even_start_this_early/,1,1481122122.0,"This happened to my mom, and I thought it was hilarious so I figured I'd post.

&nbsp;

My mom has taken up a life long dream of hers to buy old furniture, fix it up, and resell it for double what she got it for. We're not just talking fixing minor problems here, this woman goes all out. She makes an okay living doing it, it brings her happiness (and she has never been a happy person), so whatever, good for her. She's always been a craft person, so I know doing something she actually likes means a lot to her.

&nbsp;

She uses the usual sites and apps to sell her items. What pisses her off most is people having constant contact, saying “Yeah, I want it, I'll give you a time and date when I can pick it up soon”, replies two days later with a date and time, and then they don't show up at that date and time. 

&nbsp;

The most frustrating time this happened, the lady said she'd come the next day at 10:00am. The next day comes, my mom messages her to verify, she doesn't respond. 10:00am comes and goes, nothing. My mom messaged her around noon and said “If you don't want it, just say so. If you do not get back to me by 6:00pm tonight, I will put the listing back up. Thanks.” The lady gets back to her at 5:55pm, says yes she still wants, can she come get it the next day at 9:00am. My mom tells her “okay, are you sure 9:00am is okay for you? I can do as late as 11:00am.” The woman responds saying 9:00am is perfect, though she might not be there until 9:30am, depending on traffic. My mom says 9:30am would be fine, just once again, no later than 11:00am.

&nbsp; 

The next morning, a Saturday, at 6:00am, the woman calls, waking my mom up. My mom answers and the lady says she's in the driveway. My mom, still half asleep, was like “What? You told me 9:00-9:30” The woman responds “I'm early, can we make this quick?” My mom wakes up my dad, who has to help load, and starts literally praying that she won't hurt somebody all the way down the steps. When my mom got outside, she was trying so hard to not lose it on this poor woman, but made some comments such as: “Would you appreciate if I told you 9am and showed up at your house at 6am?” “I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.” “The sun's not even out” “Church doesn't even start this early” and then starts half whispering the lord's prayer, lmao.

&nbsp;

My mom texted her and apologized later (she fancies herself as a decent Christian woman) but now when she makes sales, she says in her messages “No earlier than X time”. Lesson learned.",2016-12-07 16:48:42
Cleaning up after a sick amusement park patron,29,5gwm46,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5gwm46/cleaning_up_after_a_sick_amusement_park_patron/,1,1481069962.0,"So, one summer in college, I worked at a roadside amusement park a town away from me. I had the privilege of working that Pirate Ship Ride that swings you back and fourth. It was an easy gig, except that you occasionally would have a puker. The first, and thankfully, only time, I had to take care of cleaning vomited up nachos and cotton candy was quite memorable.

   I closed the ride (duh) and found the manager on duty, who was the most stereotypical Motorcycle riding, Marlboro red smoking carny of a guy you can imagine. His instructions to me were as follows: ""Grab a bucket. Go to the fountain in the middle of the park. Fill it up, and dump the water on the puke. Then run the ride."" 

   This seemed like a very ineffective way to clean up vomit, but I did as he said...because, girl, I EARNED that 6.25 an hour. I soon found that the ride slightly titled downwards causing the water to pool in the center of the boat. I also learned, once I began to run the ride, that there was a small hole in the middle of the boat. (I'm assuming to act as a drain when it rained)

   I got to watch in horror as people on the scrambler next to us had the slow realization that they were being showered with puke water.

I was thankful to never have to work that ride again, and even more thankful to get to leave it when the summer ended.",2016-12-07 02:19:22
I Work in Assisted Living - Resident with Schizophrenia and D.I.D. Had A Bad Day,79,5g11gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5g11gu/i_work_in_assisted_living_resident_with/,6,1480649026.0,"I work in the kitchen of an assisted living home with about 60 residents of all ages and walks of life. There's a guy here, we'll call him John, who has multiple personalities and suffers from a partially acid induced Schizophrenic nightmare.

John's backstory; He had multiple identities and hails from a rich family. He bought a LOT of acid and took it all. When his parents came to check on him in the fancy house they bought him, he had the windows barred and tried to kill them. He never came back from his trip and has been living in this acid induced nightmare for over 20 years and has been deemed ""schizophrenic"". One of his ""protectorate"" identities is ""Dad"". Whenever John is threatened, John's ""Dad"" will tell John how to handle the situation. Anytime that John leaves the facility, ""Dad"" takes over. John, to this day, believes that his ""Dad"" buys his smokes. Overall, I'm told that John is only 25% John. The rest is taken over by his other identities, of whom I'm not aware of meeting any.

Here's my story;

I was warned a lot that John would try to intimidate me as I was new. Over the first couple of months, I never, EVER had any problems with John. He always said hello to me. None of his other identities showed up, that is, until one day. I came to work and I wasn't exactly having the best of days, which for me, is rare. I'm always really nice to all of the residents. So, I went about my job, filling their water, getting juices, filling coffee without my usual smile. At one point or another, I remember looking up at John and I suppose if I were John, I could see how it was like a scowl more than anything. 

So, about 5 minutes go by and he gets up suddenly and leaves. About 20 minutes later, John comes walking around the corner and says to me, ""My dad wants to talk to you"". At that point, I wasn't really sure how to react because I knew he meant his protectorate. So, I said, ""Alright, John. I'll talk to your dad, but I need to finish what I'm doing, first"". He looked at me for a second with a weird, almost empty-eyed expression before snapping back to John, full of life and said, ""Have a good day"", and scurried away. I really didn't think much of it then, so I just kept on working.

Later on, when I was serving his table next to him, he said something really quietly. I stopped what I was doing to avoid angering him anymore and went closer. When I was within ear-shot, I asked him, ""What'd you say, John? I couldn't hear you."" and he yelled, ""You need to erase the attack you did to me""! I was surprised, so I gave him a really confused look trying to figure out what he meant by attack. Before I could say anything, he said it again; ""You need to erase the attack you did to me. My dad told me I could tell you that"". At that point I knew that it was the scowl. It HAD to be scowl because I've never so much come within 3 feet of John, let alone attack him. I said, ""I'm sorry, John. I didn't mean to attack you. I erase the attack,"" and his aggression disappeared instantly. 

Before I left work that day, I went to go smoke in the courtyard. I was finally having a better day. I was ready to go home. And then a friend of mine starts texting me about this petty drama that I was SO not in the mood for. As I was angry-reading her message to me, John comes walking out to have a cigarette. I didn't notice him at first, but I finally look up and he says, ""You know. Your friend is the one that likes me. You treat me like shit!"" And that... That was when I realized what was happening. John is so used to having other identities that he believes that it's normal for everyone to have them. He assumed that my bad mood was another identity of mine and ""my friend"" was my normal, peppy and cheery self. So I said to him, ""I don't treat you like--"". He walked away. He wasn't having it. So, I got up, and I went home.

Since then, I always make sure to smile at him and make sure to avoid looking at him if I'm having a bad day. Since that day, he hasn't come to me about talking to his dad or treating him like shit. So, I guess I have my recipe for a Happy John. I just thought this would be a story worth sharing. I'm thinking about doing a series of stories like this one from other residents because there are a lot! Tell me what you think.


TL;DR - John has lots of identities and drug induced schizophrenia. His ""Dad"" personality wanted to talk to me. Told me I ""Needed to erase the attack"" I didn't do to him (I accidentally scowled at him in a bad mood). Then told me I treated him like shit because he thought my bad mood was like one of his identities, someone different, based on how I was acting. Thought it was interesting & worth sharing. Want me to do more? Let me know.",2016-12-02 05:23:46

For those who don't know what a CNA is,it's a Certified Nursing Assistant and what that means is I work at a nursing home and take care of those who stay there and call it their home. Well I work night shift and don't let anyone tell you night shift is dead silent. I was working one night and noticed a call light was hit which means someone needed assistance. I head over and see my residents with some kind of cream on his...nether area and black gloves which our building does not even have. I stare for a second and ask the gentleman what is the problem and he informs me that his privates were burning something bad. I see a bottle of Nair on his nightstand and sigh for those who do not know what Nair is a hair removal lotion which is NOT supposed to be near your privates because it basically burns the hair right off with the chemicals. So here I am not knowing what to do because I never thought something like this would happen. I go and get the nurse and she says the only thing I can do is clean it with cold water and see if I can get as much of it all off as possible. I proceed to clean it up while my resident is screaming bloody murder,angry at me for using a cold rag to clean up the area that is burning. I explain that the only reason it would be burning is because he might have extreme skin irritation and I was not planning on using hot water to clean the area and proceeded telling him I was almost done and I am sorry for the pain. Needless to say some of the skin on his..for a lack of better words balls of fire had been damaged and he was bleeding slightly. After about an hour of me icing and reducing the bleeding to a stop he thanked me after and told me sorry repeatedly for his actions. 
I do in fact love my job because it has never been a boring night since I got hired.",2016-11-22 09:15:25

She called me to tell me that she hired and paid a repairman to fix her stove and he told her to replace it. I went out there to check the stove. Just ensuring that the lighters, the oven and everything works or if it truly become a gigantic paperweight. The only thing wrong was that it wasn't plugged in. I checked it after plugging it in.   
*Tenant*: I need new oven. Repairman says it's broken.  
Me: Who unplugged it?  
*Tenant*: I did! I took it out because my electric bill is too high! It's always running!  
Me: The oven doesn't use electricity if you don't use the controls. ~this model doesn't even have an clock on it.   
*Tenant*: I need new stove! Repairman says it's broken!  
Me: What's wrong with it?  
*Tenant*: It doesn't turn on!   
Me: You have to plug it in. This stove is completely electric. There is no gas line.   
*Tenant*: My sister's stove works without it being plugged in! She uses a lighter to light the stove.   
Me: That's because that stove has a gas line. This building does not have gas lines running to each apartment. This stove works when plugged in. I'm not giving you a new stove.   

I leave. I get called back a few days later and this time she has the repairman with her.   
*Repairman*: This stove is broken. ~he twists the control knob for one the stove's heating elements and it doesn't turn on~    
Me: Is it plugged in?  
*Repairman*:  I'm not an idiot. This stove is broken.    
Me: Excuse me. ~ I push the stove over and show the repairman that the stove isn't plugged in. He gets embarrassed, apologizes and leaves.   
*Tenant*: The stove is broken! I had to buy a portable electric stove to cook.   
Me: It's not broken. You need to plug it in.   

I leave. She calls the owner. The owner asks me what's going on. He heads over to see the tenant and the same story occurs again. He decides to leave it alone. If she wants to use a portable electric stove on top of a working unplugged electric stove, that's her business not ours.

Ugh Manager did a complete 180 after I got hired,52,5cj0p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5cj0p0/ugh_manager_did_a_complete_180_after_i_got_hired/,3,1478927515.0,"Ugh so
I got a job at a burrito place. During the interview, the manager was AWESOME. Nice, funny, optimistic. I was like ""oh yeah, I hit the jackpot, no more dealing with shitty managers"". He also stressed the fact that he trained all his new employees. 

I got hired 2 hours after the interview through a phone call and he made me an account to start online training.

After completing hours of online training and paying to get a ""Responsible Service of Alcohol' certificate to my name. He texts me (after the first call, he would only communicate through text) that my first shift will be on so-and-so day and so-and-so time, to wear a certain style of clothes ( I had to buy them) and that I will be provided an apron on the day.

So I show up for my shift, keen to finally make money again.

What ends up happening;

Me (to an employee): Hey, is so-and-so (manager) here?

Them: Um no, they don't work on this day. What are you after?

Me: Oh they said to come in and they would train me. It's my first shift.

Them: Oh

*awkward silence*

*awkward 30 minutes while I sit on a chair in the kitchen and they try to figure out what to do*

Turns out they had no idea I was starting that day or that I was new. 

Luckily another lovely employee stepped in and trained me.

After my shift, I texted my manager (he would only communicate with me through text, except for the time he hired me) and asked if he would be there for my next **training** shift in order to fill out paperwork for pay, availability,etc. He texted back that he would email me the bank form and to text him the availability. No mention if he would train me or not. (I ended up checking next weeks roster and he was not going to be working that day.)

I still have not recieved the bank form, therefore no pay for working and I have already spent a good amount of money on a uniform and on my certificate. I am seriously starting to doubt this manager and this work place. I get that maybe he is too busy to train me but damn let my 'co-workers' know that someone new at least! ",2016-11-12 07:11:55
I want to scream,48,5b50px,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5b50px/i_want_to_scream/,6,1478281487.0,"Throwaway because I'm paranoid.

For the most part I like my job. I'm a lab assistant in a community college biology lab. It's flexible, I have minimal human interaction, my boss is laid back, and I can have side projects as long as I get all my work done. I have to interact with work studies, but it wasn't that bad until I got the computer.

The thing is, I didn't want the computer. I bring my own laptop to work every day, but most days, my phone is enough for whatever I need to do online. But for some reason, my boss insisted that I NEEDED it. Well okay. If he wanted to waste his time making the IT department bring this desktop up, I'm not going to stop him. 

All the work studies flocked to it. I didn't mind, since I had no intention of using it. And I still wouldn't mind if they weren't so rude about it. Models were left on and around my desk; someone left their graded homework and tests there for weeks before I finally tossed it in the recycle bin; on one instance, a work study came in and said to the one currently using the computer, ""you're sitting in my seat."" I had multiple talks with them about etiquette and how this wasn't their house and they needed to be more considerate of the space they were using. I don't use it but the space still didn't belong to them. 

Today I came in and put my things down in my chair. We don't really have a formal coat room or anything where we put our coats and backpacks so they just go in chairs or on tables in the front. It gets a little messy but usually it hasn't been a problem before. When I put my things in my chair, they move it to the table so they can sit and use the computer. I don't mind this. Except today, someone dropped my scarf on the floor and neglected to pick it up. The woman sitting at the computer stared at it and went ""sorry I didn't see that.""

I wanted to scream. I have eczema, and mt skin is sensitive. We work in a level two biohazard. I culture pathogenic bacteria. Even in a different setting, it would be unacceptable to treat another person's things like this. How are you going to drop someone's things on the floor, step on it, and pretend you don't notice. We let them get away with a lot here that they'd normally be fired for in another workplace. The least they could do is not be garbage humans. As the semester progresses, I feel like I'm getting more and more attitude from these people and I feel like it's because I'm young because this can't possibly be how these middle aged women with husbands and children would act at a ""real job.""",2016-11-04 19:44:47
Simple before complex. Commonsense right? Wrong...,32,5b2d0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5b2d0b/simple_before_complex_commonsense_right_wrong/,4,1478246163.0,"I'm an apartment manager who also does some simple repair work. One day an tenant who is an IT professional, taught me that my way of thinking isn't commonsense. The tenant called me up to complain that his bedroom's fan light isn't working. I asked him if he changed the bulbs to which he replied, ""I'm not an idiot. The fan ain't working, you need to replace it or fix it."" I try to set up an appointment for the super to look at it but the tenant is very resistant to idea and is angry. I finally get him to calm down and get him to at least let me see it. I take a small toolbag with me just in case. If it's simple fix, I can usually take care of it quickly. 

He shows me the bedroom. The fan is connected to two wall switches. One for the fan and the other for the light on the fan. The fan works but the light doesn't. It's probably the switch and after flicking the switch, I realize that the switch gone bad. I decide to replace the switch. The tenant shouts at me. ""What are doing? The FAN is the problem!"" I stop what I'm doing and tell him that I'm addressing the problem just give me a few minutes.   

He shouts at me, ""Look, I'm in IT. I do trouble shooting all freaking day. I know what I'm talking about. The problem is clearly the fan and not the switch. You need to concentrate on the fan, take it down and either fix it or replace it. "" I ask him if in his line of work, does he first start with complicated solutions before trying the simple solutions first for a problem. He tells me to not tell him how to do his job. I go back to replacing the switch. He calls my boss to complain about me.   

While he's doing that, I find that it was the switch. I inform the tenant and leave. My boss later tells me that I should have put the original switch back, tell the tenant that he will get a repair order set up and left the apartment. Then set appointment time for the following week. Or two weeks.
_______________________  

[Edit 1]  
I also realize now after talking to the super that he just wants a new fan because his neighbor recently had a fan installed in his bedroom. He has been pestering the super about it ever since. Tenants are like that. They see somebody get something and then they want something too even if their stuff still works.    

[Edit 2]  
I was right. He has told me that he has seen the fan and we wants an upgrade. So we gave him an ""upgrade."" We know the fan is the same model as his neighbor. The blades on the fan is reversible with a different design on the other side, so we just cleaned the fan and reversed the blades when we wasn't home. He's overjoyed.",2016-11-04 09:56:03

I am a male but I work in a female-dominated position (data entry) as part of a large agency.  The agency sent out a letter stating that some female-dominated positions, such as data entry, were determined to be underpaid compared to male contemporaries and they would be doing an equity raise to fix this.  The letters went out in mid-October and we were to find out our raise today.

The raise was 2 cents.  I got $30 in back pay (I've been here for about 16 months) after taxes.  Now we're all pissed, and the stupid thing is it could have been avoided.  If they hadn't said anything initially (and implied that it would be at least a little significant, since they asked us not to speak to any other departments about it) and just said ""Hey, we've made a slight change to your pay"" or whatever, then fine.

That time a boater tried to get me fired and I got to lay the smackdown,79,5a73zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5a73zi/that_time_a_boater_tried_to_get_me_fired_and_i/,5,1477848441.0,"Hello again!

I work as the dockmaster for a privately-owned marina. I previously posted [a list of excuses people try to use to get out of paying for docking](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/56ce6l/excuses_from_the_docks/). I was going to wait until that dropped off the front page to post my first actual tale, but this sub seems to move slowly, so what the hell.

This one happened a couple of years ago. It's the Canada Day long weekend - the first weekend of the July-August stretch which is the busiest part of the boating season.

The docking wall is completely packed with overnight vacationers. It's so busy that boats are tying to each other (rafting) since they can't find space on the wall (which they still have to pay for but that's not relevant to this story).

A little 20-foot powerboat has squeezed itself into a gap. There's a guy in his 20s and a guy in his 50s. We'll call the younger guy **Angry**. I'm the dockmaster, **DM**.

> **DM**: Hi there! Welcome to [name of docking wall]. We do charge for mooring. Are you planning to stay the night?

> **Angry**: Oh, no. We're just here for lunch.

> **DM**: Okay. Since this is a long weekend and the wall is packed, we're not offering the usual rate for a short stay - only the overnight rate is available. You've already been here for a couple of hours, so I'm going to have to charge you the full rate. *(Note: this has been policy for years, and it's clearly posted on all signage and paperwork)*

> **Angry**: But I'm only staying for lunch. I want the day rate.

> **DM**: Sorry, as I've explained, only the overnight rate is available on long weekends. 

> **Angry**: I just want to stay for a couple of hours for lunch. I'm not paying a fucking overnight rate.

> **DM**: I understand, but if you're not going to pay I'll have to ask you to leave and free up this space for another boat who will pay.

> **Angry**: Who the fuck do you think you are? Fucking faggot. I want to talk to the fucking manager.

> **DM**: I'm the head dockmaster. I'm in charge here.

> **Angry**: I don't give a fuck who you are. You report to someone. I want to talk to him.

> **DM**: You can talk to me.

> **Angry**: FUCK YOU, I want to talk to your boss.

> **DM**: *shrug* Okay. Here's the phone number for the marina office. Ask for **G**.

> **Angry**: I'm going to get you *fired*, you little shit. You're fucking *done*.

 I've been working here for years. The docking wall where I work is separate from the main marina, so to get the job in the first place I needed a recommendation from an existing marina staff member that I was trustworthy. I don't mean to brag, but my numbers are always perfect, I get the job done more quickly than any other staff they've had in the past, and the regulars go out of their way to leave good feedback. In fact **G** has told me that if I ever have to leave for any reason, I'll always have a job here if I want it back, no questions asked. 

So in short I know my boss has my back 100% of the time and I'm not even remotely worried about angry complaints. I do my best to keep complaints on the wall with me since I am the head dockmaster and **G** is very busy, but every once in a while there's someone who just won't take no for an answer.

> **Angry**: *(on the phone, suddenly calm and friendly)* Hello, is this **G**? Hi. I'm at [docking wall] and I just want to stay for lunch, but your dockmaster is refusing to give me the hourly rate. He's shouting and swearing and trying to kick me out. He's being extremely unprofessional and rude, I can't believe you employ staff like this ...yes... yes... I see... Oh, thank you. Thank you sir. Have a wonderful day.

> **Angry**, smugly: He said I could stay at the hourly rate and to see him when you get back to the office.

I had pulled out my phone to text **G** as soon as I'd given **Angry** the phone number for the office. As soon as I heard Angry's shift to the overly calm friendly voice, I knew good shit was going to go down. This text conversation happened in parallel to **Angry**'s phone call:

    DM: Heads up, you're about to get a call from an angry boater. He doesn't want to pay full rate to stay for lunch on the long weekend.

    G: again?

    DM: Everything he's saying is a lie. He's been going off on me, yelling and insulting and swearing.

    G: lol what an ass

    DM: He's telling me you gave him the hourly rate?

    G: haha i told him to fuck off and never come back and hung up on him

And now back to the boater:

**Angry**: So you're giving me the hourly rate.

**DM**: Actually I just spoke to **G**. You lied to me. You need to leave right now, and you are no longer welcome here.

**Angry**: What --

**DM**: Leave right now or I'm calling the police to file a trespassing report.

So at this point **Angry** storms off and starts packing up his lunch things. The older man I mentioned at the start has been standing uncomfortably off to the side, but now approaches me. He quietly apologizes to me for his son's behaviour.

They leave without further incident.

Later **G** and I laugh about it and pass the story on to the rest of the staff.",2016-10-30 19:27:21
When the RCO gets bored. (Or: Why I can't be left to my own devices.),38,5a6b0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5a6b0f/when_the_rco_gets_bored_or_why_i_cant_be_left_to/,3,1477838620.0,"Not sure how many parts these stories will end up being, but I thought I'd share some from the time I worked as an RCO.  RCO is short for ""Remote Control Operator.""  Basically it's a type of a locomotive engineer, but we use a remote control pack to control the train.  Only used for switching and yard purposes though. Never on the main line.

I'd been working at the mill for a good six months when the locomotive got sidelined due to a minor accident. Well...not minor, but no one was hurt. It did end up being kinda funny too, but I digress.

Wanting to consolidate things into a cheaper system, the company picked up a used shuttlewagon truck.  Essentially a locomotive that could also drive on the roads with rubber tires. 

I tended to work nights, and found that unlike the locomotive, this thing made switching VERY easy.  So it wasn't uncommon for me to have long moments where I was bored out of my mind while waiting for the hoppers, or tank cars to be loaded or unloaded.  This would prove to result in some very interesting escapades, including several parking tickets, and one young man's car trying to climb its way up a tree.  That's the story I'm about to relate.

So, one summer night, I'm sitting in the cab when I get a call to take a string of six cars out to the interchange.  I couple up and dutifully trundle my way down the mile and a half long siding to reach the small interchange yard we had with the local railroad.  About halfway down, I notice this car parked on the private access road.  Honestly, I didn't think much of it.  It happened from time to time that people would get lost and end up on our little road.  Typically it only took them a few moments before they sorted out where they were and headed off property.  It takes me a good half hour to tie down the cars, set the brakes, and then use the gravel pad (really just an old out of use crossing) to raise the rail wheels and get set up for road travel. 

Bouncing back down the access road, I discover that the car is STILL there, and it's blocking my path.  That's when I hit upon an idea.  I'm bored, and I want to have some fun.  This will be fun.  It will also be mean, but it's still fun.

I quickly kill the road lamps, and pull up within twenty feet or so from the front bumper of the car.  Waiting a moment, I flick the train lights on, turn them on high beam, and rev the engine while the wagon is in neutral, all the while giving the train horn a long honk.

The light fills the interior of the car, and I have a perfect view of what's going on.  I see one of the local teens look up, his eyes the size of saucers.  Some girl's head comes up and looks up, her mouth open in a wide scream.  The next thing I see is the car suddenly power itself full speed in reverse, jump the ditch at the side of the access road, and try to climb one of the trees (in reverse) along side that ditch.  The kid is freaking out at this point, screaming bloody murder, while I'm laughing my ass off in the cab.

Next few hours were spent talking with the local police, who found the whole deal rather funny, while the teen swore up and down that his mother was going to kill him, since he'd taken the car without telling her.  I also got the impression that his bowels had voided themselves at the sudden sight, while he was thanking me profusely for managing to stop the train before it hit him.

I never told him the truth.  My bosses ended up calling me on the carpet for this one, noting that while my method of dealing with trespassers was effective...they'd rather I just stuck to calling the local PD out to deal with it, as opposed to taking things into my own hands.

TLDR:  Used a road capable rail car mover's lights and horn make a kid on ""lover's lane"" think he was about to be run down by a train, causing him to wreck his car trying to get away.",2016-10-30 16:43:40
My Coworker Thinks That all Frenchmen are Raunchy now,29,59yuru,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/59yuru/my_coworker_thinks_that_all_frenchmen_are_raunchy/,0,1477714493.0,"TL;DR: I swear a lot in this post, it was just something extremely random that happened at work because I decided to sing in french and gave my coworker the raunchy translations to the song.

So, I was working today and felt like singing, but instead of singing in English like usual, I figured I would sing a few songs I learned from my family out east. My coworker was standing behind me and could hear me singing, I will call him W, and seemed pretty interested in it, this was the exchange we had:

>Me: -singing- Estit d'criss de tabarnac, estit d'criss de diable

>W: That sounds pretty cool, what's it mean?

>Me: Roughly translates to god-damn fucking son of a bitch, god damn fucking son.

>W: Oh...

About ten minutes pass from there when I transitioned into another song, which lasts about five minutes and is meant to sound like a love song. He was quietly laughing under his breath because he knows I dislike love songs and asked me:

>W: Alright, what does all that mean?

>Me: it roughly translates to ""you are ugly as hell, but I still sorta like you""

At this point, he just shook his head and laughed a bit. I didn't launch into another song till near the end of my shift because I knew if anyone heard me and understood, I'd be up shit creek without a paddle. I sung the two minute tune and was almost immediately asked for the translation, so here is what I told him:

>Me: It roughly translates to ""She says sure, she says well, she says show me the size, show me the size of your puny ass dick, I say run before I fuck you with my giant ass dick, I don't want her no more so I fucked her in the ass""

So now he wants me to sing every day when I'm at work, and I'm alright with that.",2016-10-29 07:14:53

Back story, I do a bit of bidding and project managing/coordinating whatever you want to call it. I have this really terrible project that, when still in the bidding phase, I did not want to touch. My boss (the owner of the company) thought we might need it during the time frame it was slotted to start in order to keep our guys busy. Knocked a GOOD chunk off the price to get the contract. 

&nbsp;

The architect has been requesting a whole bunch of add-ons to work we're doing. So we provide the general contractor, who is the middle-man in all of this, with pricing for each additional item. Never hear back; never receive any approval. I probably sent reminders to the GC over 10 times that these items are still pending.

&nbsp;

Well now we're in the last week of being and site, they haven't approved diddly squat. The architect is getting mad at us because the additional work hasn't been done. We try to get the ball rolling on some of the items they're really adamant about, but my boss of course, like any sane person, wants it in writing they understand they are going to have to pay XYZ. 

&nbsp;

Today I get the call from the head honcho over at the GC, pretty much to yell at me. She's GC for general contractor and I'm me:

> **GC:** I was out of town, but I'm looking over the pricing you re-sent to the office and this is just ridiculous. 

> **Me:** Okay, what can I go over with you to help?

> **GC:** I don't see why X is going to take so long to do. *scoffs* There's no reason for it to cost that much, I'm not forwarding that to architect for approval.

> **Me:** I completely understand. We were weary of where our price came out at too. I clarified with our tech in the field several times and he is standing his ground that we need X amount of hours.

> **Me:** Per him he has to coordinate with X contractor and help them, etc. *Explains process of work and that this change was requested after everything had already been done. The walls and ceiling would need to be taken down and the space was a lot tighter to work in with everything installed.* 

> **GC:** WHATEVER. THAT ASIDE, THESE OTHER ITEMS NEED TO GET STARTED NOW. 

> **GC:** I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU JUST DIDN'T DO THEM ALREADY. 

> **GC:** I'll send over approval or whatever you wanted, but my question to you is WHAT DO YOU CARE WHO PAYS YOU?!!

> **Me:** I'm sorry?

> **GC:** *still yelling* Whether I'm paying you or X contractor pays you or whatever, what does it matter to you?!! You're going to get paid! 

> **Me:** I'm sorry, I can't advise on that. I just know per *Owner's Name*, he wants it in writing.

> **GC:** THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS! Given our past relationship we shouldn't need to put it in writing you should just do the work!

> **Me:** Again I'm sorry, I can't really speak to that. That is something you would need to talk with *Owner's Name* about, I do not control that. Personally, I believe it's just to protect all of us especially since there have been so many issues with this job.

> **GC:** FINE. I guess I'll send that over because YOU want to make such a big deal over it. I don't get it though, this is nothing, *random past job that I had nothing to do with* was a complicated job. This isn't complicated, but you're making it that. You're holding up the job!!

> **Me:** Would you like to speaker with the owner?
 
> **GC:** NO, I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT. JUST GET IT DONE. *Hangs up*

tl;dr General contractor yells at me because she doesn't understand why we don't just do thousands of dollars in work without any approval. We should just be cool, but she's still going to argue with me over pricing and us holding up the job when they don't respond for over a month.",2016-10-25 21:02:16

It was never really made clear in the four months I held this position. My tasks were to deliver/pick up equipment at jobsites, pick up new equipment, fully arm the fleet of lane closure trucks with the proper gear, pick up new trucks, dropped off old ones, clean the warehouse, answer all calls and emails when the manager was away, program and deliver CMS boards (those orange LED message boards you see at/near construction sites), and in case of emergency, sent out as a temporary traffic control person/flagger.  Aside from these duties, I was sent on a number of tasks outside of my job description, from delivering checks to the city engineering department, to picking up coworkers lunches, to building ikea beds, and refueling the owner's personal work truck. 

Last week, I received a call from one of our lane closure technician (LCT), who had a problem with her truck:

LCT - ""my truck shakes when I go to turn it on. I've tried to call (my boss' name) and tried texting her, but she's not answering! What should I do? Can you get a hold of her for me?""

NoxPrime - I'm not too sure what to do in this situation. But I can try and get ahold of her for you. Let me know if you need anything else. 

I hung up, and texted my boss. I didn't hear anything back from her for the rest of the night, so I'm thinking ""cool, problem solved.""

The next day, I get into work, and my boss asks me why I told the LCT that I couldn't help her. What? I told my boss what had happened, and she understood, but the owner was pissed. 

Boss - *owners name* wanted me to fire you. I told him no, because you're needed here, and and you've never done anything wrong. I called the LCT when I got out of a meeting, and she told me not to worry, the owner was helping me. So I texted him, and he said ""anything for you! :)"". This morning, I get in, and he's floating 10 feet off the ground pissed.""

Wow. I'm a Deadman over not knowing what to do in a situation I've never dealt with before. My boss tells me if that ever happens again, I'm to pick up one of our spare trucks, and drive it out to the lct, even at the risk of stranding myself wherever that location may be. Ok, now I know. 

I head upstairs to the owner's office. I get up there and he immediately calls me and the GM into his office. 

NoxPrime - I just wanted to come up here to apologize for the misunderstanding. I now know what the procedure is in that type of situation, and it won't happen again. 

This is where he starts to verbally rip a strip out of me. Talking about how much of an inconvenience it was for him to drive out to pick her up, and set her up with a new truck. How I told her I can't help her and how he pays me well to know what the fuck to do when it comes to my job.  I again apologize and guarantee it won't happen again.  Everything seems to be OK. I go and air my grievences with HR. She comforts me by saying I can't get fired like that. That there's a long process since I'm part of management. There'd be several HR meetings first, followed by write-ups.  That was two Mondays ago. 

Fast forward to this week. On tuesday, I was asked to assist in building two ikea beds for our dispatch workers that were required to stay overnight. Assisting meant building them by myself. So I started. I got one half done before having to drive signs out to a location that took 1.5 hours Roundtrip. I get back, and complete the rest of it, with only a couple short vape breaks throughout the process, which took short of 4 hours  to complete. Wednesday, I awoke throughout the night vomiting, as I had caught the flu my daughter so graciously brought home from school. My boss agreed with me not spreading it at work. Hours later, she texts me saying I have a meeting with HR the next  morning

Thursday morning. 9am. I get in, and the receptionist says that the owner wants to talk to me. Fuck. I go upstairs again, and he calls me and the GM in again. He's pissed, and I could see his face turning red behind the spraytan.

Owner - have a seat. I've decided to let you go. How the fuck do you tell an lct that you won't help her. I went to bed last night pissed off at you! I pay you to do a task, and you have your boss do your job? (Boss's name) came in early yesterday to put that bed together you didn't bother to come in to do. 

Noxprime - I thought we resolved the lct issue last week, and you're harping on Mr a week later about....

Owner - harping? Really? You're going to say that to me?!

Noxprime - harping, bitching, well seeing as how you're ""letting me gooo"", what do I have to lose, really? 


Cue the yelling back and forth between owner and myself. 


Owner - (pauses for a minute) do you like your job? *yes. Up until this moment, I loved it*  I'm giving you another chance. You have kids, I have kids. One more fuck up and you're gone. Now get the fuck out of my office and do your job. 


I head out, and off to help a flagger with a message board. On the way I have an emotional breakdown. I call my fiancé and fill her in on what happened. I tell her I'm done with the company. She agrees. I call my mother, and after explaining what happened, I secure some emergency funds to help me until I secure a new job so I don't have to dip into my savings. I get back to the office,  inform my friendly coworkers of my decision before meeting with the gm and hr. I tell them that I feel I'm being bullied lately, and I won't be having they. I'm using my last chance to take the high road for myself, and quit. Cue the violin music and the tears from a couple people. 

It's Friday. I picked up my last cheque today, and I haven't felt this happy in quite a while. 


Tl;dr: fired. Yelled at boss, given second chance. Quit. Booyakasha.",2016-10-22 08:14:29
You back up. No! YOU!,35,588ox6,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/588ox6/you_back_up_no_you/,14,1476854682.0,"I don't usually do this work, so it's not MY job, but it is a job.

  I live in a mostly rural area.  I have a friend who farms.  My job allows me to be schedule-flexable.  He asked me to help one afternoon on picking corn.  Sure, I love driving combines! (no, really, I do)

  I finish one field and am about to move onto the next.  Since I only have to run on road across this small bridge of around 75 feet across (over a ""river"" that is about 10 feet wide this time of year), I decided to keep the 12 row corn head on.  I'm only going to be on the road for the length of the bridge and then I'm back in the field.

  Yeah, you out there already laughing can see what is going to happen.  Just past half way across, that's when it happens.  Oncoming traffic.  Guess it hid behind a bug splat on my windshield.

  I try to wave it back.  Not budging.  Toot the horn.  Nope.  Now I'm 40k pounds, 30 feet across (15 without the head anyways).  Versus a Honda.  I have to get out, standing on the steps and yell at this... thing.

>It: Well, then move over!

>It: I'm not that big. 

Please note: I'm overhanging the guard rails with the head as high up as I can.

>M: Just move!

Yeah, lost my cool.  I put it in gear and inched forward.  It got the hint.  I got into the field and got working.  Two loops later, I see a Sheriff's squad with the lights on and a deputy leaning against it.  It called the cops on me.  Said I chased him *Oh! It was MALE?!*.  Muddy field saved my bacon- my tire tracks were still on the bridge.  Deputy heard my side, saw the tracks.  He waggled his finger at me.  ""Don't do it again.  Have a nice day.""

I just found out that she's been telling people that I'm not coming back to work after I have my baby and that they should say goodbye to me now. She was warning all the new hires not to get attached to me or to depend on me too much. I am definitely coming back to work after I have my baby, if for no other reason than to constantly undermine her attempts for authority with my very presence, as I'm apparently currently doing.

---------------------------------

Another coworker came back from maternity leave a few months ago, and when she did she approached me to ask if This Bitch has said anything about my weight. Apparently, when this other coworker was nine months pregnant, This Bitch told her that her face was looking ""puffy"" and that ""it might be time to start watching what you eat.""

---------------------------------

She also told a manager (not our manager, but a manager) that he had gained weight since getting married, to his face, completely unprompted. He wasn't even engaging with her at the time, he was just passing by her cube and she felt the need to inform him of this. 

-----------------------------------

She once, also completely unprompted, asked a coworker if she was pregnant. The coworker was not pregnant, and was very confused. This Bitch explained that she had had a premonition that the coworker was pregnant, that her premonitions always come true, and that the coworker should practice safe sex.

Not only did the coworker not become pregnant, but when I *did* get pregnant several months later, she failed to psychically detect the fetus and had to be told I was, like everyone else. 

----------------------------------

She has decided that she hates one of the new hires, and she told him that, had he been assigned to sit next to her, he would've had to move. He wasn't assigned to sit next to her, but she wanted him to know anyway, that if he *had* been, he would've had to move.

----------------------------------

Lately, ever since her decision that she's going to be a supervisor, she's been treating interactions between myself and her as though they are supervisor-subordinate interactions, not coworker-coworker interactions. For example, today I asked her a clarifying question about a task we were both doing, and she responded by saying that she ""didn't have time to keep track of me."" Then we both returned to doing the exact same activity at the same level of urgency. 

----------------------------------

She's also started trying to intercept people who come to me to ask questions so that she can answer their questions instead. I guess because she's the ""senior"" agent or because I'm pregnant or something.

-----------------------------------

Speaking of, she's also *really, really* invested in catching me having pregnancy brain. So much so that she's inserting herself into my conversations with other people to blame things on my pregnancy, in the same way someone might blame things on a woman being on her period. I can no longer be tired, uncertain, irritated, hungry, or need to take a #2 without it being evidence of how pregnancy is crippling me. ",2016-10-08 00:03:03
Excuses from the docks,71,56ce6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/56ce6l/excuses_from_the_docks/,10,1475859575.0,"I work as the dockmaster for a privately-owned marina. This first post isn't a specific tale, but rather, a quick overview of how docking works, followed by all the excuses people use to try to get out of paying. If there's interest, I can post some actual tales.

City bylaw states that all docking must be paid; refusal to pay constitutes trespassing and offending boats may be towed at the owner's expense. Boats pay for docking based on the length of the boat. There's a fee for a short stay, and a higher fee for overnight. The fee is for docking only - all services (power, water, washrooms, showers) are provided free of charge and operated not by the marina, but by the city parks department. The docking wall itself is considered marina property, leased from the city. Everything else is city park. Marina members who pay a seasonal rate at the main marina can stay on the wall for free, as long as they let the office know how long they'll be staying (so the marina can rent out the vacant docks).

So here are some of the excuses I've heard:

> The power at this location isn't working / the showers are closed / I don't have convenient access to a water hookup. I'm not paying / I should get a discount.

Sorry, but the fee is for docking only. Other services are offered free of charge as a courtesy. It's a very busy area and there are plenty of people who will be happy to pay the full rate regardless of the status of the services. You'll either have to pay or leave.

> The weather is too rough / my engine is damaged. I'm stuck, I couldn't leave even if I wanted to, I shouldn't have to pay.

I'm sorry, that's a shame. But space is at a premium. There are plenty of safe, calm, sheltered areas for you to anchor for free, and the area is sheltered enough that there is no danger in moving the boat a short distance. If you want to stay on the wall, you have to pay the docking fee.

> I have no cash.

No problem, we have a portable debit/credit card machine.

> I forgot my wallet.

Sorry, it's city bylaw that all docking must be paid. If you can't or won't pay, I'll have to ask you to leave.

> I have a deal with the manager. 

Then why didn't he tell me about you or your deal when I spoke with him this morning?

> I get the seniors/group/disability discount.

There are no such discounts. Everyone pays the same rate.

> But I'm not tied to the wall, I'm tied to this other boat because there was no space left on the wall.

Sorry, that's known as rafting, and bylaw and regulations state you pay the same rate for rafting. You're free to move anywhere you like at no additional charge if space opens up, but if we provide a discount for rafting, people will do it even when there is open space.

> I work for the city, I don't have to pay.

That's nice, but you still have to pay. This is a private business.

> I'm friends with the mayor. He told me it was free. I'll talk to him and have you fired!

If it's even true that you know the mayor in the first place, you can try if you like, but the mayor has exactly zero say in the hiring practices of a private business.

> How do I even know you really work here?

Well, I'm wearing a shirt with a marina staff logo and carrying a clipboard with marina paperwork. If that's not enough, you can look up the phone number for the marina office and you can call and ask them for a physical description of their dockmaster.

> What if I refuse to pay? I bet you can't even do anything. You can't touch me or my boat.

I can call the police and file a trespassing report using the name and registration number clearly displayed on your boat, with this photo I just took with my phone to prove you were here. And I can have your boat towed and stored at your expense until you pay your docking fees.

> I have a dock at Other Nearby Marina.

...good for you? So... OH, you heard marina members get to stay for free. Sorry, wrong marina. Separate businesses, no relation.

> I have a dock at your marina.

Great, so I'll just call the office and let them know you're over here. What's your dock number? ...what do you mean don't call the office? If you're with the marina I have to let them know you're over here. Oh you're not actually with the marina? Pay up.

> I just arrived this morning at 7am, you can't charge me for last night!

Well. 

Your fire pit is full of ashes and hot embers. There's an empty 24 of beer and an empty bottle of vodka. You have a tent and four camp chairs and a barbeque set up. There's a garbage bag full of dinner plates and food leftovers. 

It's currently 8:30am. You set up a campsite, drank 24 beers and a bottle of vodka, barbequed a chicken and steak dinner, had a fire, and roasted marshmallows... in an hour and a half starting at 7am?

> My boat is 25 feet long.

The cleats (tie points for ropes) are twelve feet apart from each other, and your boat takes up three cleat gaps. Also these gray paint lines on the ground here are placed five feet apart from each other specifically for the purpose of estimating boat length and your boat takes up seven-and-a-half paint spaces. Also the model number clearly printed in bold lettering on the side of the boat says it's 37 feet long. I'm going to charge you for a 37-foot-long boat.

> But you're closed this late in the season, how can you charge me?

As the dockmaster, currently on-site and on the clock, I can assure you that we are, in fact, open this late in the season.

> It's raining!

Just another medicated Monday,25,55ptdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/55ptdt/just_another_medicated_monday/,2,1475527181.0,"Been here too long. The medication helps but the craziness doesn't go away. Recently, I was forced to take a medical leave. Was out only three weeks (may be a record for the shortest medical leave at this company). Since then, every time I take a day off another responsibility or access to data is removed from me. Others I have talked to here tell me this is the ""trying to force you out routine"". Love the subtle approach of sneak attack, the nuances of the coward in charge approach to employee intimidation. 

What to do about it?? That is what puzzles me. Am I medicated enough to stick it out until I find another job? Sure hope so, because I have never been forced out of a job before so this is a whole new experience for me. Guess I will just have to think of it an experiment and try to detach emotionally from this madness.

Here are some of my favorite lines from management.

""Unfortunately, since you were out for three weeks we won't be giving you a raise this year"" (paltry as it is - even though it is left unsaid) ""and by the way we are cutting your bonus a couple of thousand this year as well"". (In other words all the long hours you put in on the project that sent you out on a medical leave in the first place doesn't count because you we out on a medical leave). Don't you love the subtle employer whack upside the head this kind of one on one interaction provides. Makes me feel like I have made such great career choices - especially the one that lead me to this job. (Was that sarcasm? That sounded like sarcasm.)

Another one I love is ""If you aren't nicer, no one is going to want to work with you"". Like there is a downside to being sarcastic and annoyed with idiots especially when they are making your job twice a hard as it has to be. My best revenge here is the business partners still want to talk to me, invite me to lunch, invite me events. This makes it obvious that someone is just mad because I was a little too loud and hurt their little feelings.

While I feel like the many years I have been here, the hard work and dedication I have given may be more a curse than a blessing at this point as my co-workers begin to treat me as a leper (no one wants to be too close when the hatchet falls) this is one battle I do not intent to loose. I may have to go, but it will be on my terms not yours.

Feels so good just to vent some of the frustration here. Keeps me hanging on.

First of all, you tell me you love me? Ummm no. You are creepy. Second of all, you pick the day to freak out when our supervisor is off?? How convenient for you. Coworker is passive aggressive and refuses to get the door and answer phones so I get nothing done. BTW, that is her main job. Fml. I'm dreading Monday because I have to deal with this crazy bitch. I'm thinking I might go above my supervisor and straight to my manager. Idk. I don't want to go to HR. That will come down on me and maybe make my life more miserable.

More stuff my coworker has done to irritate me,62,55bqiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/55bqiq/more_stuff_my_coworker_has_done_to_irritate_me/,11,1475295161.0,"[An introduction to my coworker.
](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5485jh/stuff_my_coworker_has_done_to_irritate_me/)

First off, it turns out one of the guys who we'd thought had called in sick has actually decided to quite his job and is not coming back. This Bitch has been telling people that, now that he's gone, she's going to be a supervisor.

1. He was not a supervisor, so his quitting in no way leaves a vacancy for her to fill.

2. Without him we now have a grand total of three people on our team. One of those people is our boss, and the other- hello there- will be giving birth some time in the next two months and taking maternity leave whenever that decides to happen. Who exactly does she plan to supervise? Herself??

--------------------------

She works out her finances at her desk every payday. She opens a notebook and divides up her paycheck between various bills, makes grocery lists and meal plans, that kind of thing. Which is fine, except that she spends the whole time acting morally superior to anyone whose life does *not* require extensive and precise bookkeeping in order to make ends meet. She seems to take some kind of pride in the way her family lives paycheck-to-paycheck.

Now that I'm pregnant, she's been making knowing remarks about how I, too, will soon be struggling financially. Coming in with new clothing or a haircut now gets me an admonishment that I won't be able to spend money on myself like this for much longer. 

----------------------------

She makes homophobic and transphobic comments to me, knowing that I'm bisexual, under the assumption that it won't bother me because bisexuality isn't real and one day I'll realize that. I've told her that it *does* bother me, but she does it anyway because, I suppose, I might've realized in the interim that I'm really straight and now it's okay. 

---------------------------

She's voting for Trump. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, except that she will bring this up in conversations where it's only tangentially relevant, and then, when you try to talk about what he stands for and what problems you might have with him, she says ""I don't want to discuss politics.""

We weren't discussing politics a minute ago, but then you had to go and remind me that Trump exists, didn't you?

--------------------------

If we have anyone important coming to the building we are asked to tidy up our cubicles. This Bitch will go around to the cubicles of people who are on lunch or are off or out for whatever reason, and will ""clean"" for them. The unfortunate person will then have to track her down and ask her to return their [insert random cubicle decoration here] because she'd decided it looked unprofessional. She has a dedicated plastic bin under her desk for putting other people's stuff into so that they won't embarrass the company.

She does this to me more frequently than anyone else because I sit right beside her. Every time that she does, we have a talk about *why* I have three distinct piles of paper on my desk, and how it is *not okay* for her to combine these into one pile. Doesn't matter. One pile looks tidier. 

---------------------------

Last Christmas I was making small Pinterest-style crafts as gifts for my coworkers. I had brought the supplies to work and was making them on my breaks. She moved the supplies for her little craft to the top of the pile to encourage me to finish it first.

--------------------------

Since I have so many food allergies, I don't partake in things like open boxes of donuts or pizza because there's no way for me to know, with 100% certainty, that it's safe for me to eat. This Bitch got used to seeing me refuse food, and then, one day, when management was handing out wrapped ice cream bars *with the ingredients lists printed on the side,* it blew her mind to see me take one. To the extent that she went and got other coworkers and brought them over to point out that I was eating. Then, the next time that I chose not to eat a catered lunch that I could not verify was safe for me to eat, she became distressed that I'd ""reverted"" after my ""breakthrough"" and seemed to decide that I must have an eating disorder. 

I tried to give her the analogy that a diabetic person would also be unable to eat certain things for medical reasons, and that my allergies were no different, and she responded with, ""But you're not diabetic, sweetie."" 

For the next few months, whenever she saw me eating a lollipop while I worked or any other food that I'd brought from home, she would repeat the summoning of the coworkers, only now with more over-the-top and exaggerated praise, like I was a dog she was trying to train to eat.

------------------------

In the beginning of my pregnancy I was very hungry, and she attempted to feed me. But she made this attempt by waiting until I'd left my desk, and then putting food on it with a little sticky note reading ""For my hungry pregnant woman :)""

Naturally, from the tone of the note I assumed this had been left for me by my husband, and I was a little confused why he'd brought me something which I didn't like, and why he'd been at my work in the first place. So I threw the food away. She was so upset that her completely anonymous and unsolicited gift had been rejected that she refused to speak to me for three days.",2016-10-01 07:12:41

* One of these non-sellers was a card that, when opened, played the Hamster Dance song.  No. Google it yourself if you don't know it. Fuck that song.
* When this card was found, several employees thought it was good great fun to play the Hamster Dance song at every possible opportunity for several days in a row
* GM made the mistake of becoming more and more visibly agitated by the sound of the Hamster Dance song.
* Steve was the king of pranksters.

&nbsp; Sooo one day we decided it was time to get under GM's skin. Nearly everybody with a computer put the Hamster Dance on standby.  Several people without computers made sure to have musical greeting cards handy.  It started slow, with a couple of random people playing the song when GM was near.  He didn't like it.  When he came around, anyone who was in on the gag would start the song. More and more people played it more and more often, to the point that everywhere he went he was constantly bombarded by the Hamster Dance song.  At one point, it was playing from three computers at once, just for him.  This lasted for a couple of glorious hours, until he finally got super-pissed and officially declared ""No more fucking Hamster Dance. I mean it.""  

&nbsp; So the day went on in relative silence.  GM would sometimes drive a little electric wheelbarrow thing around the warehouse (referred to as 'the clown car') and near the end of the day, he drove through the room where I work with a half dozen other people, including Steve.  Steve heard the clown car's motor as it came through the door and he fired up the Hamster Dance song at full volume.  GM came flying through at top speed on his way to wherever he was headed and didn't even slow down as he passed Steve's desk - he just said ""You're fired, Steve."" and kept rolling.  

***

But the story has a happy ending!  Steve wasn't *actually* fired, he was only joking-i-hate-you-right-now fired. And the GM finally made enough of a mess of the company that the owner hated him too and the GM ""voluntarily resigned"" from the company. ",2016-09-29 08:16:20
Coworkers opening my mail...,82,54w6ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/54w6ov/coworkers_opening_my_mail/,21,1475067479.0,"So last week was my birthday (September 23rd).  Yesterday after talking with our administrative assistant about my schedule for this week (it's September 27th when she told me this) she asks me to sit down because she has a confession to make. 

She tells me that she and our associate director (AD) opened a package last week (on my birthday) that had a cookie in it and they split it and ate it. 

She said that they thought that it was a free sample (we never get free samples of anything sent to our office, it's not that kind of business, and we are STRONGLY discouraged from accepting any types of gifts from clients). After eating it, she told me, they remembered that they didn't look at who it was addressed to and they saw that it was addressed to me. 

So instead of telling me that day when it happened (I was there all day and nobody said anything) they threw the packaging (that also contained a letter) in the trash. After she told me, I immediately fished through the garbage and found the package and learned that it was a ""surprise"" present from my wife and my name was as big as day on the front of the bag AND it clearly says ""A gift for you from [insert my wife's name]"". 

I confirmed with my wife that she did indeed send it. She said that she didn't tell me about it because it was supposed to be a surprise, but thought that it hadn't been delivered yet. 

Nobody has apologized for what they did and furthermore, when I brought it up to our administrative assistant, you could tell she was clearly embarrassed, but said, ""Tell your wife I said thanks""

Should I laugh it off as a mistake? Or am I within my rights to be genuinely pissed off about this.  It's just a cookie, but that's not the point....

**UPDATE EDIT # 1:** Thank you for the support everybody!  

About an hour and a half after I made this post, my Executive Director (ED) came in my office to talk, not about what happened (and I assumed that she didn't know about it) but about normal work business.

When she came in my office she noticed that I had the cookie packaging on my desk from yesterday.  She pointed at it and made a frowny face. 

I looked at it, looked a her and asked, ""You know about this?"" She immediately closed my office door, sat down and said that the AD told her about it yesterday and asked if our administrative assistant has said anything to me about it today.  I told her that she had still not said anything to me yet, nor did she apologize yesterday.  ""Did she make any plans for restitution?"" she asked. I told her as far as I know she had not, but it wasn't JUST about eating my food. It was about opening my mail, eating my stuff, throwing it away AND not telling me about it until the following week AND not apologizing.

My ED said that she will have a talk with both the AD and admin asst, because technically since the AD is my direct supervisor it falls within his purview to handle this situation.  And since he ate half of the cookie too he should definitely say something to her.  She that when she talks to the admin asst., she will encourage her to make some sort of restitution.  I told her all I want is a sincere apology, recognition that she fucked up and that it will never happen again. 

20 minutes later I saw her pulling the admin asst. into her office.  

I haven't heard anything since.

I'll keep you all updated. ",2016-09-28 15:57:59
The Ultimate Embarrassment Benchmark,41,54mzmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/54mzmi/the_ultimate_embarrassment_benchmark/,6,1474924743.0,"(This is about people having fun at work that could be pure drudgery. I am only a bit player, but the story is still worth it.)

Back-story: My job has me working from home. Home was fine, but [wife] and I decided if you can live anywhere, why not someplace fun?  We were able to find a waterfront place in middle-of-nowhere, Florida, with a dock and boat lift. Not expensive, since as I mentioned, it is in fact in the dead center of nowhere. 

After about four years of enjoying the fishing during the days, as an experiment [wife] and I turned on the light at the end of the dock and I tossed the bait net at about 10 PM. Up came about half a dozen large shrimp! Tossed again, same result. Virtually every throw brings up shrimp! We can’t stop, this is GREAT! Much later we realize it’s now 1 AM, we have pounds and pounds of delicious shrimp, so fresh they are kicking… but no ice to hold them till morning. I need to go buy ice.

In ""town"" (pop 2000) is an automated ice dispensary where you stick in money and a 20 pound bag of ice drops out. I’m dressed for cast-netting; a swimsuit, t-shirt, sandals. After netting for hours the shirt is much too fishy for the car, so I take off the shirt, sit on a towel so my wet shorts don’t foul the seat, and drive to the icehouse. No one will see me at 1:30 am in MiddleOfNowhere at the off-road icehouse, or care if they do.

Icehouse money-taker-machine is broken. No ice from there.

The all-night gas station / convenience store on the highway through town is open… and they sell ice! As I walk to the door I see the sign “no shirt, no shoes…” but, I HAVE to have ice!

I step inside. The counter is manned by two ladies.

“I’m sorry I’m not properly dressed, but something has come up, and I have an unexpected, sudden and desperate need for a couple of bags of ice. Can I please buy ice dressed like this, or must I go get a shirt and come back?” (Smile… thinking please please please - just sell me the ice!)

They look me over and evidently decide that it’s BORING working the wee hours in a town where no one is out at night. Play me for a little bit first.

“Hun, you can come in anytime like that! That sign is just for the nasty 'ol oystermen. Come on in, stay a while! What in the world do you need ice for at this time of night anyway?” Etc., etc. Eventually I told them the required number of jokes, they took my money and I got my ice.

One would think that was embarrassing, but that’s just because you don’t yet have the Ultimate Embarrassment Benchmark, which follows.

A couple of days later (Saturday morning) [wife] and I are driving out of town. We stop in the same store to get coffee and a couple of chicken biscuits. The place is packed, bustling, loud, and all they have left for breakfast is hot wings and corn dogs. I get coffee and get in the long line. At the counter is one of the ladies from a couple of nights ago. Harried voice: “Did-you find-everything-you-were-looking-for?”

“Well, I was hoping for two chicken biscuits, but I see you’ve had a really busy morning. Just the coffee will do, thanks.”

Sudden interest. “Hey... I don’t recognize you, but I know your voice from somewhere?”

“Ice at 1:30 in the morning.”

Face lights up, shouts to back room “HEY! IT’S OUR FUN, WET GUY... ‘CEPT NOW HE’S WEARING CLOTHES! AND HE NEEDS A COUPLE OF CHICKEN BISCUITS!”

Place falls dead silent, and I can feel every single set of eyes locking on me, speculatively.

From the back “OH, LORDY! WE”RE ALL OUT! BUT, TELL HIM TO HANG ON! I’LL PUT TOGETHER SOMETHIN, SOMEHOW!”

After an amazingly short (but eternally long) one minute, in which not a single soul in the store said a word or moved a muscle, the other lady comes out with two hot chicken biscuits. I smile, thank them both, pay and leave. At the door I glance back. Every soul is still rooted in place, watching me leave. Even the next person in line has not stepped forward yet. The only motion is the two ladies enthusiastically waving “bye-bye”.

And that is why we have to move out of state.

Stuff my coworker has done to irritate me,78,5485jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5485jh/stuff_my_coworker_has_done_to_irritate_me/,5,1474681450.0,"FIRST OF ALL: I am apparently gestating my unborn child incorrectly. 

First trimester- My morning sickness lasted all day long. This Bitch told me I could cure it by eating a very specific brand of crackers first thing in the morning. I ate the crackers, I still threw up, it's almost like morning sickness is just a thing that happens to pregnant people. This Bitch didn't believe that I'd really eaten them, because if I had then I wouldn't have morning sickness anymore. So she threatened to look my mother up on Facebook and tell her that I ""wasn't taking care of myself.""

""Don't do that. My mother doesn't know I'm pregnant yet. I'm waiting until the three month mark to tell my family. Also, she lives in another state and I'm a grown-ass woman.""

""Oh, I wouldn't tell her that you're *pregnant.* Just that you're not taking care of yourself.""

Second trimester- I started wearing baggier clothes. This Bitch lit up like a jack 'o lantern when she saw me come in in yoga pants. She happily told me that I was a mother now, that I was going to dress this way for the rest of my life, and that I'd better get used to it.

""I still have all my old clothes. I'm sure I'll wear them at some point.""

Nope, I was going to be exhausted and get fat and stop caring how I looked and I'd be too focused on my children to notice. I might *think* that I'd go back to wearing my old clothes, but a year from now I'd realize how right she'd been. Also, my boobs were gonna sag. 

Third trimester- 

This Bitch: ""Hey, remember when Other Coworker was pregnant and we raised her desk up like a podium so that she'd be more comfortable? Want us to raise your desk?""

Me: ""No, not even a little bit. My abdominal muscles feel like someone's been kicking me from the inside for the past six months. I'm perfectly happy hunching over my desk. Bad posture never felt so good.""

So, of course, I come in on Monday and my desk is roughly level with my tits.

Maintenance guy: ""This Bitch said that you *really* needed your desk raised. I don't have time to lower it today, but I can probably have it done by tomorrow.""

I spent the entire day wincing in pain, sitting ramrod-straight and still typing like a little kid who can't reach the bathroom sink. This Bitch argued with me the whole day about how much better this new height was for me. 

--------------------------

For all her opinions on how I wasn't taking care of myself during my pregnancy, This Bitch tried to poison me when I was five months. I have the ""kill you to death"" type of food allergies, specifically the ones that don't even let you stay in the kitchen when someone is cooking with those ingredients. This Bitch knows this. This Bitch also knows that we're not allowed to have food on the floor, period. And yet, This Bitch *insisted* on eating her allergen-filled snack right next to the allergic pregnant lady.

""Why does my throat itch? Wait, what are you eating?""

""Tee-hee! You don't want to know!""

""Uh, I think I already do. What the fuck?""

She told me she could eat whatever she wanted. I agree with this, but if she's gonna pick the one that murders me, maybe she can eat it in an area where I don't need to be? Where we're actually allowed to have food?

--------------------------

Before I got pregnant, there was a time when I *almost* escaped sitting next to This Bitch. She has a tendency to be loud. Loud enough that customers on the phone with me would comment on how loud she was being. I would say ""I'm sorry, my coworker is also on the phone,"" which would be a lie because more often than not she was just gossiping loudly over the side of her cube. Until one day she happened to hear me. And decided that an appropriate response would be to come into *my* cube, get her face right up against my face, and say ""hello!"" into the phone *which I was currently speaking into.* Because we work at a Chuck E Cheese and not a large insurance company.

Cue me walking up to our boss and saying ""I cannot sit next to her. I *will* not sit next to her. I'm not sitting back down. Move me somewhere else."" 

He put me in the cube around the corner, which lasted all of two weeks until the ethernet port in that cube died and it was apparently easier just to move me back to my old one.

-------------------------

At one point, This Bitch decided that she was going to do everyone else's job. Even the jobs of people in other departments which we had not been trained to do, or given the software to do, or the authority, and some of which we were explicitly not allowed to do. She would give customers instructions which sounded wrong even to my untrained, unauthoritative ears. My concerned ""Um, we're *really* supposed to transfer that,"" was met with a snarled ""Don't tell me how to handle my calls!""

Within the week our boss was up her ass about all the power she does not wield, despite how important she may think she is.

-------------------------

This Bitch shouts at anyone who tries to give her a performance review. One of the quality control guys is visibly frightened of her.

-------------------------

This Bitch is also a self-proclaimed racist. I have one of those names which indicates that my mother thought I was very special. I'm white and my heritage is about as exciting as a bowl of oatmeal, but I can see how someone who's first introduction to me is a phone call might assume there's some cultural origin to my name.

This is presumably why I got called a whole bucket of racial slurs by a particularly crotchety customer.

While I was ranting about my encounter with this delightful gentleman, This Bitch cut me off to say that I couldn't really blame him, since companies really shouldn't be hiring foreign people. 

When it became clear that I didn't quite understand what she was telling me, she justified her position with several stereotypes and the assertion that everyone needs to learn English. I proceeded to tease her for being racist. She was hurt and said that she'd thought this was a safe space.

------------------------------

We recently got some new hires who are supposed to be shadowing people as part of their training. Three of my coworkers were out sick today, leaving just me and This Bitch. This Bitch insisted that all the new hires shadow her instead of me because she's the ""senior licensed agent on the floor."" Our positions and responsibilities are 100% equal, and she got her insurance license several months *after* I did. She readily agreed that I'd finished my qualifications before she did, but that she'd ""since surpassed me and was now in charge."" Around lunchtime the new hires started deserting her, because apparently she was ignoring their questions. She's not speaking to them, or to me, because I've actually been teaching them things.

"""If I buy the wrong thing, will it still be right?""",29,547mfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/547mfj/if_i_buy_the_wrong_thing_will_it_still_be_right/,3,1474673209.0,"I am an insurance agent. I know that a lot of people don't really understand insurance, and I get that, and I try to educate our customers the best that I can, but *come on, now.*

I was on the phone for an hour today with a lady whose question basically boiled down to ""If I buy the wrong policy, will it cover me anyway?""

No. No, it will not, because what you just asked me is ""If I buy the wrong thing, will it still be right?"" By virtue of it being the wrong thing, *it will not be right.* And if you buy a policy for the wrong thing, *it will cover the wrong thing.* I get that you gave somebody money with the intent to purchase a certain product, but if you mistakenly purchased a *different* product, then you need to take that product back to the store and exchange it, not magically expect it to become the first product because that's what your intent was. 

If you *did* buy the wrong policy, this is a fixable thing. You fix it by calling and saying ""I think I may've bought the wrong policy."" Then you buy the right policy. What *doesn't* work is debating with the agent about how the wrong policy should really, actually cover you anyway. That's like accidentally buying a banana when you wanted to a pineapple, and then *trying to convince the banana that it's a pineapple* instead of returning it to the store. And then trying to convince your doctor that your vitamin C levels have gone up because of all the pineapples that you've been eating. And then screaming at the grocery clerk because you bought bananas under the *expectation* that they could be pineapples, but it turns out that they'd never stopped being bananas. 

And maybe the clerk even brought this up to you at some point, but *ohhhh no,* you KNEW that it was okay that you were only buying bananas. Because they were cheaper, or easier to peel, and you were such a savvy shopper, and they'd *have* to raise your vitamin C levels because that was your intent while buying them, *even though you should've been buying pineapples, ya fuckwit.*

Reference from Weirdo Former Boss,32,545yz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/545yz6/reference_from_weirdo_former_boss/,2,1474652751.0,"I wrote the ""Working with Weirdos"" story a while ago (which is here if anyone wants to feel better about their job situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4v6zfl/working_with_weirdos_part_1/). Here's a quick update and question.

I finally got a call back from a wonderful temp agency that could get my foot in the door at our local university, which has great benefits and pay. The interview went very well and I gave him a list of solid references that would go to bat for me. Unfortunately, he made it clear that he'd need to contact my former boss (AKA: passive aggressive weirdo who may or may not smear me). 

Boss has a history of being untruthful and did NOT want me to collect unemployment. He tried to frame an e-mail I sent him as a resignation letter before they decided to fire me. He then lied to the unemployment office, saying I had been given an official printed warning (detailed in part 3 of ""Working with Weirdos"" if you like a good firing story). 

So how do I handle this? The recruiter gave me his card and encouraged me to reach out with any questions or concerns. Do I let him know that this guy is a little...unconventional? I had to explain why I left the company on my job application and phrased it in neutral terms, something like this:

""I was the only employee for a new real estate start up co-founded by a husband and wife team. Unfortunately they decided they needed someone with more experience at that stage of their development.""

I know badmouthing a former employer isn't going to do me any favors but do I have any choice but to sit around and wait for the recruiter to call this guy, presumably first?

Now what? We're both stuck,42,540ex9,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/540ex9/now_what_were_both_stuck/,2,1474568810.0,"Hey guys so I got one that happened to me just yesterday and is kind of funny.


So it was around 5:30pm and the office was empty except for me when I hear a knocking at the backdoor. I figure it's just a truck driver who wanted to sign in or something and failed to read the office hours sign. I ignore it but he keeps knocking harder and harder calling the office main line, so I figure I can tell him that the office is closed and he needs to call the control room to sign in (it's a weird system but oh well). I head to the back door and open it up to a guy covered in mud panting like he just ran a marathon.  Before I can say anything he tells me his truck (semi truck/18 wheeler/lorry) is stuck in some mud and if I could get someone to pull him out. This isn't uncommon since its been raining off and on and the plant is a landmine field of hard mud and quicksand. You never know what it will be until you hit it.  


I call the operations manager to see if he has anyone free but turns out to be in the middle of an ""emergency"" and all of my guys have long since gone home. So I decide to do it. The truck driver was trying to park his truck (we allow certain drivers to park at the plant because they are the ""main"" drivers for us) and slide into a ditch. No problem, I'll get the loader and pull him out. He has his own chain so it makes it even easier. I hop into his jeep that he drove over to the admin building and he takes me to one of the loaders. After we get there and I move the loader behind his truck, we hook the chain up to the back of his trailer than to the back of the loader and I slowly pull him out.  Good all done right? Nope


As I backed up the loader so we could unhook the chain, the ground gave way under the loader and it began to slip into the ditch. I tried all my old tricks, pushing with the bucket,  rocking back and forth, than side to side but nope she found some quicksand mud. So the driver gets the idea, hey we still have the chain connected, I'll pull you out now.  He jumps back into his truck and pulls me backwards. Only problem is he drives straight into the spot he was just stuck in. Now that I'm free I pull him free, again, and drive further back to give him room to turn.  Being as careful as I can, I back up once more to release the chain only to see that his truck is now sliding deeper into the ditch and in a panic he drives forward, pulling me with him into the ditch.


There we sat, me sitting in about a foot of mud, him stuck pretty much at the bottom of the ditch now, unable to break free. Luckly we have 2 loaders on site so after I got the first loader unstuck, we daisy chained (tied one loader to the other) the loaders and with the help of an irritated ops manager, we dragged the truck a good 1/8th of a mile out of the ditch and on to the asphalt.  He decided that he would just drive his truck home that day and my day that was suppose to end at 5 didn't end till 6:30.

Let's talk about this potential employee that walked into my office. We ran a background check on this applicant (like we always do) and it wasn't pretty. This applicant has quite the rap sheet:

* Shoplifting
* Impersonating an Officer
* Deposit Account Fraud (writing bad checks)
* Theft
* Criminal Trespassing

And all within the past decade. Obviously, we took a look at this background check, as well as the complete lack of references, and told this applicant that we would not be interested in offering them a position.

*T: Wake Up*

Huh? Oh... oh right... we do not run background checks on potential hires, let alone existing employees, and the applicant was not someone looking to be hired, it was Marsha.

Clearly, someone took a dump on an already crappy situation, and Eric just made me a Janitor hat.

**Prologue:** I am a former white-hat hacker who studied fraud investigation in college, and I got bait-and-switched from a simple bookkeeping job into a nasty situation that no amount of coursework could have prepared me for.

**The Players:**

* T: Me, probably should have taken up a career as a private investigator.
* E: Owner, Provider of either the greatest or worst opportunity I could have ever asked for... probably both.
* M: Marsha, rated ""F"" for Felon.

I probably should have led this story telling you all that I had fraud investigation and penetration testing training, but I think that would have given away the surprise! On top of the 10-15 years of colorful history with the local court system (which, of course, only covers this one court system, doesn't look at anything that might have been done in other states or counties), I also found a plethora of blog posts specifically targeting Marsha outlining the terrible ways she had impacted these people's lives.

I can't imagine how absolutely toxic someone would have to be to inspire blog posts...

Wait... I can.

At this point, I'm in full investigation mode, pulling an all-nighter (and claiming sweet, sweet time-and-a-half) looking through our systems for evidence of fraud.

The problem wasn't finding evidence, the problem was that our entire SYSTEM was evidence. No accounts added up, very few GAAP procedures were followed, and I could see about eighteen different ways that money could have been funneled out of the firm. The problem is that investigating any one of those lines is horribly time consuming, and so far the end of the line added up, it was just that we had not reconciled our accounts in two years. Eventually, my actual work caught back up with me, and I could not continue my investigation in earnest...

But the story does not quite end there.

Long sorry, tldr at bottom.

An update to this one was requested and forgive me if I am doing this wrong.


So the situation has come to an end and to understand how it went down a bit of background is required. I am a Logistics coordinator and the guys who work the pads are my guys. Meaning I'm their supervisor. I am new to the supervisor gig, having only been doing it for 2ish years The maintance manager has been with the company for about a year and a half but has something like 40 years in the industry. He is good at what he does which is dealing with the alcohol making side of everything. So good in fact, that when he put out he was looking for a new job, companies where sending him offers to try to get him. But when it comes to heavy machinery, he barely knows the basics of them. We have a well documented history of us butting heads since he constantly feels the need to tell my guys how to do their jobs which in turn ends up being worst and harder on the machines than they currently where doing it.  He knows I'm new to being a supervisor and I feel this has something to do with that.


Me will be me.

MM is the maintance manager

The kid is the guy who was driving the telehandler.

BM is the boss man over me and MM.


We had the meeting at 7am since that's when the kids shift starts and today is suppose to be my day off. I'll start off after the red tape crap which explains what the meeting is about and the goal of said meeting, which is to figure out the real cause and persons at fault. Forgive formatting again I'm on my phone having breakfast at a restaurant.


BM: So kid, tell us everything that happened before the accident.


Kid: MM came up to me around 7:30am and told me to extend the arm out and push the wetcake by driving into it so we would stop breaking the hydrolics. JackSego came around about 30 minutes later and told me to do it like we normally do and that he would see if we can pull some rails out so I could push from the side. MM came by a few minutes later and told me to do it like he said and that he would talk to JackSego. I tried to get a hold of JackSego on the radio but couldn't get a hold of him so I started doing it like MM wanted. Everything went fine till the arm snapped.


BM: Did you do anything different?


Kid: Nothing really, just the same thing I had been doing.


BM: JackSego why couldn't he get you on the radio?


Me: I had my radio turned down and forgot to turn it up when I went into the plant and didn't hear it. (since I work in the office now I don't keep my radio full blast, the plant is on average 100db at any given location, this is a common problem we have with people who work/go to the office. I know it's not an excuse but I'm human)


BM: MM where you aware that JackSego advised him not to do it the way you suggested?


MM: Yes the kid told me, but if he had been doing it exactly like I told him than nothing-


(at this point I get fed up with his bullshit)


Me: he should have never been told to do it like that to begin with. It doesn't take much to see that the arm will break like it did. Why didn't you bring this up with me? Haven't we already discussed this? Any problems you have with how something is being done on the pad you take it up with me.


MM: You know how many times I have called (the rental company) to come fix it. Why didn't you do something sooner?


Me: There isn't much that can be done. Those machines are not meant to do that (push wetcake in any manner) what do you think is going to happen?  Of course they are going to get torn up. Until we make a path we don't have any other options. If you came to me first than we could have figured out a better plan.


MM: He still wasn't doing it like I told him to, if he did, the arm wouldn't have broken.


At this point I know that this is his only argument and was expecting it to boil down to that. Over the weekend I had been in touch with our safety guy (during this whole thing he is doing contractor orientation and couldn't attend) and asked him to look into the equipment training records to see if MM had completed them. He had not for whatever reason.


Me: In all truth, you should not be the person telling people how to operate machines you yourself are not qualified to operate. I checked with (safety guy) and you never did the licensing tests. Have you even driven a telehandler like that one?


(this has been my biggest pet peeve while I worked with machines, having someone who has never driven a machine telling others how to operate it. This is dangerous and reckless. If the person can not demostrat what they are asking in a proficient manner than always get another opinion and a more skilled set of eyes to either agree or disagree with their methods)


BM:Alright guys let's settle down. MM we have discussed you bring any concerns to JackSego first and letting him a deal with it. This is his area and has a lot of experience in working the pads and the machines.  I agree with you that something needs to be done about how we handle this but we need to work as a team to solve these issues. You said he wasn't doing it like you told him, what exactly was he doing wrong?



MM: He was pushing too much at once, I told him to only use half the bucket but he must have been using the whole thing for it to break like that.


Me: Did you see him use the whole bucket? You where right next to me and we all didn't see the bucket go into the wetcake. 


BM: Would using half the bucket kept the arm from breaking?


Me: No, the wetcake piles up inside the bucket after a few feet and once it does it gets sucked down causing the arm to bow like we saw.  It would only be a matter of time before it broke. What he suggested was dangerous and unnecessary, he could have caused the kid to get seriously hurt and only shows his lack of understanding on how to operate those machines safely and since he is not even trained to use them should not be giving advice on them.  I was already taking care of the problem when he told the kid to keep doing it his way.


BM: Kid, did you tell MM that JackSego was working on it?


The kid: Yes, I told him JackSego was looking for him to remove some rails.


BM: Ok well, you can head back to work, I'll be in touch with you later.


(kid leaves)


BM: Ok so here is how I see it. MM you should have talked to JackSego before doing anything, and also since you are not licensed to operate the telehandler you are not permitted to instruct others how to do so. (this I didn't even know was a thing since everyone does it, but the policy reads 'non-licensed emploees are not permitted to operate or ASSIST in the operation of rolling stock' pretty much my company has a don't touch policy, but since everyone is trained on everything during their orientation it's not a big deal, MM wasnt). This isn't the first time you have done this so we will discuss this later. 


From this point forward BM tells MM that he is not to instruct my guys unless what they are doing is a safety risk and that he will need to undergo the training for the equipment. Than proceeds to scold us for how we acted. Fair enough I guess. I'm currently going to try to get some of the kids vacation hours back. I won't be able to get them all since any accident, regardless of fault, requires a drug test and a tempary suspension till the results are back, but I might be able to get a couple of days back at least. Other than the incident report which is mandatory the kid is not being held resonsible for what happened.

TL:DR Maintiance manager screwed himself by telling someone how to do a job he didn't know how to do. The kid is in the clear.

Rules From my Workplace,20,53cps8,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/53cps8/rules_from_my_workplace/,2,1474214122.0,"I've worked for my department for approx 5 soul sucking years now and need to vent. So, here are some rules from my workplace.

1. Staff members are not required to communicate information affecting the administrators role to her. It is the admins responsibility to eavesdrop on staff telephone conversations so she is aware of what is going on. (yes, I was actually told this by my boss. )

2. You don't need to let the administrator know when you need her to complete work by. If she asks for a timescale do not commit to an answer. Or ask when *she* thinks it should be done by. Basically, be as awkward as possible. 

3. If you need something with a tight deadline completing, ensure that you do not give the administrator all of the required resources until 45 mins before she leaves / the deadline. This way you can complain that she was unhelpful and failed to do her job. 

4. If you f*ck up majorly, don't worry about it. We'll blame it on the admin. And if we can't because she documents everything then we'll just sweep it under the rug. ",2016-09-18 18:55:22
"10% of the Time, She is Right 40% of the Time: A Marsha Tale",45,53bgzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/53bgzp/10_of_the_time_she_is_right_40_of_the_time_a/,15,1474189711.0,"**Part 1:** [I applied for a loan without an application.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/51lzb9/the_imaginary_loan_a_marsha_tale/)

**Prologue:** I'm as green as they come, and my manager has demonstrated that she has no interest in training me. Where previously I was just working my standard 9-5, 40 hour week, at this point in the story I'm averaging about 50. 

Marsha has established a clear pattern where 50% of the time she is unavailable, 25% of the time she takes the work assigned by the owner off my plate, 15% of the time she clearly and blatantly lies to me, and 10% of the time where she will actually help me. Now, let us be clear, that is 10% of the time where she will help me, but she [has approximate knowledge of many things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9_iQ1FSnp8&t=32s), and approximate knowledge does not help when you have to follow GAAP and pay attention to details.

This episode, we are going to speed through about thirty days, so you all can get a feeling for what I have to deal with.

Again, The Players:

* T: Me, In need of medication.
* E: Eric, Owner/CEO, stopped going to the hat store, integrated hat manufacturing into our business model.
* M: Marsha, Best thing to ever happen to me.

That is only half a joke. I learn best in the crucible. I learned this specific version of Quickbooks's unique functions faster and better by being told to ""figure it out"" by Eric as opposed to me taking a college course on it.

Alright, que up the Benny Hill Theme.

**How To Apply for a Customer Loan**

> M: First you have to fill out a credit application, then you have to run a background check and credit check and send that documentation to the bank, then you have to call in the application to the bank, then you have to wait 3-5 days for the approval, then if it is not approved you have to sacrifice a virgin to Baphomet, then you have to... (There's a flow chart, it's two pages long)

*T: Leave M's Office, Call Bank*

> T: Hi there, I would like to get our customer a loan.

> Bank: No problem, did you download the phone app?

> T: ......

There is an app for that, and this app not only gets you the approval within about 15-30 minutes (from opening the app to receiving the result, not just submission to approval), it can also populate all areas of the form either by scanning the barcode on the back of a driver's license, or by looking up the house you are at via your GPS.

**Dat Asset Doe**

> T: Hey E, why does our Accounts Receivable report have these negative numbers on it?

> E: Well, if a customer pays their deposit, but cancels the job after the three day recission period, we keep the money on our books as a credit for the customer to use later.

> T: Um, then it's not an asset, and should not be in this report.

*M: Enter office.*

> M: What are you guys talking about?

> T: These credits are not assets, they should be liabilities.

> M: You don't understand. They're creditted against the original invoice, so they stay in our accounts receivable.

At this point, I drop it. It's a bookkeeping issue that will need to be addressed later, and I have customers to collect from.

Net result, for non-accountants, is that instead of our income being +$1,000 and our customer's credit liability being +$1000, our income is -$1000 and our customer's credit liability is 0. This is bad, and wrong, and I had to take a sick day to recover after hearing this from, functionally, the CFO. (If I'm off on my explanation, I pray the IRS gods are merciful. I would like individual, unique comments from everybody telling me how wrong I am and how I better pray we don't get auditted. Just upvoting the one comment that outlines how I'm wrong simply will not suffice)

**I am the King of Games**

We have an account at a local appliance wholesaler. While we VERY rarely include appliances in our deals, we regularly allow customers to go to the wholesaler to buy their appliances of choice using our account to not only get a steep discount over retail, but also give a partner of ours some additional business. Basically, partner charges our account, customer pays that ammount immediately, everybody's happy.

We start receiving invoices for customers who bought appliances on our account, but we were not providing the appliances. One of the invoices is for a customer whose account I was micromanaging due to size and because she tried the excuse once that she was not prepared for a payment, and so I proceeded to call her twice a week for the remainder of her project.

> T: Eric, I received this invoice from -Appliance Store- (""A""). I am asking you to directly tell me to call A about this invoice.

> E: Well yeah, call them, but if you already know you need to call them, why do you need me to tell you to?

> T: Because I'm psychic.

> E: Ooooooookay...

I wait until I see N, the project manager who directly told me to micromanage this customer, go into M's office. N has been working at the firm longer than me and M combined, and I put him at around 3rd in command, but our command structure is kind of loose.

*T: Call A*

> T: Hey A, slight problem over here. I have an invoice in my system for customer X, can you look it up and tell me if it has been paid?

> A: Sure, can you give me the invoice number?

> *Internal T: There it is.*

> T: One second, let me go grab the paper invoice from M.

*T: Walk to M's office, say hi to N, quickly go to vendor file to pull invoice*

> M: What are you doing?

> T: Pulling the invoice for customer X from A.

> M: Why?

> T: E told me to get this resolved ASAP since we'd have to invoice the custo...

> M: Transfer A to me.

> T: What?

> M: You're not doing that. I will tell you what does and does not fall inside your scope of work. Transfer A to me.

> T: Ok, boss.

> *Internal T: You just activated my trap card.*

*T: Enter own office, transfer A.*

*N: Enter T's office*

> N: Did that just happen?

> T: Did what just happen?

> N: Did M just tell you that what she tells you to do is more important than what E tells you to do?

> T: Yeah, wasn't the first time, won't be the last.

> N: I'm going to go talk to E.

Some subreddits like /r/talesfromtechsupport have rules about having multiple mini-stories in one big story. These stories are all related because they demonstrate that M lies (poorly) to maintain control, doesn't quite understand the details of accounting, and will directly take away assignments from me that were assigned by E.

M caught a pretty severe tongue-lashing from E as a result. The yelling between them had become so regular that when E asked me to look into a Hi-Fi setup for us to play music in the showroom, I responded that the music of their shouting matches was plenty.

Overall, things are reasonable at this point. Yeah, M still makes some assignments take twice to three times as long to complete, but I'm getting work done and things are smooth..................

Then I decided to google Marsha.

Yeah thats not buffing out,54,537g7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/537g7g/yeah_thats_not_buffing_out/,4,1474122871.0,"So I have another tale of heavy machinery mishaps but unlike the other 2 I posted the other day, this one will be more light hearted.

It happened damn near 9 years ago back when I would help my uncle out on his farm.  It was around october so as you can imagine things are going full steam ahead. My uncles storage bins where full and we started a grain pile so we didn't have to stop the harvest.  The pile was a pretty good size (corn) topping in at about 400k bushels and since the weather was taking a turn for the worst we had to focus on getting all that corn out of there asap.  I am normaly the one who ran his front end loader, a big old girl that could load a truck in 3 buckets, but on this day my uncle wanted my help fixing a few things so we got his other nephew (a cocky little 18 yr) to run the loader since the trucks do not like to be kept waiting.  He pulls up in his camaro and parks opposite the side the trucks are going to be loaded on. So to paint a picture for you guys/gals, you have a wall of corn infront of you, trucks to the left of you and his car on the right of you with the front of the car pointed towards the corn pile and the loader is sitting in the middle of all this scooping and dumping.  I go and meet the little bastard and explain to him what needs to be done, some dos and dont's, and explain to him to go slow.  It had rained a bit the night before so the ground was slicker than hell and it would get worst before it got better.  Mainly I didn't want him doing any damage to the trailers since that would come out of our pocket.  

I stay and watch him a bit, giving pointers here and there as he gets the hang of it.  He isn't the fastest guy in the world but he had the trucks moving so I jumped into the old truck and headed off to go help my uncle.  It took about 20 minutes to get to where I needed and right around the time I pulled up to the shop, one of the truck drivers lights up the radio.

""JackSego, you better be getting back here. This numb nuts in the loader ran over his car."" 

Now you can imagine my shock when I heard this.  I get on the radio and try to reach the kid but he won't answer. I wave my uncle over, let him know what went down and we head back to the corn pile.  We get there and see the lights of the loader shining through the trucks and pull up to a circus.  All of the drivers where out of their trucks, some of the older guys gathered in a group just pointing and laughing. The younger ones all surronding the loader and car and it wasnt clear just what happened till we started making our way over.  

You know those forensic shows where they put the clues together and they solve a crime using science? Well when it comes to reading tire tracks, I happen to know a thing or too and can paint a picture of how someone was driving just from looking at the tire tracks, so let me tell you what I saw.  Leading up to the pile was 2 solid, none tread bearing tire marks. This tells me the kid was flooring it and spinning the tires, thats an easy one. Next coming back from the pile, it goes from 2 solid none treaded tire marks into 2 tire marks with grooves cut into it and a solid tire ""foot print"" at the end. This means he floored it going in reverse, slammed on the brakes and slide (about a good 10yrds) than stopped.  Leading up to the trucks it was normal tire marks so at least the idiot was being careful when approaching the them. The real problem came when he went to reverse though.  He floored it, tried to stop but couldn't and slammed a IIRC 60,000lbs loader into the side of his car.

We walked up to the car-loader combo and see his little baby stuck under the loader a good 3ft, with the corner of the loaders bumber stuck on the A pillar (the beam that seperates your windshield from your door).  Not going to lie, I laughed for a bit as did my uncle. The kid didn't take to kindly to that but honestly there was nothing else for us to do.  He told us the loader just started sliding even when he was driving slow.  The tire marks as well as the 9 some odd drivers said otherwise.  We got the chain out from the truck. Tied one end to his car the other end to the truck. Drove the loader one way, the truck the opposite way and presto the kid was now the proud owner of the worlds 1st half convertible camaro.

The kid did finish off the day incident free but never again came to help.  We still poke fun of him to this day.

I proof read the best I could but well if I don't know how to spell it to begin with than reading over it won't do much good either.

Who knew steel could snap in half,29,534avb,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/534avb/who_knew_steel_could_snap_in_half/,8,1474062259.0,"Here is another mishap that happened just last week and it ended up costing over $130k in damages.

Here at the ethanol plant we have 2 huge pits (roughly 50yds x 25yds and 6yds at its deepest) that we us to store wetcake, which is a byproduct of the ethanol process and is just the solid corn after its been fermented. It is used as fed for cattle and we have a lot of it. So much in fact that the ramp that is used to drive the front-end loaders into said pad is covered with this stuff. If we don't work our way into the pad the trucks will end up not getting loaded because the free flowing stuff can only go so far before it stops falling on to the loading belts. To do this, we use a telehandler which is [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=telehandler&client=ms-android-verizon&prmd=ivsn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWvp643pTPAhVFcz4KHUxmCaoQ_AUIBygB&biw=360&bih=518#imgrc=9ya2aLmt2C8hzM%3A) only this is the model we have to rent because the tiny one the plant owns is too weak and small.  Now these machines are not meant to be pushing several thousand pounds of wetcake with its boom arm. This detroys the hydrolics and causes a great number of headaches if not done correctly.  Since I no longer work the pads and it's a fresh batch of newbies working them, they have been tearing that poor thing apart, forcing us to call the service guy a lot (13 times in 3 weeks) and it's not cheap. The newish maintance manager is(MM) is fed up with it since it comes out of his budget and suggest a new way to do it.

His plan is to just have them extend the arm out (it goes to 30ft) and just drive in there using the engine and transmission to push this stuff till it can't drive any further up than rinse and repeat. You see where this is going right? Now I hear of this half baked idea and immediately try to put a stop to this. The MM is a stubborn fool. He will not listen to anyone because he ""forgot more than you will ever know"" and spends the next hour arguing with both me and our boss. So to settle the argument we walk to the pads and watch as the kid in the telehandler is doing as he was told. Every time he drives the telehandler into the wetcake, arm fully extended, burying the bucket into the wetcake to help push it further into the pad and into the loading belts, the arm is bowing. I look over to the MM and tell him again, what will happen if they keep it up. Well I don't know if it was because the kid saw us watching him, or he was just overly eager but on his next push, he guns it. The bucket on the end of the arm hits the wetcake and the arm bows hard. Than keeps going. Than with the nastiest metalic snap I have heard, the arm breaks in 2. It has so much force behind it that the telehandler lifted its front tires off the ground a good 3 feet.  

Now we have about 15ft of arm sinking into the 180 degree (F) wetcake, a kid who wish he wore his brown pants, gallons of hydrolic fluid spraying out of the hoses that got ripped out and one MM who was wide eyed, dropped jaw speechless. After a moment to collect his wits he turned to us and said this line.

""Steel ain't suppose to snap like that""

In total
$128k for the machine
$1200 for the crane
$3000 for the service call and pick up

The worst part though and this really kills me, MM pinned it all on the kid who is now suspened till further notice. I'm trying to fix this because he was only doing what he was told to do by a dumbass.

Post writing: just to be clear I went and stopped the kid 1st but MM went and made him keeping doing it the way he wanted not but 10 minutes after I stopped it. Which is when we started arguing.",2016-09-17 00:44:19
Forehead meet windshield..Oh hi again,47,5336sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5336sl/forehead_meet_windshieldoh_hi_again/,7,1474048613.0,"Background,

Story starts in paragraph 2.

I am an equipment operator by heart, I have over a decades worth of experience under my belt and I take pride in my ability to operate a number of industrial vehicles and equipment types safetly, correctly and to their absolute limit of the need calls for it.  At the time this story takes place (3 years-ish ago) I was the main front-end loader operator at the ethanol plant I work at now. Given my experience in those machines I was hands down the best the company had and still has, havn't gotten soft sinced I moved up, and they knew it. By policy, the safety guy is the one who is tasked in training people on how to operate the equipment but he knew little to nothing about them and had passed the job on to me. I didn't mind, watching new people try to drive that stuff is funny as hell.  Well he ended up getting replaced by another safety guy for some reason and told him of the arrangement we had going. The guy acknowledged it and took full control. Enter new hires.

The new safety guy was doing his usual walk around the plant with the new hires and it was time to train them on the rolling stock (front-end loaders, skid steers, telehandlers ect.) and I went over like I normally use to so I could take over.  The 1st thing he was going to teach was the front-end loader.  He sees me walking up and says he has it all under control and was an old pro. I'm not one to judge books by their covers but when this pencil pusher took 5 minutes to find the fuel cap and another 5 just trying to start it, I knew that in the interest of safety I better take over.  I walk back up to him and pull him aside. Now other than 3 other guys, I'm one of the most senior employees here and I use my, ""your fucking up voice"" to get him to listen.  We move away from the new hires so he doesn't get embarrassed and I start to tell him that having an inexperienced driver teach people how to operate a 28,000lb machine could result in someone getting killed, he scuffs at me and throws the policy in my face.  I have a short fuse so I just walk off to keep from esculating and notify the supervisor of the situation.  We both stand a ways back, gathering the rest of the new hires near us to keep them safe and watch as he jumps into the driver seat with the new hire crammed in next to him. He starts the machine up and heads for a vacant dirt lot that is down a pretty steep hill.  Now if you don't know much about loaders, they don't have suspension. Just big ol bouncy tires that can get out of hand real quick if it's rough enough. Well just before the hill you have to turn off the road which has a good 5 inch drop off.  The safety guy, with out even touching the brake, takes this dip going about 15mph. They both lurch forward but since the new hire couldn't buckle in he head butted the windshield. 

You think it's over. Oh no. Remember the bouncy tires? Well in a panic the safety guy slams on the brakes and causes the new hire to face plant the windshield again, than again. Have you ever tried brining 28,000lbs to a stop on a hill while going down it? Doesn't work to well. So the loader starts hopping a bit all the while causing this poor guy to smack his face into the windshield over and over again. By the time it stopped the windshield was shattered, the new hire had 2 skull fractures and a serious concussion. To top it off the safety guy was fired and the policy was changed to include ""or most senior equipment operator"".

The next new safety guy actually had someone cover my job for a week so I could teach him everything I knew about the equipment and even had me make tests up for him to take. That new hire never came back.

TL:DR Want to be know-it-all safety guy destroys a new hires face because he is too cocky to admit when he is out of his depth.

Edit: spacing and stuff


I have a whole novel of stories about people causing chaos in these machines, ranging from millions of dollars in damage, to fires, to someone destroying their own car with a front-end loader. If you want more let me know.

A Null Existence,40,52w57g,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/52w57g/a_null_existence/,4,1473946267.0,"Some time ago, I was assigned the task of responding, in my boss’s stead, to an email that had sat withering in his inbox for weeks. More precisely, the message was a recent one whose sender was following up on something sent weeks earlier, asking for my boss’s attention to the matter at hand. So it was that I was called in to save the day…something, something, fate of the free world. Obviously.

The task turned out to have to do with a concept known as ‘Business Continuity Planning’ (BCP). The basic idea is this: if the building were to be overrun with locusts, or Pokemon Goers, or some other scourge of the earth causing an interruption to business activities, how fucked would the company be? In particular, what is the dollar value of the portion of fuckedness that our department, specifically, would contribute to the overall fuckedness of the company in the event of some kind of shutdown? (Aside: BCP sometimes includes drafting a communication plan to be enacted in the event of such a shutdown and testing the phone/SMS/MySpace tree to be employed at that time. I remember this from earlier in my career, when part of this task involved my boss phoning me after hours to ensure that she had the ability to reach me at home, as I frantically scrambled to put on pants before answering the phone. I’m no expert, but in my estimation, it’s weird as hell to talk to your boss with your genitals exposed.)

Anyway, the task of quantifying the financial impact to the company of a shutdown to our department took the form of a questionnaire, asking things like “quantify the loss of sales that a one-week interruption to your department’s activities would cause”, or “quantify the damage to the company’s reputation/brand…”, etc.

As luck would have it, all I was actually being asked to do was ‘update’ the questionnaire that our department had submitted the previous year, because here in corporate paradise, we only ever do things as efficiently as possible (duh). Now in this case, the word “update” actually meant “review”, and the word “review” turned out to mean “read this 5-page document, do nothing with it, then jump out a window because your life is literally worthless”.

That’s right – question after question, page after page, the quantifiable value of my department’s activities (my pride! my joy! my reason for being!) stared me in the face: zero. And quite rightly, I might add. Fines or penalties incurred? Zero. Losses resulting from delays? Zero. Losses resulting from breach of contract? Zero.

My task was to sign off on a document explicitly stating that my entire department could meet its demise in a freak gasoline-fight accident and the company wouldn’t suffer so much as the equivalent of a spilled glass of kool-aid (still just pennies per existential crisis!).

But of course, I’m just kidding. I wasn’t authorized to sign off on the document myself! (How could you be so gullible? lol) That honor could only belong, by policy, to my boss. So I printed the document and put it on his desk with a sticky note encouraging him to “sign here :)”, because he could rest easy: I had verified – and would stake my professional reputation on the fact – that everything was as it should be.

EDIT: I'm new here so I don't know the rules, but I imagine self-promotion is a no-no. The above is original content (in that I wrote it), but does also appear on a blog that I recently started as an outlet for this sort of thing.

Later, I was doing some work near Formermanager's cubicle and the thing I was doing made some noise at the same moment as he started talking. 

>well iamonlyoneman, you just got thrown under the bus.

&nbsp; I pretended to not have heard anything but my name because of the noise I was making and asked him to repeat himself.  The thrown under the bus comment was omitted. He started asking about a certain lot of widgets I had worked on, and asked why they had all been worked on a certain way.  I told him they hadn't been worked on that way.  This apparently conflicted with what he had heard, and cognitive dissonance swept over his face for a moment.

&nbsp; This lot also needed to have records kept on them a certain way (by me) to keep track so we could pay a supplier.  He was searching for the records in a way that would never (could never) show they had been entered properly into the computer system.  When I got back to my computer, I sent him a link to our database where he could look them up and see the records had been properly kept.  He *edited* the link and (surprise!) it failed to work for him.  I tried to politely drop a hint, telling him the link I had sent pulled up a page of results when I had tested it.

&nbsp; Zero was said to me about this lot of widgets after that.  ",2016-09-14 21:14:34
"A Tale of, Like, 500 Thieves",40,52mqs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/52mqs8/a_tale_of_like_500_thieves/,15,1473798904.0,"Before my time as a pharmacy tech, I worked in the stock department of a grocery store. Retail...retail is awful. Work in retail for at least 6 months, then get out and never look back. It'll give you a brand-new appreciation of life and all the people who do the behind-the-scenes work.

&nbsp;

**STORE DEPARTMENTS, IN ORDER OF PRODUCTIVITY:**

**Meat**: Get, in, get the job done, get out. Staffed exclusively with burly, no-nonsense, bearded men able to talk for hours on the finer points of lobster sushi or the best way to cook a T-bone steak.

**Deli**: A crew of misfits. Crosseyed Bob, Fireman Sandwich Chuck, ""I can't see over the counter"" Dorothy, and others. Steady workers, tendency towards anxiety attacks when the rushes hit.

**Stock**: The underdogs - perhaps with good reason, as most turned out to be lying thieves. Home department of yours truly, who contrived to make my absence apparent whenever it seemed that theft might be on the horizon.

**Dairy**: Eternally busy, never got any work done. The milk was always well-stocked, though.

**Produce**: True scumbags. Staffed entirely by employees kicked out of or otherwise deemed unfit for other departments.

My previous stories:

* [A collection of ladies](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/4zoz4v/a_collection_of_ladies/)

* [The time the police were called](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/4z82xk/the_time_the_police_were_called/)

*****

For some reason, theft appears to be particularly rampant in the grocery-store business. My personal belief is that the reasons for this boil down into three main factors:

* **Lack of investment**. Unless you aim for a management or ownership track, it's difficult to make a career in the grocery-store industry. Hence, the people hired are typically those without careers, whether inexperienced college students or people between more substantial jobs. This also results in a high turnover, meaning that the people working in the store don't have much of an investment in the company.

* **Low pay**. Stocking shelves, for the most part, is a task that requires little skill or training to perform adequately. Management is not about to pay top dollar for ""unskilled labor"", and has little incentive to raise pay much above minimum wage, especially in areas where there's no shortage of people looking for jobs.

* **Easy pickings**. If you can dispose of the evidence immediately (by eating it), the barrier to theft is all but removed. It's the work of a moment to grab a handful of something and pop it in your mouth. I've personally seen people do this literally behind a manager's back or while they were in the same room but looking the other way.

These three factors combined tend to provide people with a lot more incentive to grab something small without paying for it than there might be in other industries. Obviously, my points above are not one-size-fits-all, but rather based on my personal experience. The grocery store I worked at hosted more than its fair share of theft, and I saw a lot of it in the stock room.

&nbsp;

#Meat

Nobody ever stole in this department. Each and every employee was a salaried professional who took their job seriously. The most that ever happened was when a customer ordered grilled shrimp 10 minutes before closing, then left the store and never came back. Rather than waste the food by throwing it out, the meat guy gave it to Stock to divvy up and consume.

&nbsp;

#Deli

The few perks of working at the store were housed in Deli. Deli employees would create sandwiches upon request, which other employees could then purchase at reduced cost. This led to all sorts of interesting experimental favorites, including but not limited to:

* *The Fireman*: Habanero cheese, jalapeño, black-pepper turkey, Buffalo chicken, chipotle sauce

* *The BJ*: London broil, pepper jack, honey ham, Provolone, ketchup, and mustard

* *The Melt*: Pulled pork, sharp Cheddar, mayo; toasted in oven until cheese melted

The second perk was only available occasionally, and then only near closing time. A cookie jar was kept off to the side so that exasperated parents could give their little brats an unnecessary reward to temporarily quell their screaming. Every morning it was refilled with fresh product, and an hour or so before closing they would start giving out the remainder to employees. The evil sons of goats in Produce would wait until exactly one hour before closing, then go clean out the jar.

Deli employees would post a guard to their walk-in refrigerator and eat a drumstick or two inside or give themselves samples of the meats and cheeses - sometimes they would sample 2 or 3 meats and cheeses at once along with a small sample of bread...

&nbsp;

#Stock

The back room that housed the Stock department had no cameras. None whatsoever. This astonishing lack of foresight must have cost the company hundreds of dollars per week, because by and large the Stock employees were lazy, thieving sneaks. In my first few months at the store, no less than 5 people were fired from Stock alone for stealing products, notably:

* *Condom Guy*, who walked out into the aisles in full view of the store cameras, grabbed a pack of condoms, put them in his pocket, then walked back into the Stock room.

* *Skittles Guy*, who denied stealing anything but was betrayed by the rattling noise he made when he walked away - caused by the **3 open packs** of unpaid-for Skittles in his pockets.

* *Lunch Guy*, who took his discounted sandwich from the deli, grabbed a bag of chips from the front registers, set them on a shelf in the middle of Aisle 5, and started eating his lunch. The store manager confronted him, then called his bluff by dragging him to the front and asked every single cashier who'd been on duty for the past 4 hours if they'd rung him up. Upon receiving a truthful ""no"" from each cashier, Lunch Guy was sacked on the spot, but rehired a year later on the good word of his sister, a cashier.

Some additional figures who still live on in legend and myth as they were never caught:

* *Phantom Guy*, who occasionally compiled a pallet of assorted foodstuffs in the Stock room throughout the day, clocked out at the end of his shift, then drove his pickup to the back dock and loaded it up before driving away.

* *Night Crew*, who were locked in at night and had free run of the store for an entire 8-hour shift. They used that time to, apparently, break down pallets, leave muddy footprints on top of the customer service counter, and leave the wrappers of their stolen snack food on the shelves.

&nbsp;

#Dairy

Each member of Dairy had at least one small container of chocolate milk, orange juice, or other stolen beverage chilling in their walk-in at all times. Their cartons of milk and ice cream provided convenient places to rest their weary bones from the toils of the day as they sipped on an ice-cold drink of their choice. One guy in particular liked to make chocolate milk using his own personal recipe: one swig of milk held in mouth, with chocolate syrup added to taste before swallowing.

A favorite pastime of the Dairy department was to open cans of biscuits and toss the lumps of raw dough at the ceiling hard enough to make them stick. Over time, they would congeal, then petrify. A few times a year, the manager would send up a crew on a high ladder to take a chisel - yes, an actual chisel - and a HAMMER to break the fossilized biscuits off the ceiling.

All members of Dairy were virtually untouchable as their manager was fiercely loyal to them and would fight tooth and nail against anyone daring to profane the name of Dairy.

&nbsp;

#Produce

A more corrupt den of layabouts, morons, and generally awful people was not to be found for miles around. The fiendish Produce employees conspired together to do one thing, and one thing only: **avoid work**. Produce was restocked exactly twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening. There was no work to be done in the back room, for all of Produce's sellable goods were shipped in boxes whose final resting place was directly on top of the Produce displays. Once the shifty ProduGuys completed this onerous and difficult task, they were free to sit down in the back and get back to what really mattered - catching up on their sleep.

I cannot count the number of times I walked into the Produce room for one reason or another and woke a sleeping ProduGuy. A few of the more industrious ones brought books to read, and one enterprising fellow actually brought a pillow.

Out on the Produce dock was the soda truck, filled with all sorts of deliciously sweet beverages. When the ProduGuys were thirsty, they would walk into the truck - out of view of the sole camera on that dock - crack open a soda can or bottle, take a swig, then walk back out and abandon the container to be discovered later. The brave ones would grab a 6-pack and take it over to Dairy to cool off in the walk-in before consumption.

&nbsp;

*****

I did my best to stay away from all of this madness and to make it clear that I was not a participant in any of it. I was content to buy items before consuming them and to refrain from consuming items I had not bought. As a result, 5 months after I started I was the second-most senior member of the Stock department.",2016-09-13 23:35:04

Being a seventeen-ish female I was sadly (and of course) used to slimey old men trying to flirt. 
Most of the time it proceeded fine just giving the customers enough attention for them to purchase their tickets and walk away. 

There were several entrances to the race track. The ones next to the day parking spot were okay working at since people acted sober. But there was one entrance next to a camping area. The people who stayed there were sort of drunk all the time. 

Anyway. One race track festival I was working in that particular camping entrance. It was a hot, sweaty day with a lot of naked torsos walking around keeping up the good work drinking beer instead of water. (I actually met one of them who mixed beer with yoghurt.)

From far I saw two men, about 55 years old.
Since it was so many years ago I don´t remember how the conversation went, but one of the men (who could have been my father if I was less fortunate) clearly tried to flirt with me. 
He was kinda bushy looking with long grey hair, a leather west over his otherwise naked upper body, and a worn out cowboy hat covering what I guess was a bald patch (reminder; this is not america...). 
The friend looked really embarrased and tried to cut to the case and buy the tickets they were there for, but the cowboy dude just kept on flirting.

I didn´t respond to the ""cowboy"" flirting for obvious reasons, I just laughed nervously and looked everywhere but into his eyes.
After what felt like ages the two men walked away a few metres and started to whisper to each other. 
I was just standing there with a stiff smile, being a seventeen year old and all that.
They came back. The man with the cowboy hat walked up to the counter as the other one stood behind even more embarrased.
Cowboy dude picked up a piece of fabric from the inside of his west and gave it to me. It was wet and dirty from his chest sweat.

Then he said: I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden.

My response: What?

He repeated himself.

I just stared. A bit frightened.

At that point I guess it finally appeared to him I wasn´t interessed and that the whole situation was just.. nope. He excused himself and limped away towards the camping area, sad looking and without the tickets.",2016-09-12 20:52:41

The Imaginary Loan: A Marsha Tale,66,51lzb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/51lzb9/the_imaginary_loan_a_marsha_tale/,6,1473264093.0,"**Prologue:** I am formerly IT, currently an accountant/administrative assistant/IT/gopher/any other hat the owner can give me. Names and exact numbers have been changed to protect the guilty.

Our story begins with a lad only a month and a half into his career in a new firm with a new set of managers and zero idea of what he's signed up for.

The Players:

* T: Me, Our Hero, Wearer of Many Hats
* E: Eric, Owner, CEO, Frequents the Hat Store to get me more
* M: Marsha, Manager, Destroyer of Hopes and Dreams

In this job, we work on large projects that sometimes require a loan. One of my preliminary responsibilities was completing and processing the paperwork for these loans.

On one project, I notice that the total due for the project is $25,750, but the credit limit on the loan is only $25,000. If the increase was sizable (about 10%+ of the original credit limit), the bank would have to re-run the credit application and we would need to have more forms signed to get the limit increased to cover the project. In this case, we're well under that amount, so I call up the bank and ask them to raise the limit to cover that additional $750.

The next day, Marsha pulls me into her office as I'm leaving for the day.

> M: T, did you call the bank to try to raise the credit limit on this customer?

> T: Yes ma'am, it was under the amount where more paperwork would be needed, and I did not want to run more paperwork than was necessary.

> M: Well, T, you didn't get a credit limit increase, you applied for a whole new loan.

This is a serious problem. That loan application will show up on the customer's credit history, and if the bank approves the loan then it would completely jack-up the customer's debt to equity ratio and destroy their credit score completely. I done fucked up.

> M: Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. In the future, if you need to do a credit limit increase or make any changes to customer accounts, send it to me.

I took a liberty because I wanted to do one less piece of paperwork and ended up screwing over a customer. Her stance is totally reasonable, and I leave for the day. Immediately upon getting in my car, I call the owner.

> T: Hey, E, it's T. I wanted to let you know that I screwed up...

See, if there's anything I have learned over my life, cover-your-ass (CYA) works two ways, either it isn't your fault and you've documented your innocence completely, or it is your fault and you document that you did everything in your power to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. So I called up the man who signs my paycheck and told him the whole story.

> E: I understand. Give me the bank information, I'll get the full story and make sure everything is straightened out.

I don't sleep well that night.

Next morning, E pulls me into his office first thing, I mentally add ""update résumé"" to my to-do list.

> E: T, you applied for a credit limit increase.

> T: Right, but I messed it up, so what do I need to do to fix it?

> E: No, you don't understand. You applied for a credit limit increase. That's the only change on that customer's account since it was approved back when we started the project.

> T: Wait, what?

> E: M lied. She made up that story to scare you.

This is the first time where I had directly encountered my manager lying to me. M decided that a month and a half was too short a time for my meteoric rise from a clerk doing filing work and building excel workbooks (another story) to a clerk doing data entry and filling out paperwork, so she began a campaign of deceit and sabotage against me.

The Dickslapper [NSFW],73,500p6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/500p6u/the_dickslapper_nsfw/,3,1472409205.0,"I supervise a small manufacturing facility, with a team of two other guys (recently hired compared to me), and we work in a building complex that also rents out to a couple of other companies. There's two bathrooms that most people know about/use, so it's very common to need the stall, find it occupied, run down the hall to the second bathroom, and find that occupied too.

So the bathrooms get hella traffic, and it's not unusual to hear someone use the urinal while you're depositing offerings into the porcelain throne.

But one guy, this one guy is different and completely brazen in his disregard for whoever might be in the stall. This man is not content to idly shake his member once or twice to try and dislodge any urine that might trickle out after he's sheathed it back inside his pants.

No, this brave soul full-on slaps his dick for a good 10-15 seconds. It's a horrifying thing, sitting on the throne, trying to check twitter when you just hear slapping and this wet flopping sound that seems to go on forever.

I hadn't warned my first coworker, a gay guy. He came back to our space one day and asked me if I'd ever heard a guy slapping his dick in the bathroom. Sadly I cannot take credit for naming Dickslapper, it was the gay guy.

Now my second coworker had heard about the Dickslapper as me and my other coworker were complaining about him (""Shake it more than twice and you're playing with it!""), but didn't really buy it.

Then one day he had to use the bathroom, and while he was gone, me and the Gay Coworker both received a text.

""Oh my God, it's the Dickslapper...""

When the third guy got back, he told us that the Dickslapper had suddenly stopped when someone else had entered the bathroom- meaning that he's fine with doing it with someone trapped in the stall, but embarrassed to be caught out by someone who can identify him.

All three of us were kinda on the lookout for someone wearing polka dot socks the rest of the day.",2016-08-28 21:33:25
I forgot my PIN,28,4zsm9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4zsm9c/i_forgot_my_pin/,2,1472270739.0,"A comment on another Tale reminded me of this, and this got to be too long for a comment so here I go...

&nbsp; Formerly, there was a punch card system for the time clock at work.  This led to mistakes where people would grab a card with someone else's name on top and punch them out, then maybe notice it and punch themselves out, and some poor soul in accounting would have to sit down every two weeks and sort out the mess of cross-clocking on paper.  Also occasional ""clock me out when you leave"" shenanigans. Eventually the machine died and an electronic version went into use  Everyone is issued an RFID card with a matching PIN.  Either can be used to punch in/out, and most people punch this number in to a keypad four times a day.  

&nbsp; This had been in place for a couple of years. Literally thousands of times, I had punched this PIN into a keypad.  And one day I got the flu or some similar thing and went from feeling like halfass and being able to go to work, to feeling like complete ass and I couldn't hang out anymore, so I left.  When I got to the time clock, I couldn't punch out.  I knew there were four numbers to punch, but I couldn't remember what they were.  For the life of me I *literally couldn't even* those four numbers.  I knew the buttons had to be pressed, but there was a PEBKAC situation and the ability to push buttons was mysteriously missing.  After standing there contemplating my inability to push buttons for a minute, my addled mind logged out from be-at-work mode and into drive-home mode.  Shuffle to the car, somehow survive the drive thanks God, sleep it off.  

&nbsp; A fuzzy afternoon and night later I was back at work, raring to go, running at a solid 54% of full capacity.  I was feeling so much better that I could push the buttons on the timeclock again!  Buuuut the numbers were still missing.  Here comes a bit of genius: I still had the card.  After it was issued, I realized that 0/10 I was not going to have this 3mm thick credit card thing in my wallet so I had stuck it to the wall in my work area with double-sticky tape.  Leaving aside the potential for abuse of my time card, ^^we're ^^not ^^talking ^^about ^^that ^^right ^^now! it was a brilliant place to keep an important, imminently-lose-able item, and now it came to the rescue!  Without having to call IT buddy or HR or anyone to reset my PIN or whatever would be required, I went to my desk, found my card, swiped myself out, and 

&nbsp; was promptly laughed at by the owner of the company, who mentioned it was a bit early to be clocking out.  He got another laugh when I told him I had literally forgotten my PIN the day before and had to use the card to clock in (which I did, by swiping again) this morning. After my brain got back to full health with the rest of me, I remembered the PIN.  Now it occurs to me to hope I put that card back up on the wall.",2016-08-27 07:05:39

Remember those ""interesting characters"" I referred to in my [last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4xed1t/a_lesson_in_tickets/)? Well, this guy - we'll call him $Clyde - is right up there near the top of the list.


*****

&nbsp;

#The Exposition

$Clyde was an older gentleman who was hired soon after I came onboard as an AD admin. He was essentially brought in to be the second-shift equivalent of myself. I didn't meet him or really know he existed until months after he'd started as he typically had gone home by the time I got there. But eventually I started seeing him when I walked in, and then he started staying later...and later. After a few months, I realized that something seemed off; I would get up for more coffee at 3 or 4 AM and find him still there, tapping away at his keyboard. I thought it was odd as he'd sometimes be there for 12 hours or more - a few times he stayed all night and walked out when I did. This was especially strange to my mind as he was an hourly employee rather than salary and I couldn't imagine management approving overtime. One night I walked up and introduced myself.

The first thing I noticed about $Clyde upon entering his work space was the disarray. I've seen messy desks, but have never seen the like of his before or since. Printouts of arcane scripting language references were pinned haphazardly to the walls, while handwritten code was scrawled across pages upon pages of ripped-out notebook paper covering nearly the entire surface of his desk. Indeed, there were also several page-devoid composition notebooks scattered randomly across the area. What little horizontal space remained on both the desk and the floor was covered in candy wrappers, soda bottles, and plastic bags. The entire sight offended the senses, especially to someone such as me with OCD-like tendencies and a habit of keeping my desk as organized as humanly possible. Nevertheless, I set my coffee cup down on the desk next to his own, shook his hand, and we began to talk.

&nbsp;

#The Hygiene

A few minutes of small talk later, I picked up my coffee cup and was about about to take a sip when I realized I'd picked up his coffee by mistake. As I set his cup down to pick up my own, I noticed that the coffee inside was a slightly different color and texture than mine. That, my friends, was my first contact with The Cup.

The Cup sat on $Clyde's desk between his keyboard and monitor. At first glance, The Cup appeared to be a normal disposable coffee cup - plain, white, and made of Styrofoam, with small brown stains on the outside and on the desk surrounding. I assumed that, like most of us, $Clyde overdosed on coffee to get himself through the wee hours of the morning, but my first accidental glance inside The Cup brought tears to my eyes, bile to my throat, and instant regret to the forefront of my brain. For The Cup that I had almost sipped from was not being used as a coffee cup at all, but rather as a spittoon - a receptacle for $Clyde's chewing tobacco as it lost its flavor.

&nbsp;

Now, let me be the first to chastise myself. *""Chewing tobacco isn't nearly as bad as other possible habits!""* I hear you cry. That is correct; many other habits would have been much worse, including but not limited to:

* Moving your monitors to the floor in order to sleep on your desk
* Eating food so gluttonously and messily that when you were let go they had to throw away your keyboard, your mouse, *and* your monitor
* Using your desk phone to work at your second job as a phone sex operator
* Screaming obscenities at customers over the phone at regular intervals
* Falling asleep in your car on the way to work, driving off the side of the road, and somehow managing to **not** die...*5 times over the course of two weeks*

No, $Clyde's habit was none of the above. However, chewing tobacco is close to unheard-of in that part of the country, and this was my first exposure to the stuff. If I'd been introduced to it in a different setting, things would have been different. Unfortunately, from that point forward it was forevermore burned into my brain as a disgusting habit for a few simple reasons:

* He filled perhaps 2 cups per night on average, which, although it may not have technically constituted a misdemeanor, almost certainly should have
* $Clyde liked to pick at the Styrofoam cup and break pieces off the top, slowly whittling it down until the topmost edge was hovering just above the mass of chewed tobacco, exposing it for all to see
* While $Clyde was talking, he would constantly reach over, bring the cup to his lips, and dribble tobacco juice into it. He would often pick up my coffee cup by mistake and use it before I could say anything
* I had nearly sipped from a container of partially-digested tobacco

Needless to say, from that night on I was very, very careful to keep my own coffee cup in view and close to me at all times.

&nbsp;

#The Rockstar

$Clyde kept to himself most of the time and focused on his work to the exclusion of all else. We later became friends and sadly I think I was the only person he had really opened up to in years. His personality was...odd. He was eccentric to the extreme and often seemed a bit out of it, like he thought he might be lost but vaguely recognized the street signs and so was determined to keep going until he figured out precisely where he was. His true passion, however, was coding. He would go into a sort of trance while coding where he would lose track of time and forget to move from his desk for basic biological functions like bathroom breaks, food, and coffee. This was the cause of the late nights, the unapproved (and likely unpaid) overtime.

$Clyde and I each discovered our respective loves of programming at roughly the same time. While we were both self-taught, the similarities ended there. I started small and worked my way up to bigger and more complex things, but he had a slightly more...*cavalier* attitude. While I would sit down and figure out what exactly I needed to do before I started a big project, he liked to jump right in and get his hands dirty. Unfortunately, while he certainly had the motivation and the determination to do big things, I quickly realized that his grasp of programming basics and best practices was a tad underwhelming. I'm afraid that I must mix a metaphor here, because it is the only way to accurately convey my confusion and utter bafflement at most of his work: *his incomplete grasp of programming basics was a stumbling block being pulled out from beneath his feet*. I tried my best, but alas I was too inexperienced to shake his firm belief that the way he knew how to do it was the best way. Below are some of my fondest memories of my time working with him:

&nbsp;

> *This looks so cool!*

$Clyde liked old-school terminals. Specifically, he liked the way they *looked*; he'd never actually used one. He was also one of the rare breed who, for some reason, used Notepad to write his scripts instead of an IDE. He was *ecstatic* when I introduced him to [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), because he could now use a theme with bold, neon green Courier New on a black background with a blinking underscore for a cursor. He said it made him feel like a hacker.

&nbsp;

> *I'll just compile it!*

One of the first projects $Clyde worked on was a custom password manager. Never mind the fact that there are literally dozens of them already out there, he wanted to build his own. And then use it. With his usernames and passwords hard-coded into the program. Stored in a plaintext .ahk file on his decrypted-and-reimaged-with-a-bootleg-Windows-7-Home-Edition, I-take-this-across-the-country-when-I-travel-so-I-can-work-in-the-hotel, work-issued laptop. When I pointed out the fact that this plan was riddled with security holes big enough to drive a truck through, his solution was to compile the program, then delete the source code so nobody could steal all of his usernames and passwords.

$Clyde had never heard of a decompiler.

&nbsp;

> *Doing it the right way*

$Clyde felt that doing normal AD work was complicated and boring, so he decided to automate all his tasks. To achieve this end, he started building a **master program**. Of course, as highly-trained, professional AD admins, he and I both had full access to a fully-loaded, top-of-the-line development environment in which to test our scripts.

**HAH!**

None of the other admins had ever touched a command prompt, let alone scripted anything - so there were no provisions for dev environments and we were on our own. My solution was to request a workstation that I eventually turned into an isolated mock AD environment using ESXi. His solution, of course, was to put his scripts on client servers so he could test in production. One night, one of his batch-user-creation scripts went haywire and deleted about *half of the client's AD accounts*, forcing them to restore from the previous week's backup.

&nbsp;

> *The syntax is easier*

$Clyde and I had our differences (I liked to use IDEs, he...didn't), but perhaps one of the biggest was our disagreement about [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) vs. [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/). We both started out using AHK, but I eventually migrated to AutoIt after struggling with AHK syntax. Once I did so, I discovered the wonderful world of easy-to-find, comprehensive User Defined Functions and much more intuitive syntax. $Clyde, however, refused to even try it, insisting that he was happy with AHK and that he knew how to use it. At the time, I thought nothing of it, but in time I discovered exactly why he refused to use AutoIt - which brings me to our next quote...

&nbsp;

> *I don't see the point of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)*

The above is a direct quote from $Clyde. By this point we had both been working on our own scripts long enough to catch the attention of management, who asked us to work together on a larger, more comprehensive project. To be more specific, our manager gave the project to $Clyde, then a few weeks later surprised us both with the news that I would be helping out. This was a little-discussed head-nod from my manager to me that he needed someone trustworthy to keep an eye on $Clyde and how exactly he went about completing the project.

And boy, did that project need looking after. When I came on the scene, Clyde had a couple thousand lines of code spread across dozens of files scattered amongst a dozen folders with names like **New Project 1**, **New Project 1 New**, **New Project 1 - Copy**, **New Project - Real**, and my personal favorite, **New Project - Copy - FINAL** - which was actually the repository for the newest versions of only 5 or so files; the bulk of the latest versions of the project files were housed in **New Project 1 New**.

Apparently, $Clyde had started out coding this project in AHK, but partway in had discovered the wonders of Powershell and had just begun to rewrite the whole thing. After getting over my initial shock at his plan to create a client-side application as a compiled Powershell script, I saw this as an opportunity to introduce some actual source control, project file backups, code structure, and all-around organization.  The quote above was his reaction to my suggestion that we structure the code into custom [modules](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878324\(v=vs.85\).aspx) to increase code reusability and maintainability.

&nbsp;

#The Aftermath

I tried my damnedest, but was never able to salvage that project or change his Lone Ranger tendencies. A few months later, I accepted another offer and left. I always do my best to stay on good terms with management, so I found out a few months later that he had been unceremoniously let go after, rumor has it, An Incident involving prescription medication. To my knowledge, his scripts are still out there, squirreled away on client servers, waiting desperately for someone to run them...

Why communication is important..,37,4ylixj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4ylixj/why_communication_is_important/,3,1471643499.0,"So, mandatory position on phone so apologies for errors and also this is not my story, but my fiancé's but he doesn't do social media and told me I could post this. This is also written from his POV..

I work in a warehouse for a large transport company in the UK where we get goods from companies to hold for them until they need them transporting elsewhere. I manage two warehouses and have up to 10 deliveries each day. 

Every Thursday, the same driver delivers for his company. He is Turkish and doesn't understand much English but every time I see him, we have a mutual understanding that our relationship is good as it is and there is no need to complicate things by trying to hold conversations and getting nowhere. I've been seeing the same guy every Thursday for about 3 months and we are comfortable with how things are.

Today, as I was working he came to me and tried to speak to me and, as I was really busy, just kept saying 'yeah' or 'yes mate' which seemed to really please him so I thought nothing of it. After 25 minutes of him saying something along the lines of 'davii' (think that's what it was)and 'you good English man', he pulled out his phone and showed me a picture of his wife. After that he put his arm around my shoulder and said 'you, her, yes?' and I finally got what he was saying. He was basically trying to marry me off to his daughter. I told him no and politely said I already had a missus. And he said, in a way I can only describe as a 'teacher voice' that 'you have two now yes?' I quickly said no, one is enough for me and ran into the back room. If I hadn't realised what he was telling me, I could have been going to work tomorrow and finding him, with his daughter in a wedding dress waiting for me. 

This is why communication is a workers best friend. Poor communication could lead to surprise wedding to a woman you've never met. My fiancée did laugh and told me that this story HAD to go on reddit.

TL;DR - Turkish man with poor English wants me to marry his daughter and, with me not understanding what he was saying, spent 25 minutes telling him 'yes mate'. ",2016-08-20 00:51:39
Proper information flow is key,29,4yg953,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4yg953/proper_information_flow_is_key/,1,1471572171.0,"For the last week and a half, I've been working on revising a production record for my company. I had to do a complete overhaul of the thing. It changed so much that the track changes function in Word literally marked the entire document in red.

After getting it all formatted so that it looked nice and contained the FDA recommended documentation, my supervisor, the manufacturing VP, and my department manager reviewed it, and all of them said it was good. After that, the document was sent to Quality to get approved.

So that's it, right?

Wrong.

At 16:45, I was enjoying the end of a day well spent and fairly productive. I had finished everything I was supposed to, and everything that might have needed additional work was being reviewed by Quality. As I sat in my office chair, chatting with my supervisor about our work for the following day, I was contemplating my work out for the night. My car was in the shop, and I had approval to leave early since all my work was finished to catch the free shuttle service.

Oh what a lovely day I was having.

> ""JBH! JBH!""

> $me (*internally*): Oh sweet Jesus, no.

My department manager came to me to say that she wanted an additional section in the production record. She wanted it in there before, but didn't realize it was *already sent to QA despite her signing off on it*.

She simply said ""just add the DMSO  solubility test to it. You know how.""

Actually I didn't. I have done similar solubility tests, but before I could ask her to specify what kind of test she wanted, she wandered off.

My shuttle was coming by in about 30 minutes, and she was forcing me to figure out through her vague words what exactly she wanted. My supervisor suggested that since the solubility steps require a proportional calculation, that I work backwards from there.

That would have worked, except the steps in the production record are based on pooling multiple molecules together, and the test had to be based on individual molecules.

After determining that the test would be done with 5mg samples, I worked out from the production record concentrations for the final pooling that 2 mL of DMSO was the most optimal for the test.

As I started to insert that into the production record, she came back and asked me why I wasn't using the proper solvent for the test.

WHAT?!

She didn't even tell me what the proper solvent was, and just said DMSO.

Turns out the test is supposed to use a scaled down version of the final solvent solution in the production record. It's actually only 10% DMSO.

Do I scrambled to start working on a procedure for that, when she brings me a sheet of paper… with the freaking instructions for the entire solubility test on it.

> ""I made this a while ago. You can use it.""

I wanted to scream. She had all the information I needed, and didn't think to give it me.

Not only that, the document was typed and in the format of a typical production record instruction list.

She wanted me to simply type it up again because it was *formatted and ready to put in the Word document.*

The time was 17:05.

She couldn't be bothered to share this with me until after a) she signed off on the final version of the production record, b) I had been scrambling to determine how to write it for the last 20 minutes, c) I was about to leave for the day, d) she had been sitting on this for a week and a half, and e) Quality had left for the day, so they couldn't immediately sign off on it like she thought they would.

She then said that the quality manager told her not to worry about the test! It's separate from the actual production and simply needs to be done in either a notebook or its own form! So my work practically wasn't needed at all!

I tried not screaming at her after that, but my cooler side prevailed, and I simply cleaned up my desk, and told her I was heading home.

I ended up missing the free shuttle… and I ended up waiting 20 minutes for a bus that never showed despite three being scheduled in the time I waited… and the Uber to the train station ended up costing more than what I make in an hour.

Fuck. Me.

There were two in the class of four that I knew, as they're long term friends of mine. We'll say their names are Callie and Alex. Their final test to get their lifeguard certification was today, and one of the things you need to do for that is to complete a water rescue scenario. I was chosen to be the ""victim"" when Alex was taking her test (and Callie was helping her with the backboard) by the other girls, and I felt so bad. To put into perspective why, Alex is maybe like 5'4"", so I'm like twice her size, in terms of weight. So the other guards and I fool around, waiting for the right moment to fake my drowning, and when the time comes, I do the thing I needed to do. Now, my boss told me that the scenario for Alex would be a deep-water drowning, and to be what's called an ""active"" drowner while she's approaching, and to go ""passive"" when she reaches me. Right before I dip under the water to go passive, I whisper to Alex ""I'm sorry.""

So after that, she's dragging me to the wall. She gives my hands up to Callie so they can use the backboard to remove me from the water, because if you're passive, you're unconscious and can't remove yourself. You know how lifeguard tubes have the little strap that goes across the guard's chest? That ended up getting wedged in between my left arm and head while Callie was holding my hands so Alex could get the backboard. (For reference, when removing someone from the water via backboard, you have to have them facing the wall, then have their right hand in the left hand of the guard that's holding them while the backboard is being brought out, and vice versa.) So she had to untangle that, which took her like a minute. that doesn't sound like a lot, but you only have three minutes for the test. And then I felt terrible because they had such a hard time pulling me out of the water because I'm so heavy in comparison to them.

Pulling people of all sizes out of the water is a needed skill for all guards, but I just felt really bad, considering these were my friends and I'm so much bigger than them.",2016-08-14 21:44:58

Normally when you visit a state or national park, people assume that all the rangers fall under the same job requirements. We don't. Rangers come in different specializations, which may fall under different government divisions entirely. For instance, park naturalists may be under the conservation department while other rangers fall under police supervision. My Bosses (I have 4) and I are educators. Other groups do maintenance, police-like work, invasive species removal, lifeguards (beaches are the main draw here), public dock management, or help-desk work. 

Now, we were on our way to teaching some middle schoolers about the end of the ice age (and the related large mammals and native cultures of the time) when we got a call about a goose that had been hit by a car. This happens all the time, and the responsibility goes to whoever is closest rather than whoever is most trained. It was dead by the time we got there, so we put it in a bag and headed to the gated maintenance area to the official disposal place at the maintenance shed. 

We arrive to a guy in an SUV waiting to get out through the main gate. We don't recognize him at all, and he's not wearing any official uniform. Naturally, a conversation was in order. 

> Us: Who are you?

Him: I'm from (*UNDISCLOSBLE CITY ABOUT 1hr AWAY*), I'm just here for the weekend. 

> How did you get in here?

The rangers let me in. 

His quick, confident answers assured us that he at least wasn't making this story up on the spot, and there was a party of similar-looking people at a picnic shelter nearby. Being educators, we didn't really have any specific training for these scenarios, but everything seemed fine. He was probably let in to dump something in the same dumpster we were going to. We opened the gate, finished our business there, and went about our day. 

We come back later to put some supplies back in the maintenance shed in the compound. We were met by the Ranger 1 (official radio codename for the police-ranger in charge of the radio system), who informed us of a call they had gotten earlier from the regular police, who said they had gotten a call from homeland security, who had gotten a call from the border patrol (Bureaucracy in Action, I guess). Border Patrol had tracked an illegal alien into the park, had found his SUV, and had impounded it in our maintenance area to force him to show himself eventually. 

He did. When we let him drive it out. 

I'm not giving any information out as to where this was, as I don't really want the government being angry at me. My 2nd Boss spent all this past afternoon creating a very long email about how little communication there is between departments, how little training they were offered, and how little they could have done in that situation anyway for when Homeland Security eventually calls.

And Story #2: https://redd.it/4v719m

**STORY 3: FIRED?**

Fast forward a few weeks. Husband is singing my praises to his clients and to his colleagues but Wife is still hostile. Some days she wouldn't come in the office at all. Some days I'd get angry texts after work asking if something had been adjusted in a file. I have no access to files from home and can't help. Husband tells me that Wife has problem with the way I take messages. Wife tells me I delayed a closing on a file because I sent two e-mails instead of texting. Wife tells me that I need to tell her when people come into the office even though those people call her as they leave. I feel like I can't win.

Friday rolls around. I'm alone again but Husband is sending me tasks and I'm keeping very busy. 

Wife comes to work around 3:00 and tells me to go home and enjoy my Friday while she cleaned the office. I volunteer to stay and help but she tells me to have a great weekend and take off. 

I run some errands and get home around 4:00. I try to log in to my work e-mail to confirm an appointment and the password had been reset. Weird.

Then I get an automatic e-mail from Facebook (on my personal account) saying my admin privileges for the company page had been revoked. I text Husband. I text Wife. I call Husband. Nothing. I look on Facebook and see I've been blocked by their personal pages.

""I think I just got fired,"" I text my wife.

Nothing all day Friday. Nothing all day Saturday. I'm sick to my stomach. I can't sleep or eat. 

Sunday rolls around and I write them a letter. I make my wife proofread it and edit out anything even remotely accusatory. I say, ""I can't get ahold of either of you but I take it I'm no longer welcome at Wolf Realty based on your actions. Would you like my keys?""

Husband writes back: ""We are deeply saddened to hear about this. If this is a letter of resignation, we accept. Was that your intent? Your position at Wolf Realty has not changed whatsoever. If we were going to fire you, we would have had a meeting with you and asked for your keys.""

I tell my friend who studies law. ""Do NOT resign,"" she tells me. I comply.

I write, ""No sir, this is not a resignation letter. It is a reaction to having my work privileges revoked. It seems as if you are letting me go.""

He writes: ""You are NOT fired. We would have had a meeting with you.""

Monday morning rolls around.

""OP, take a seat. Unfortunately we need to fire you for unsatisfactory work performance. Sign here and take a moment to collect your things."" Wife is in a very good mood. 

I'm given a final check which accounts for one week of work and only one of the two weeks of vacation I was owed. I was less than a month away from cashing in both weeks to go on a trip with my wife. 


Shortly after, I get a notification from Microsoft saying my account has been compromised. I had used my Microsoft Office code on their new computer to get them up and running. It had my personal e-mail on it but Wife had tried to add herself as an alternate e-mail and change my security info. It was unbelievably satisfying to change the password and deauthorize that computer.

That was two weeks ago.

If you guys haven't tried Bai5 drinks, you should. They're a stevia tea drink with ten calories. I bought them by the box and brought them to work because they are delicious and have as much caffeine as coffee.

This husband and wife team have five kids between them, all from previous marriages. They were sweet kids and I spent a lot of time around them. One day their youngest, a girl around 12, grabs one of my Bai drinks from the fridge and starts chugging away.

""These are delicious!"" she tells her brothers. Her mom is working around the corner. I don't want to tell a 12 year old girl that she took something from me but I also don't want 5 kids thinking those are fair game if I'm special ordering boxes from Amazon on my dime. She finishes the drink. It's unclear if Wife, who was busy going through a filing cabinet, had noticed. 

They leave. I quietly text my wife and ask her opinion of the situation. She suggests sending Wife a link for the drinks. That seems passive aggressive so I suck it up and have the following weird conversation:

""Hey Wife, this is a little awkward to bring up...but one of your kids drank one of those Bais.""

""...and?"" she replies.

""...well, I brought those in. I have them with my lunch.""

I expect her to look embarrassed. She looks pissed.

""Well how much are they?"" she asks.

""Oh, it's not a big deal!"" I say. ""She probably thought you guys stocked the fridge with them.""

""Well I'll buy you a box. How much are they?"" 

""That's very nice but it's not necessary, I promise. I feel awkward even bringing it up.""

""How much is a box?!"" she asks, growing impatient. 

I tell her I don't know. I tell her it was an innocent misunderstanding and I wasn't asking to be reimbursed. I tell her I'm not accusing anyone of anything. I say sorry. I'm apologizing for her kids taking my stuff. 

She goes into Husband's office. Closes the door. They *never* close the door. After 30 minutes she comes out, goes straight into her office, and closes her door. Silent treatment from both again for the rest of the day.

The next day, more of the same. Total silence from both. At 5:28 (notice a theme?), I'm called into Husband's office. He hands me a check.

""This should make up for any personal items we've taken from you."" It's a check for $50. 

""I can't accept this, this is way too much.""

""Take it,"" he insists.

""No really, this is not an appropriate amount. I'm happy to share my stuff and would've let your daughter try one of those drinks. I just didn't think she knew they were mine. It's an honest mistake.""

""Take the damn check!"" he shouts. 

I leave it on the desk and tell him to have a nice day. 

They tried to hand me that check for weeks. I eventually wrote ""void"" on the last one and told them I wouldn't take a $50 check to reimburse me for a $2 drink. Wife never spoke to me the same.

""I don't know. They won't talk to me.""

I worked at a real estate office that we'll call Wolf Realty for the sake of this story. Wolf Realty was established by a husband and wife team a few years ago and they had just saved enough money to rent an office and hire an assistant. The job was $35,000 a year with two weeks of vacation and no benefits, but I thought it would be a good stepping stone job and give me a great opportunity to learn about the industry. 

But nothing is what it seems when you work with weirdos.

**STORY 1: THE PERFORMANCE REVIEW**

I dove into the gig head first. I asked a lot of questions, laughed at bad jokes, dressed very professionally (even though I worked in their dining room for the first two months), and constantly pushed myself. We sat across from each other 40 hours a week and I was a guest in their home. Needless to say I was on my best behavior and eager to please. 

Fast forward two months and we're finally moving into a new office. I set up the computers, I assembled and moved furniture, I cleaned the whole place, I stayed on top of my paperwork, I stayed late multiple days, and I planned the Grand Opening gala. Everyone was in high spirits and excited.

Friday rolls around. At 5:20, ten minutes before the end of my shift and the end of a long week, I'm called in for a performance review. 

He leads with, ""I like you. You're a very capable young man. But I don't think you want to be here.""

I'm stunned. He continues, ""Wife and I have noticed some negative energy from you. Perhaps you should take up meditating, reading self-help books, or prayer to help you focus. Furthermore, we're not sure about your work.""

""My work?"" I manage to get out.

""You always do the tasks we assign you and do them well. But I don't really see you pushing yourself. And that's important in this business.""

I'm a grown man fighting tears. I ask for examples. He can't cite any. 

""I'd really like to know why you both feel this way,"" I say. ""I'm very happy here. If there's anything I said or did to make you feel this way I'd like the chance to address it."" I'm wracking my brain. I had a migraine one day, did I seem grumpy? I had a fight with my wife one day, did I seem distracted? No examples.

I reluctantly tell my wife that I got a bad performance review and I'm not sure why. She encourages me to e-mail them and politely ask for clarification so I know what to improve. So I write a very nice e-mail saying I was disappointed if my job performance wasn't at the level I thought it was. I ask for specific examples of times I didn't seem interested in the business or seemed negative in any way. I mention how hard I had worked that week setting up the office and still maintaining my daily duties. I reiterate how happy I am to be in the industry and working with a family-run company.

No response. Keep in mind, real estate agents are glued to their phones and e-mails, even on weekends. 

Monday rolls around. They are both giving me the silent treatment. I try to initiate a conversation, ask them about their weekend, ask work questions...nothing from them.

At 5:28 that day, I'm called into the office. This time, I'm given a three page single-spaced document called ""Wolf Realty Culture."" He has clearly worked on it for hours. There are 18 points about what it means to be a member of the Wolf team. One point was ""we do not brag about our accomplishments."" No mention of my e-mail, no answers to my questions. I am deeply unsatisfied by this gesture but he asks me to put everything behind me. I put on a smile and agree. If only it ended there.

"""You're lucky this was found.""",61,4uyidh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4uyidh/youre_lucky_this_was_found/,5,1469674023.0,"A few years ago I was working the front desk at a gym when I encountered the nastiest customer I've had in all my years of customer service.

I was the morning receptionist, which meant I got there at 4:45 AM to get the gym ready for the day and open at 5. I was usually the only staff member working for at least an hour, maybe longer. It depends when the personal trainers had their appointments scheduled. Now the gym had a policy that the front desk was never to be left unattended, as there wasn't a gate or anything to stop people just walking in. If I wanted to go to the bathroom or anything, I had to find someone to cover the desk and scan members in.

So I had this woman who came in right at opening every morning. She'd occasionally show up at 4:55, yank on the doors, and throw her arms up at me. I of course never opened the doors until 5 on the dot. One day, after she had been in, she phoned around 6 or 6:30. I'll call her S for sunshine, since she's such a morning person.

>S: Hi, I think I forgot my iPod in one of the machines.  
>Me: Okay, do you know what machine or where in the building?  
>S: In the ladies only section.

This building is massive for a gym. It used to be a grocery store. The cardio section is right in front of the desk, so I could easily have sprinted over to get it if it were there without breaking eyesight with the desk, but the ladies only section is on the second level, up a staircase and around a corner, totally hidden from view.

>Me: I can't leave the desk unattended and go up there right now because I'm the only one working, but I promise as soon as another staff member gets in I'll send them to have a look.  
>S: You won't look now?  
>Me: I'm really sorry, but I can't leave the desk unattended, I could get in a lot of trouble for that. But someone should be in soon and I'll make sure they go look right away.  
>S: I'm *so glad* I pay *so much* for this gym membership where the staff are *so helpful*.

And she hangs up. Less than five minutes later, one of the trainers came in, and I asked her to have a look for the iPod. She found it no problem. Around 9:30 that morning, S came storming in while I was on the phone, snatched the iPod off the desk where it was sitting in front of me, and stormed back out without a word. After I got off the phone, my manager (whose desk isn't far from mine) asked me what happened so I explained the whole thing. He was a real stickler for rules and policies so he agreed I'd done the right thing.

Next morning, S came back in first thing when we opened with her attitude in full swing. She practically flung her membership card at me, and I scanned it and told her to have a good workout.

>S: Are you giving me attitude?  
>Me: No, I'm really not. I told you to have a good workout. I say that to just about everyone.  
>S (holding her iPod): You're lucky this was found. I'm sick of your attitude. You see me out there waiting every morning and you never unlock the door for me. I want to talk to your manager.  
> Me: No problem. He'll be in around 9. His name is Bossname, and his desk is right there. He'll be happy to discuss our policies with you.

I've found that openly offering people information on how to talk to the manager always takes the wind out of their sails, because they realize you've got nothing to hide. Needless to say, she never did contact him. I, however, filled him in on the way she talked to me, and he took her comment about me being lucky her iPod was found as harassment against me. She got a nice phone call from head office explaining they'd be happy to take away her membership if she didn't learn to talk to staff more nicely. She never gave me any attitude after that.

I never understood the people who show up before the gym is open with a shitty attitude. Hit the snooze button. You clearly need the sleep.",2016-07-28 05:47:03

The worst part is people would rather quit than say anything because they're scared she'll find out about it.

Every new employee we get cries or almost cried because of her on their first day. However, we're all a bunch of dedicated people, so nobody quits.

Basically what she does, is takes a normal, passive everyday comment, and turns it into an attack on her even if it has nothing to do with her. I feel that the reason she does this is because she might be racist. She never overreacts to things her black employees say. 

Examples include: me assuring her that I didn't steal from the register on my first day because I was short. She took it as an accusation towards her even though she had zero reason to think so.

Our new employee not knowing what to do on her first day. To which she said: ""what did you do at your last job? Nothing?""

Me telling her that we might need to put up a reserved sign, for a woman who wanted to have a birthday party there. She wanted to have it Sunday afternoon, which is a VERY busy time. I knew if we didn't reserve something for them, they wouldn't have anywhere to sit. She took this as a challenge against her *authoritah* and was sure to put me in my place in front of the customer. ""Excuse me, are you the manager?"". Even though it was just a suggestion. I don't need to be the manager to have a suggestion.

She demands respect but she treats everyone like she's an edgy teen with anger issues. Condescending, patronizing comments. Rolling her eyes at everyone. In fact she made a customer leave the other day because she saw her rolling her eyes at her.

Finally, one of my other managers told me today that she was collecting written statements about the GM. Honestly, I won't be happy unless she's fired. She's not going to change, she's too stubborn. She's not a good manager. It would be hard to find someone as bad as she is to people.",2016-07-15 04:32:02

Stupid People Exist,33,4rgqar,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4rgqar/stupid_people_exist/,6,1467778457.0,"So I used to work as a manager at a pizza place until I moved on to bigger and better things. This meant that I had many jobs rolled into one, including spending some time as a cashier at the front of the restaurant. Now, I have seen and heard a lot of crazy things in my day, but this story was probably the craziest.

In the early evening a couple in their forties came in and explained that they wanted to order, but they had some food credit that they would like to use. This wasn’t all that uncommon because when a complaint about a meal was filed with the call center and the customer didn’t want a remake for the food, sometimes credit was given for the restaurant’s mistake. But on this occasion they began to explain to me what happened.

“They almost didn’t give me credit for it, but we tried warming up our pizza and it caught on fire,” she said.

I stared, curious and a little concerned, “It caught on fire? What kind of pizza was it?”

“Oh, just a normal meat pizza,” she said, at that point having her phone out, showing me pictures of the charred pizza.

“It almost burned down our kitchen,” her husband chimed in, eager to share their story.

“Oh wow. I don’t know of anything in a meat pizza that would make it do that,” I said. “How did you warm it up?”

“Oh, you know. We just popped it on the box and put it in the oven.”

I stared. Did she just say she put the cardboard box in the oven?

“You warmed it up on the pizza box?”

“Well yeah. We always do. Our daughter does it too and we’ve never had a problem before.”

Wow… It’s a miracle they’re still alive with common sense like that. Cardboard is flammable, folks!

“Yeah, I would strongly suggest not doing that,” I said as I excused myself to make a call and check up on their food credit, saying a little prayer that this pizza wouldn’t be the one that finally did burn down their house.",2016-07-06 07:14:17
Worst job ... ever?,51,4qn862,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4qn862/worst_job_ever/,4,1467311628.0,"Just to put things in perspective when I am annoyed in the workday, I think back on this:

Back in the days when dinosaurs still walked the earth, my dad helped me get a summer-semester job in the steel mill where he worked. My dad was not management, just a really good worker, as had been his father in the same mill - this was just management being nice to someone who they thought was worth it. 

But there was a caution given me – the rules were that there were no ""summer jobs,"" only permanent employment, so I had to give a non-answer if anyone asked whether I was intending to quit and go back to college. 

Some of the workers in the shop I was assigned thought I really did plan to drop out and start a career in the mill. They (particularly the ones who knew my father or remembered my grandfather) wanted to encourage me to go back to school. Others suspected that I had temporary work in mind and were annoyed that I was occupying a good, high paying union job that maybe one of their buddies could have gotten as permanent work. The common consensus of both was that I should get the nastiest, hardest work that could be found.

There are plenty of such jobs in a mill. The shop I was working in fixed railroad “trucks” (wheel assemblies), the large gears in the guts of giant cranes, and similar things that were huge, heavy, and dirty.

My days started at 8am with a sledgehammer. I had been a high school wrestler and was in pretty good shape, but I was not large (5’7” and 115 pounds), and a complete stranger to a sledge. They ascertained that I had no idea they came in sizes (6 pounds being considered “average”), and gave me my very own 18lb hammer. 

Each morning they had lined up for me about 5 hours of things that needed pounding, enough to last until the 30-minute lunch break. Recall, this is in Alabama, in August, in a steel mill. 

At 1pm I started the harder, dirtier work.

The cab of a large crane in those days was sheet metal with some windows on the front and sides, unlike the mostly glass ones of today. The huge gears and pulleys were under the floor of the crane cab, and to get to them the floor of the cab was removed. The gears were coated in “gear shield”, a black grease about the consistency and color of soft tar. It had enough body to help prevent the gears from clashing and chipping, but the mechanics wanted it all cleaned off before they touched the gears. It was nasty, sticky stuff, and the tiniest bit that got on you stained your skin a deep mahogany color that was impossible to wash off.

To clean the gears you first put on a rain slicker (pants and coat) that had once been yellow, then take a generous glob of “white” (actually clear-ish) grease and slather the exposed skin on the back of your neck, ears, and your face except where protected by goggles. Heavy protective clothing covers everything else, including elbow length welder’s gloves on both hands. Meantime, the steam generator has been building pressure. This is a high-pressure tank of about 500 gallons of detergent water that is brought to a boil. You know it is ready when the pressure gauge is up and a small relief valve whistles with live steam. 

Take the steam wand (about 6 feet long) and climb in the cab, balancing on the greasy gears. The cabin is a little warm, since it’s a sheet metal box sitting in the Alabama sun at 1pm in August – maybe 130-140f. It gets a lot hotter when I open the steam valve and superheated steam and detergent water blasts out of the pressure washer wand. I now can see absolutely nothing - the vapor is too thick even to see my hands. I just spray the steam down to where I remember the nasty gears to be. Gear shield melts and flies in globs in all directions, but eventually finds its way out the bottom of the assembly. Every minute or so I shut off the steam and wait for the air to clear enough to see what remains to be done. 

After about ten minutes the steam pressure has dropped and it’s time for a break while another head of pressure builds up. Climb out, take off the slicker and go stand in a cold shower. You only get wet on the parts that don’t have the grease – the water just rolls off there. In five to ten minutes your core temp has dropped, the steam is back up, so have another go. Five or six rounds usually cleans a crane. They started me out on one-a-day, but after two weeks to acclimate and to confirm I was not going to unexpectedly pass out I was expected to do two. 

When finished, you remove the lithium grease that has kept the gear shield from getting to your skin using a rag soaked in mineral spirits. A soapy shower then takes off the mineral spirits before it irritates the skin too much. If you missed greasing a spot it will be dark brown for a week or two.

At one point I asked why not do the cranes in the morning before they got so blasted hot even without the steam; they pointed out that after doing a couple of cranes no one could be expected to swing a hammer, and both needed to get done. 

On the plus side, I was amazingly buffed when I went back to school after three months of 5 hours a day with that hammer followed by three hours of super-sauna. 

TLDR: Nasty job I once had makes all my work today seem like a picnic.

I don't believe you!,34,4q4la2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4q4la2/i_dont_believe_you/,1,1467049015.0,"I'm currently working as a janitor at hospital. My job entails cleaning the suites in one wing of the hospital after clients and employees have left for the night. 

This particular wing of the hospital is close to the maternity ward and the floors are numbered G, 1 and 2 instead of the usual 1, 2 and 3 which results in a lot of visitors ending up on the wrong floor. As a result, whenever I see someone who looks lost I'll stop whatever I'm doing and offer them assistance. One time, however, I got more than I bargained for.

I saw this older guy, who I'll call OG, wandering around on floor 2. I figured he was looking for the maternity ward which was on floor 1 so I approached him and the following conversation ensues:

Me: Excuse me sir, are you looking for the maternity ward?

OG: No, I'm looking for the [medical] seminar.

Me: I'm sorry sir, there isn't any seminars taking place on this floor. Maybe---

OG: It's in Room 209! That's means it's on floor 2!

Me: Yes sir but it must be in another wing of the hospital. There aren't any seminars going on here.

OG: Are you sure? What's back there? 

Me: Sir, there are restrooms over there and only two doctors offices in this wing and they're both closed. I'm not sure where the seminar is but you can ask the receptionist on the ground floor.

OG: *getting angry* I asked her and she said it's on this floor! 

Me: Sir, there are multiple wings in the hospital. It is probably on the second floor in another wing.

OG: Well I'm going to go in there to see if it's there. *starts walking to a doctor's office which is closed*

Me: Sir, you can't go in there! Sir! Sir, Stop!

OG: *ignores me and goes into office despite there being a sign saying ""Closed"" and no lights on*

Obviously this causes issues at times.

One time, a computer running a bunch of analytical samples froze in the middle of the run. Obvious solution was a hard reboot. After letting the current run finish (it still collected data, but we couldn't do anything about analyzing it), I went to make the tower dream sweet dreams.

My coworker came in then, and I told her what had happened.

> $me: ""…I hate you so much.""

$R *smirks like an evil pervert*

So I proceeded to smother the baby.

A few days later, the same thing happened again, and my other coworker was freaking out.

> $me: ""there's only one thing we can do: smother it like a baby.""

She looked at me like I was crazy, then asked if I got that from R. I told her yes, and she just groaned.

A few days later, it froze again, and I tell both my coworkers there that I'm going to have to smother this goddamn baby.

Turns out my manager was in the lab too…

I'm actually surprised she didn't faint because her face turned so white. We had to stop the jokes after that because she found it so inappropriate. She almost thought I was literally about to kill an infant and was about to yell at me.

I'm just glad she never heard $R say ""Shake it like a baby that won't stop crying!"" whenever we had to mix solutions in bottles.

"My worst experience as a tour guide. A tale of abandoned hotels, vampire castles, and a bladder operation.",45,4p3fe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4p3fe9/my_worst_experience_as_a_tour_guide_a_tale_of/,4,1466493980.0,"I was in the spring and summer of 2015 working as a long-range tour guide in Romania.

The great parts about this are that Romania is a stunningly beautiful country, and the tourists are mostly always open-minded eldery western Europeans who just wanted ""something different"", since Romania is not much of a tourist destination.

The bad part about this is that the roads are pure horror, you can easily end up spending 5 hours on the road for a 150 km ride. On top of that, **HORRENDOUS PLANNING**. It will get complicated, but trust me, its worth the read.

The worst part about my case in particular is just really bad planning. Here's a summary of the tour that made me quit:

We'd start off in Bucharest, do a short city tour after airport extraction and head over to the mountains to a village near Kronstadt where we'd spend a few nights so we'd have the chance to visit **Dracula's Castle** among others. Hotel was fine, food was bland but OK, spirits were still up.
The castle, however, proved to be a problem.

The idea is that the people who ran things at the castle should have received a reservation from the planning department, giving me a discount when purchasing tickets with the advance that I received from the touring company. **They never sent out the advance and I ended up spending about 2 times as much money as I should have.**

Now the company also instructed me to sell ""insurance"" on the bus. Romania's not an expensive country to visit, so the reasoning is that the tourists won't mind spending another 50€ for nothing, really. They knew very well what was going on but paid up anyhow. 
This money was supposed to be put in the bank at the first chance I got, on the company's account. **I ended up using this money for the tickets, since their lack of making a reservation made me pay full price**

The moment they didn't receive the money an hour after arriving in Kronstadt, they  kept harassing me by phone about every 2 hours about the money. I ended up calling back in the evening from my hotel room and nearly losing my cool over them interrupting my work over **their fuck-up**.

I couldn't afford the difference out of my own pocket, and even if I could, I wouldn't have paid them. 

Eventually I got them off my back threatening to just take the train home and leave a bus full of tourists with a Romanian bus driver who didn't speak a lick of English. I wouldn't have done it, but you gotta threaten sometimes I suppose.

We continued on our long road to the North of Romania; its lovely monasteries and majestic Bucovina. It was at this point I announced the name of the hotel we'd be staying at, and some tourists informed me that their programs said otherwise. I checked and noticed that about half the tourists had downloaded and printed programs that differed from mine. I called the company and asked what the deal with this was; turns out **the program was updated and I was not informed**. I called the hotel from my own program and they did indeed not include us in their planning. They were full.
I googled the name of the hotel I didn't know we'd be staying at and informed them of our arrival. **They weren't prepared either**

We arrived at the hotel, and there was a receptionist, and a cook. That's it. We were 38 tourists, a guide, and me.

I gave the list of the names, and informed the receptionist about which tourists preferred ground-floor rooms because of their age. They didn't have any. They didn't have any elevators either. The driver and I ended up dragging about half of the eldery folk's luggage upstairs.

Now one particularly vital (for her age, 80) and nasty lady (there's always one) got herself a twin room despite being alone. **Turns out the hotel was a few rooms short, so the driver and I were supposed to sleep in the shed outside, and this lady share accomodations with the hotel staff. Needless to say she was not amused. Neither was I.**

I don't think I have to explain how dinner and breakfast went with only 2 staff members.

The tour continued on to Targu Mures. This is a very, very long ride and we ended up getting massive delays because of a tourist who just had a bladder operation, resulting in him having to go peepee about every 30 minutes. Not that big of an issue but people **will** ask if they can ""stretch their legs"". NO, you can't. Get back on the damn bus. **We ended up arriving there late, so the Kulturpalota (Highly recommended, beautiful building) was closed about 10 minutes after we got there.**
However, a cleaner there asked the doorguard and he let us in anyways. Great guy, and all the tourists loved the sense of improvisation and exclusivity they got out of this situation. Perfect save.

On the way back to Bucharest we'd pass by Turda to see its citadel. I realized about 2 hours before getting there that there's no such thing as a citadel in this town, unless you count standing on your toes to peek over a yard wall to see a few stones that was once a city wall.
So, I changed plans. Turda is also the home to these amazingly renovated salt mine tunnels (another recommendation, google turda salt mines) and everyone was pleased with the alien beauty of this underground complex.
I also decided to stop by these massive Roma palaces. They are known as gypsy castles, basically huge kitschy structures to show off one's wealth. Romanians hate them, foreigners love them, so I fixed a photostop, to the amazement of the driver. ""why would anyone take a picture of this?""

The rest of the trip wasn't very eventful, but I couldn't wait to get back to Bucharest and give the planners a big piece of my mind.

They called me into the office to explain my costs, as I was about 200€ short (the bank deposit of which I used half to cover the ticket money after they didn't make proper reservations, remember?).
So we went over all the tickets and other expenditures before I could convince them that this was indeed **their fault.**

The girl from planning called a bit with the girl from Finance and they decided that I needed to pay the difference first, before they were able to give me my salary. This, I think, to cover the difference in the records so nobody would ask questions and their fuck-up would remain hidden.

After this botched holiday that was saved multiple times by my intervention, getting great reviews from the tourists despite the company trying their best to ruin it, **TEN DAYS OF IT**, I grabbed the money I was due to give them and took my salary out of it (about 200€ as well) gave them 2 very big middle fingers and yelled very loudly how amateurish this whole thing was. The yelling because they wanted to cover it up, of course. 

Needless to say I never heard from them again.

Hurt on the job,16,4p2f8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4p2f8l/hurt_on_the_job/,3,1466476725.0,"So today, I got hurt (not injured to my knowledge) because a temp was walking around pushing a pallet jack and looking at his phone, unaware that I was stepping backwards while unaware of his presence. I tripped and fell backwards, which caused me to grip harder on my pallet jack and it squeezed my leg between the two and didn't let up until I was able to realize the pain wouldn't stop until I let go, and pushed it forward. My boss, unfortunately is my best friend for 20 years prior to working for him. He asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital, but at the same time made me feel that it was really going to put him in a bind having to sit in the hospital for several hours, and he really didn't need an injury report. I agreed to ""walk it off"" and continue the shift because I didn't want to make trouble for my friend. Now that I am home, I realized it is really sore, and I hope it's not worse than I thought it is. If it is, I could be screwed out of any recourse, because I declined to go to the hospital. I'm off tomorrow, and I was probably going to call off work on Wednesday,  and take a point, but someone quit in another department, and my supervisor told me he'd push for me to get that spot because we both feel it is a better fit for me and really improve my job security and happiness. So now, I guess I'll just have to hope my leg doesn't hurt too much and can work, and hope my friend doesn't block me from advancement as he is known to do, because it is hard to keep good workers in his department. I'm posting here partially to rant, and partially to hear advice.",2016-06-21 05:38:45
Your resume is not Facebook!,58,4op980,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4op980/your_resume_is_not_facebook/,6,1466268611.0,"This happened a few days ago, and I *still* can't believe it.

I work part time as an HR assistant for a nursing home. One of my tasks is to go over resumes, print them, highlight anything I think would be of interest (previous work experience, relevant skills, education, etc) and send it to my supervisor for approval.

The place where I work cares for adults who are developmentally disabled. Some of them are physically disabled as well. They are unable to complete tasks such as bathing, eating, dressing, etc. They rely on their caregivers to assist them. We demand a certain level of respect and maturity from our staff.

Knowing all this, why would someone--*anyone!*--write this on their cover letter:

""Additionally, I absolutely love Victoria's Secret Pink and wear it regularly!""

Who does this? What thought process led this woman to believe this was a good thing to put on her cover letter? I'm completely dumbfounded. I'm used to confusing resumes (the home does not have a ""typical"" name that a nursing home would so we get a lot of people who think they're applying to a desk job at a ""regular"" company) but this is beyond the realm of confusing. This is downright bewildering.

Needless to say, she will not hear from us unless it's a rejection letter.

Case in point, I shared an idea with a peer manager in another group. That peer manager responded and cc:d my boss giving me props for the idea. My manager didn't even acknowledge receipt of that email. A couple of weeks later my manager presents the idea, damn near verbatim to our organization as if it was his alone. 

I've been able to succeed professionally despite this, but promotions are hollow (even when you are fairly compensated) if you're in a situation where you don't feel respected. I don't think I can take it anymore. ",2016-06-15 06:09:31
I need this in paper!,60,4nia8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4nia8k/i_need_this_in_paper/,4,1465590507.0,"I'm a graphic designer, and two of my coworkers are in charge of production. There's an annual project that requires a very large banner, which goes through several changes until it's done, and the re-printing ends up being quite pricey. 

This took place yesterday:

>Coworker 1: I need this printed in paper, not canvas. There will be at least 10 versions, so we really need it as cheap as possible.  
>Coworker 2: Can't be done, none of our partners work with paper so large.  
>CW1: We'll have to find a way. It has to be as cheap as possible, so paper is the best way to go, then we'll print the final version onto canvas.  
>CW2: Can't be done, it's gotta be canvas.  
>CW1: IT HAS TO BE CHEAPER THAN CANVAS, there's gotta be someone who has the paper!

This goes on literally for hours, she demands the cheaper banner and he says it can't be done. Fast forward to this morning, he found someone who had the large paper, and the banner looks great. We have a meeting where we make the necessary changes, writing all over the paper, and now I'll make the changes and have it re-printed for the next step. That's when the fun part happens:

>CW1: [Coworker 2], the paper banner looks great! See, you didn't have to be so stubborn about it!  
>CW2: Yeah, but at what cost?  
>CW1: What do you mean?  
>CW2: The guy only had german paper this size, it cost three times as much as canvas!

Fast food: Customer had no understanding what-so-ever for newbie,44,4n7afy,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4n7afy/fast_food_customer_had_no_understanding/,5,1465419140.0,"Background story: Today was my first day learning the cash register. I had been working since 0800 in the morning. It was now about 1500-1600, when the rush was the hardest. We had one person in the kitchen today, two-three at cash taking orders. The line was really long now.

A group of four people arrived together, age about 22-27. I took their order: The first person ordering was really slow, didn’t really know what to order (How can you not after standing in line for about 10 mins?) and changed the order so many times, the second person had a really bad tone and attitude and didn’t speak clearly at all. Took me a minute to figure out what she wanted.

Story:

When it was the third persons turn he went: 
> ""Is this the *'Express'* or what?"" (indicating that I am slow)

Me: 
> ""It's my first day at the cash register, sorry for the delay. What do you want to eat?"" 

him: 
> ""*Specific burger meal*"" 

Me:
> ""Okay anything else to go with that?”

him after a while: 
> ”Five chicken wings too""

I turned to a colleague of mine and asked where the chicken wings were on the menu (with many subcategories) because I couldn’t find them (had only made two of them before) and figured it’d be quicker than me just stressfully searching for them. She didn’t hear me.

He asked:
> ”Is this your first hour too?????”

Me: 
> ”No, about my fourth (it was my seventh but I didn’t know what time it was)” 

Him: 
> ”Daamn, four hours. That’s a lot of time. Four hours..and like this..”. 

By this time I had turned my head away and I tore up. My colleague pushed the wings in and patted me on the back.

Him:
> ”Yoo, you need to go for a smoke-break huuhh”

Then I proceeded to take his girlfriends order:
> ”Hello! Is this the same buy? Yes, okay, burger meal coming up”, 

tears rolling down my cheeks, she was really cool, waved him away while he was talking shit, and then my colleagues took over and the shift manager took me away to cry in the garbage room. And that was exactly what I felt like too. Garbage. 

I had done a splendid job the whole day, I was constantly smiling because I feel passionate about delivering these burgers to these people on their way somewhere exciting (burger joint at an airport) or coming home tired after a long trip, and not only was I smiling the whole day, my customers were too, and he was so insensitive?!? I thought that I was the last person to every cry, first day. I felt so pathetic. I won’t forget him. What a loser. What a stupid asshole. 

End of rant. Thank you.

**TL;DR:** Asshole made it really clear that I should have learned the whole menu in less than one whole day and delivered his damn chicken wings faster than the speed of light. When I tore up he recommended me to go take a smoke. Bite me.

The Coworker Chronicles:,53,4mexmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4mexmt/the_coworker_chronicles/,1,1464986461.0,"Greetings fellow Mindless Peons! So happy to be back here. I apologize for the absence, but CW has had some transphobic rants lately and along the days of political agony that came after that (she's thrilled Cruz pulled out of the race and is 100% certain President Trump is going to make life so much better for everyone) it just became too stressful for me to type all this up every day because frankly, I don't want to be that negative, even just for the amount of time it takes to write these.

So I'm changing up the format just a bit. TPC will now be a weekly installment, consisting of the funniest and craziest CW stuff I can get out of her, along with some observations about her daily life. I feel like this will allow me to give a better experience all around.

Now that all that boring shit is out of the way, let's get to the CW.

As I type this, she is wearing a blue satin tank top with braided straps and a ruched breast section that I seriously used to own in 2004. I wore it to my college interviews with a pinstriped suit. CW is wearing it with booty shorts and boots (because she thinks flip flops are inappropriate for the office). One strap is broken on it, so she stapled it back together at home and reinforced it here at the office. She asked for my help, making sure to tell me, ""Don't pop my waterbra!""

Most of her family drama is slowly ebbing, but her son's baby's mama has almost set fire to the house 3 times recently. ""She's just a firebug. She don't mean no harm."" The first almost-fire was when she ""was playing with a lighter on the porch"". Number two occurred when she ""dropped a match"". Number three happened when she turned the wrong eye of the stove on with a towel on it and walked outside to smoke. When she came in her kid was trying to extinguish the mini fire with the sink sprayer. She also recently increased the amount of her homeowner's insurance.

One day she was watching a video of a girl getting branded. The girl couldn't take it and jumped up, messing up the brand. I told her that 16 years ago my brother almost had to have his arm amputated because he attempted to brand himself. She then explained to me the proper forming, heating, and stamping technique, before showing me her own brand (it's a pair of tiny letters on her ass for her sons). She also showed me her giant lion ass-tattoo. When I told her now I was gonna tell her lion-ass to tell the truth, she didn't get the joke.

Her chihuahua was sick last week. It wouldn't eat, and it shit in her bed a few times. ""Ain't no telling what he got into."" But she took him to the vet, they gave him some medicine, and he got all better. She woke up the next morning to find him chewing on a bag of chex mix. ""That's how I knew he was alright. He loves chex mix."" When I told her things like that were probably what made him sick, she said ""He's a dog! They can digest anything."" Her son brought home a dog this week, too: a pit-mix that is apparently sweet as pie. Her cats won't stop attacking the poor thing, though. She blames the new pup. ""Can't blame the cats, pits are scary!""

We have squirrels in our ceiling at work, and CW is convinced she can pull a Disney Princess move and get the squirrels to follow her out the door (which might work if she actually ever left on time). She told me when she was younger that she used to keep squirrel food in her bag and when she would go to parks she would feed squirrels, and no matter what park she went to they would climb up her arms and sit in her hands, in her shirt, and on top of her head. She says she would name them all and remember them, and they remembered her. So she's named the squirrels in our ceiling Johnny, June, and Roseanne, after the Cash family. Which is pretty cute, I guess. But today I found a pile of squirrel feed outside on the porch. I think she is leaving it for them in hopes she can raise a squirrel army. 

CW is also convinced she has a ""heart flutter"", which is not the same thing as a murmur, according to her. ""My heart beats, it just has a little extra couple of beats in there."" She was complaining of chest pain the other day. ""Maybe if I go smoke a cigarette it'll ease off.""

She got penalized by the IRS for her husband not paying his 2005 taxes, so she's on the warpath about that. ""I didn't even know him in 2005! I'm gonna go find out who all those IRS guys were dating back then and send them bills for their girlfriends' credit cards."" Call me crazy but I don't think it works like that.

She got a jury summons and was the happiest woman alive. ""I hope it's a family law case, I can probably give the attorneys a few pointers.""

Finally, we have a sexy mailman here at the office, and I'll take pains to get myself out on the porch when he's filling those boxes. I wasn't actually thinking of him the other day, but walked out and he was there, and CW was behind me. She loudly said, ""Damn girl, you were right. I see why you want him to...deliver a package to you."" He turned around, gave us both a disgusted look, and walked to his mail truck. Worse than cockblocking: I got clam jammed.

*Quotes from the CW* - Here is where I'll give some of her one-liners, presented with no context for your reading pleasure.

* ""Ain't nothin slower in my neighborhood than a tweaker in a hurry.""

* ""I have a dildo just like that! Haven't ever used mine to knock someone's teeth out though.""

* ""That's like something from the movie The Eyes Have Hills.""

* ""Yeah, they're just like me. Hot and heavy in the beginning, then they fizzle out after the good part.""

* ""She's bipolar again this week.""

* ""I feel like I got body lice all over, I'm so itchy!"" *scratches furiously*

"The Coworker Chronicles: Boobs, Possums, and How to Digest Chocolate",30,4mevtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4mevtv/the_coworker_chronicles_boobs_possums_and_how_to/,1,1464985856.0,"**On a Tuesday in April...**

Today CW wanted to talk about boobs. I'm having some difficulty finding a reasonably priced strapless bra, and most of my clothes need one (I usually just tuck my straps on the side but it looks terrible) so she started telling me about her Victoria's Secret experience. Apparently her boobs are a cup size apart, so she buys water bras and fills the side that needs it, or buys heavily padded bras and removes the pads from one side to put on the other.

She is also 100% convinced that bras cause cancer because ""when all that shit's smashed in there together it just causes bad stuff to happen.""

Using her flawless logic, I'll now be burning all my bras to do what's best for my boobs.

Comments during the Boobversation: 

- ""If men had tits, bras would come free with every Happy Meal, oil change, and visit to the strip club."" 

- ""If men had boobs, they wouldn't need women anymore."" 

- ""If my B.O.B. could cut the grass, I wouldn't need men anymore.""

- ""Hell, they have vibrators that fit in your computer, they might as well make em that do something useful.""

(She and her husband are talking about a divorce again, so she's reminded me daily how happy she is to have a B.O.B. in her life.)

Speaking of divorce, they're discussing it because he lied on his taxes about a bunch of stuff and it affected hers (which she had already filed) so now they're being audited because he only claimed like $2,000 when their company made a lot more than that. She covered her ass, though, and called the accountant, somehow getting it straightened out. But now she wants a divorce again.

She knows I'm taking my ServSafe exam Monday and offered to get our client that she was so involved with a few weeks ago to train me because he's a ServSafe manager. So she's talking about getting a divorce, and offering me tutoring lessons from one of our clients who is literally going to court in a week about his own divorce...

I haven't mentioned her oldest son a lot, usually the drama is with her youngest. But her oldest got kicked out of his dwelling place and moved in to live on her couch (I guess her other son's girlfriend had enough and went back to her man, because he's trying to work it out with his baby's mama now). 

Her younger son has cameras all over the house and in the yard, because why wouldn't he? He noticed some money was missing and went back to check the tape and it was his older brother stealing from him. The older brother had a meth problem in the past, and she is worried that because he's stealing money now he's got the same problem. 

The younger son also had his truck in the front yard ""hanging in a tree""...when I asked CW what that meant, she said he put a pulley system in a tree by the house and uses it to jack the truck up to work on it. When I mentioned that might not be the safest option, you know, if a branch breaks and makes a tire pancake out of her son, she reassured me that he has a few stacks of cinderblocks around, so if the truck falls it'll knock those over first. I asked what would happen if they happened to fall over on his head, and she said ""hell, maybe it'll knock some sense into him.""

So the younger son goes back to check the video from the cameras pointed at his truck and, surprise of all surprises, his brother stole a large, heavy chain out of the bed of it. He went on a rampage, there was a fight, CW pulled out her gun and ""controlled the situation"" (she fired a warning shot into the air. Do not ever do this.)

She also informed me today that she's a ""breath holder""...when she got her tattoo she held her breath and passed out under the needle. When she's stressed or in pain she just holds her breath without knowing it. She told me that when she has sex, half the men she's with will stop and make sure she's still alive because she stops breathing while in the act. (Hun, you're not doing it right.)

Finally, I hate to end this on a sad note but a neighbor found one of CW's cats dead in her yard yesterday. She said the cat had been missing for about a week, and when she found her it looked like she had been attacked by a hawk (which is not uncommon around here), so she wrapped and buried her and had a small funeral in her backyard. CW was pretty upset about it, I'm going to bring her some flowers and a little stuffed kitty tomorrow.

Today's Coworker Chronicles is dedicated to the memory of Kitty Tina Turner, named so because she had very long back legs and liked to walk in circles. Rest in peace, KTT.

**4/20 - Thank God I Smoke a Ton of Weed**

I got to work a little early today. When I arrived, CW was fighting with the shredder. Not like trying to dislodge paper from it or anything; she was kicking the bottom bin that the shreds fall into and calling it a dumbass over and over again. I unplugged and unclogged it, it worked for a few more minutes then overheated and shut off. ""This thing is supposed to take 8 sheets but that's a buncha malarkey.""

She said again that she wanted to take the paper shreds home and let her grandson play in them; when I mentioned that inhaling the powder from the shreds probably isn't the best for him, she said ""oh I'll just give him a handful at a time, tell him to throw it then run away so he don't breathe much in. It makes good mulch anyway, and maybe he'll build a snowman out of it or something.""

Speaking of the grandson, he's afraid that a possum is going to get into the house because there was one on their porch last night eating some cat food. There is also cat food in the house, so he slept in CW's bed last night out of possum fear.

She's writing her two sons out of her will, which is causing family drama because she's giving her house to her son's baby's mother so her grandson has a place to live. This is if, god forbid, anything should ever happen to CW. She may outlive all of them though, just out of spite.

She said her son has been bringing home random items lately, like a new filing cabinet and a coffee table. She has no clue where he's getting it from, and doesn't seem to care. ""I ain't asking questions when I'm getting free new furniture!""

She found her dog chewing on a piece of moldy pizza last night, which really freaked her out, so she's going home today to deep clean and make a little headstone for Kitty Tina Turner.

She spent most of today narrating her Facebook pictures and videos for me, which is her favorite thing to do when I have lots of work to get done. She also did her couponing for the week.

A very large dog came up on our porch at work; I got him water and she took pictures to put on Facebook so we could find his owner. We moved our phone outside and hung out with the dog for the last part of her time here, until his owners came looking for him; it ended up being the owner of my favorite boutique in town so CW mentioned how much I talk up their store in an effort to get me some discounted clothes. Totally didn't work but it was a nice try on her part.

She wore a fluorescent pink lace shirt today, ate a honey bun, and drank a coke and a bottle of spark energy drink.

**The Day Prince Died**

We are moving into a new office next week, and today we got a big new office printer and a new phone system that works with headsets instead of handsets, and CW is very confused and upset with these changes.

Our printer won't email documents to us, and I'm not exactly computer savvy, so we just kind of gave up on that and kept doing it on the old scanner. She said, ""You know it's a female printer, it keeps having trouble with mail.""

Her youngest son seems to have cleared his head about the girl he was cheating with; he told her to move on. This prompted a proud mother speech from CW. She told me her son used to be a gymnast, and he was training for the junior olympics. He was also a baseball player, in little league all-stars, just the perfect specimen of athleticism...until he smoked the ""devil's crystals"".

One of her older son's friends has gone nuts: he tried to steal a bunch of their tools, then one of their trucks, and when her son went out to confront him, he tried to run him over. They got him away from their property but he disappeared into the woods so now there is a minor manhunt going on down there (the police are involved) and CW is incredibly paranoid that they're going to try to come into her home.

She slept by her back door last night with a gun, just in case.

She said as she was leaving the gas station this morning (buying cigarettes and her breakfast) that a gentlemen stopped her and told her she looked like someone famous. ""I expected him to say [Leah Remini](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/649667378498834432/Ib6wMV-9.jpg) because I get that a lot, but he surprised me! He said I looked like [Mariah Carey](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150511/mariah-carey-435.jpg). It made my day!""

I hate to burst all your bubbles, but my coworker looks like neither of those women. 

Her thoughts on Prince? ""I didn't like him, he always seemed kinda queer to me. No man should wear pants that tight or silky shirts like that. But it is sad. Did he die from AIDS?""

Today she had a Snickers, a pack of peanut M&M's, two swiss cake rolls, and a spark energy drink. I asked her how she eats all that and stays so skinny and she told me it was because she was raised on chocolate so her body just knows how to digest it properly.

Which is obviously the most reasonable explanation.",2016-06-03 23:30:56
The Coworker Chronicles: Crotch Sweat and Backwards Farts,42,4meth0,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4meth0/the_coworker_chronicles_crotch_sweat_and/,4,1464985063.0,"**One Friday in April**

Every day when I come into work, I never know if CW will deliver on the ""holy shit did she just say that?"" level that I expect. Thankfully for all of us, I'm usually wrong.

CW and I are friends on Facebook, you see, so I've been able to follow all her family drama very publicly. She posted a picture of a book this morning entitled ""When Your Adult Child Disappoints You"" and tagged her son in the comments. A verbal war ensued. Basically she's calling him out on being a piece of shit and sleeping with his best friend's girl while he's got a baby and baby's mama living at his house. He thinks he should be able to do what he wants.

So last night he apparently got a hotel room with ""the skank of Dixie"". She read me the text message chain, which began with the words (from her) ""Son, she must swallow or have a gold plated pussy."" 

I'll give it to her, she has a way with words.

She told him she was kicking his lazy ass out if he spends one more night in a hotel with that ""white trash cum dumpster"". She told him that he should be ashamed of himself, and that his little harlot should have her sons taken away and given to their daddies, if she even knows who their daddies are. She told him he better go pick up his food stamp card and fill up their damn cabinets with food for *his* son and if he spent one penny of that money on her kids, she was gonna start throwing his shit out into the yard.

Someone called her and told her that her son was sitting in a truck in a hotel parking lot looking very upset; CW figured he got stood up by the girl. She sent him a snide text saying that, and he responded with an equally rude text about what a shitty mother she is for not supporting him always.

It turns out, he wasn't being stood up, he was waiting on the girl to come out of the hotel room, before taking her to the grocery store and buying her about $350 worth of food and drink for herself and her two sons. He then drove her to her home (that she shares with his former best friend, the same guy that beat his car to pieces the other night) and the best friend came out and kicked his ass.

CW was WAY too happy about that. ""He'll get what he deserves.""

All this was documented fully on Facebook. 

In other news, one of her cats is sick again with a respiratory problem. She tried to give it a hot steam bath...which obviously didn't work well...so she resorted to just steaming up the bathroom and holding the kitty in there to clear out his lungs. 

She's been doing this 3x a day, which uses up most of her hot water, so she's been taking cold showers this week.

Her grandson overheard her say that she had to ""go to hell"" (she was talking about going to work) last night, so when she got up today he said ""Mimi, I wanna go to hell with you!"" which to me, is just hilariously adorable. She didn't bother to correct him; now he just thinks she works in hell. I don't really understand the physics of that in a Christian household but, whatever floats your boat to Hades.

My favorite CW quote of the day came while we were talking about a Pirate Fest that one of the beaches not far from here does. She and her husband go yearly, and apparently last year she saw a couple of pirates that ""made [her] crotch sweat.""

She also told me a story about her mother telling her she got a tattoo of a mouse on her hip, and when CW asked to see it she showed her the area it should be, there was nothing there. Her mom said, ""dammit! My pussy must have eaten my mouse.""

**The Next Monday**

I start school today, and was a little late due to a meeting with the financial aid office, but it was still an interesting day nonetheless. When I arrived, we had a client in office who was picking up her divorce papers. She and CW were discussing one of the items she was getting back from her husband--a Bible, but not the right one. ""This ain't my Bible,"" the woman said angrily. ""Mine is a Celebrating Recovery Bible. This ain't it."" She also dumped the belongings she was retrieving on the table, among which was a bottle of pills. ""Now you know this ain't none of the good stuff. He kept all that for himself."" CW laughed.

She told the woman to call her if she ever wanted to go get a celebratory beer now that she's single. It was like having two CW's for a moment there. I didn't like it.

Meanwhile, in CW's life, her son has been sending suicidal texts to her and his baby's mama, with whom he's trying to make amends. She's been checking on him but says he ""don't have the balls it takes to do something like that.""

She and her husband co-own a business that cleans offices after hours. They recently got a write-up at their largest job for not properly cleaning, which she blames entirely on her husband. She took photos as proof and spent today going on about how much she hates him.

Apparently instead of working this weekend, he went camping. She did the job, then went to him, told him she was resigning as co-owner and would be an employee only. They fought, he insulted her kids, her son went nuts and made some threats, cops were almost called, just a typical weekend in Redneckaritaville.

She ate a honeybun today that she said tasted very sour. Once it was finished, she burped, and commented that her burp smelled like a fart, and now she's officially so stressed she's farting backwards.

I think I'm going to call him BM from now on. For boss man or bowel movement, since both are accurate.

So yesterday I mentioned this pub house and the fact that BM isn't making the money he thought he'd make. Well, a while back, BM decided that a crowdfunding campaign was just what we needed for a boost. 

The campaign involved authors donating books to give away as rewards for supporters. Once more the BS meter was tingling. But it gets better. The authors were also instructed to donate to the indiegogo to boost its rankings on the indiegogo pages. Oh, but it was totally okay, said BM, because he was going to pay the authors back for their donations. 

I know what you're thinking, isn't that fraud? Yes. Yes it is. In the immortal words of Billy Mayes, ""But wait, there's more!"" When this campaign started up, there was some grumbling from authors that it looked like BM was trying to pay his bills with an indiegogo campaign.

A bit of background. BM had an author that had recently bought back the rights to their books. Immediately afterward, BM moved across country to a place known for expenses and vices. So the fact that his big payout was suddenly gone seemed a bit suspicious. 

Well, the grumbling reached the ears of BM, and he promptly sent out an email. In the spirit of anomimity I'm going to paraphrase.

""I hope I didn't give you the impression that this campaign was about lining my pockets, it's about... Marketing and stuff. My only bills are rent and food, so yeah, this is all about the business.""

Interestingly enough, shortly after the campaign closed, BM met a foreign woman, married her and moved overseas. For those familiar with the overseas bride buyi business, you might think that's a bit suspicious (if you have Netflix, there's a documentary on the subject). Several authors have independently contacted me to tell me the same theory that I had come up with. 

Hmm. Curious behavior, right? Well, it gets better. Remember the email that said the indiegogo campaign wasn't about paying his bills? Shortly after leaving the country, BM sends his yearly, ""Why we're not making money"" newsletter. Authors had been questioning where the marketing we'd been promised we to. Well, in this letter, BM points out that the campaign was to keep the business, meaning him, since he was the only doing this for a full time job. (But that's a story for another time)

TL;dr: BM decides to run a fraudulent indiegogo campaign, buys a wife and leaves the country. ",2016-05-31 16:39:20
Anti-social boss and social media (Chapter 1),29,4lr8cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4lr8cz/antisocial_boss_and_social_media_chapter_1/,1,1464637321.0,"So, I'm using a throwaway account for this to avoid any future unpleasantness.

I joined an ""indie publisher"" (which is a small press that publishes a few books a year and isn't an imprint of a larger traditional publisher) a while back and apparently, my bullshit meter was malfunctioning. The head of this pub house, I call him Boss for this post, talked a good game about how he knew the things traditional publishers were doing wrong and he had started a pub house as his retirement plan.

my bullshit meter failed me that day, because that should've set off alarms.

However, I joined and slowly, but surely, my opinion of Boss deteriorated as I watched him flounder around. Around the time the SCOTUS ruled in favor of marriage equality, he went out of his way to inform all the authors at the pub house that they shouldn't be political and that everyone sharing about the ruling was going to alienate readers. My BS meter went off. Some of us had audiences that had LGBT members in it and not sharing about something so monumental was akin to not supporting the decision. We told Boss as much and he sulked for a time.

Fast forward to the Paris attacks. Boss went on a very public, very xenophobic rant about Muslims that sounded more like something you'd need a sheet on your head to say. Talked with a few of the other authors about calling Boss out on this, which we did. Boss claims that supporting homosexuality was political, but the very real threat of radical Islam was just stating facts. Oh boy. 

I now realize that I'm published by a racist and homophobe. (And according to stories I'd heard from the female contractors and authors, also a misogynist.)

Around this time, Boss starts posting passive aggressive statuses in the closed pub house groups about the fact that he was losing money and that people needed to be sharing the pub house posts daily. Boss was under the impression that people in Facebook news feeds wanted to be hit multiple times a day with ads for the pub house books for sale. This strategy had killed off the pub house's social media reach, but obviously, those not doing it, weren't committed to their careers. 

Recently, Boss posts a couple of statuses about the various issues he has with authors and more passive aggressive bellyaching.

Some authors fired back and encouraged me to speak up as well. So, I did.

I told Boss that rather than posting passive aggressive statuses, like a teen with drama issues, he should talk to people since he is the publisher. I also addressed his social media policies by telling him that some of us weren't on Facebook because we'd found new ways to engage readers. (I also told him that if these new methods of engagement weren't putting enough money in his pocket, he could always run another indiegogo campaign, but that's a story for another time)

Ahh, the digital applause I got from the others at the pub house that were tired of his crap. Of course, he kicked me out of the pub house, but I feel pretty good about that.  Shortly afterwards, one of his best sellers also got kicked out for something similar.

Side note: another author contacted me about the timing of his outbursts. She noticed that he goes on these type of tirades towards the end of every month and normally kicks someone out as well. He then offers to allow the author to buy out their contract (more on that later as well). This author believes that Boss is hurting for money so badly that he's taking it out on authors to get the excuse to kick them out and get a quick cash infusion to maintain his lifestyle.(which, will be a part of the indiegogo story.)",2016-05-30 22:42:01

We've also got a pretty strong retail presence in our area, selling refurbished cell phones, high-end cases, and cell phone accessories. 

It's normally a pretty moderately paced workplace, but we occasionally get the odd day where we've got more work to do than hands are available to actually do the work. Yesterday was one of those days - and I happened to be the only one in the store due to one guy quitting unexpectedly earlier that week.  

A middle-aged, upper class looking woman (UCW) with two kids 8-10 years old in tow came in about midday to drop off her phone. The sparknotes version is that she'd gotten the screen replaced, and it had popped back up due to a mistake in putting the new one on. Now it needed a new screen, and the old one was too badly mangled to be fixed. I let her know that she would not be charged for this since it was our mistake (and the screen was under warranty), and took it back to take a look.

Now, we close at 7, and this woman came in at 6. I was still working on phones and setting up special orders, and we'd had a TON of phones come in within the last two hours. Not to mention, the phone was ringing off the hook and I'd already had one couple go stalking out in a rage (""Are you fucking serious! That's bullshit!"") because I told them their screen replacement would take 2 hours with me being the only one working the store. 

I actually got more done than I realized by the end of the day, but by the time I got to this woman's phone, my heart sank.

The customer before her had taken the last white iPhone 6 screen. Crap.

Reluctantly, I call the number she left to explain, then checked with my coworkers at the other locations for extra screens. She returned for the phone, and I explained the situation once more.

> Drej: Ma'am, I'm really sorry about this, but the customer before you got the last white iPhone 6 screen. Now, I've contacted our stores in NearbyTown1 and NearbyTown2, and both of them have white screens in stock. If you'd like, I can ask one of the other locations if they could hold one for you, if you'd like to visit one of them tomorrow. 

> UCW: Well, I *need* this phone. I mean, I've got two kids that I have to communicate with during the day, I can't be without a phone. 

> Drej: Actually, if you'd like, we can offer you one of any of the refurbished phones we have on sale currently as a loaner phone until we're able to get yours fixed. We will need to take a deposit for the phone, however.

> UCW: I don't want to do that, I don't have a deposit. So, what are my options? I've got my two kids, I can't just not have a phone......Can I speak to a manager? 

I'd given her all the options I was able to give her. The phone itself was working fine, but the messed up screen was obviously a problem. The other problem was the fact that she was trying to do this just before closing expecting an immediate solution.

Ended up calling the manager currently available, as it was 6:45 at this point and this woman wanted an answer. With his help, we agreed that she could use the one black screen we had available until she was able to get into the store for the correct color. I took her phone back, put the new screen on in about fifteen minutes, and rushed back to her with a working phone that just needed to be charged. I then hurried to deal with the trickle of customers who'd come in to receive their repaired phones or try to ask if they could get theirs repaired right then and there. 

Dropped into my workplace today on my day off to pick up something of mine I'd left. Was informed by the head tech that while I'd done a good job putting the black screen on, the phone wasn't turning on at all and needed further repairs. In my rush to get the screen on before this woman lost her patience (and she'd been actually pretty civil about the whole thing, if frustrated), I'd forgotten to actually turn the phone off and disconnect the battery before working on it, thus causing a short. 

It was a busy day and a learning experience for me, but I'm coming from jobs where you NEVER keep the customer waiting. It was kind of comforting to learn from the others that I could slow down and take my time with this sort of work, and the customers could shut it and learn some patience if they wanted their delicate electronic device repaired.

I'm back, after a short, glorious vacation, and I might have missed The Coworker just a little. I was a bit late today (stupid time zone change), so this is a short one for you.

I got a letter from school saying my student financial aid application has to be reviewed and I may have to pay $6k per year out of pocket. CW was trying to help me look up some grants and scholarships but unfortunately, as an adoptee, I don't know my heritage and a lot are based on that. She suggested I might be part American Indian because of my dark hair (um, no. I could be a body double for Casper the Friendly White Girl, though). I told her I didn't think that was in my genetic cards, and she mumbled ""well, I could have gotten grants, but the white man took my tribe away.""

I left some fruit in the fridge here last week and today it was gone; I asked her if it went bad. She said yeah, it started looking puny, so she ate a kiwi out of the mix and couldn't stand the taste so she spit it out.

(Two weeks ago she told me she hates the taste of kiwi. She wouldn't have been able to stand the taste anyway.)

We have a client that is being funded by her pastor, which, as you can imagine in this line of work, leads us to believe the worst possible thing: this woman is sleeping with her pastor (although we don't know this to be true, it's happened before). The Coworker called the lady and gave her the amount owed, telling her, ""Just be careful honey, sometimes those pastors come asking for favors for Jesus.""

I brought her Burger King today (chicken sandwich with extra extra mayo). She left her Spark energy supplement and her hyper makers here today.

**Tuesday**

The Coworker's husband asked her to go camping this weekend. She told him no, she has to do her taxes, and asked him when he intends to do his. He told her he wasn't going to worry about it. She explained that when they got married, she had 5 years of unpaid taxes to fix for him, and now that they're separated, she ""ain't doing it again. If he wants to skip the tax payin', let him. He can get one of his girlfriends to pay em.""

The family drama story of the day was her son sleeping with his best friend's girlfriend. The two got in a huge fight (this is over one of the girls she dumped ice on last week) and aren't friends anymore. She had a lawnmower that belonged to the guy, and when her son went to return it, the guy came out with a baseball bat and smashed in the windows on his truck and banged up the doors before going after the son. He managed to get away, they called the cops but declined filing charges because, as CW said, ""he knew what he was getting into, ain't nobody to blame but him and his pecker.""

The girl is still staying at their house, and CW is more than ready for her to go. She told her son to pick a whore and stick with her.
I haven't heard too much more about the cats lately; the one that was so sick did end up living and she's now nursing it back to health. Here's to hoping they're all alive and well.

**Wednesday**

You guys, I'm not even sure where to begin today. The Coworker and I were both out yesterday. Me, for personal reasons. Her, because her family is batshit insane.

So remember that CW's son has a baby and is on-again off-again with the baby's mama (who lives in the house with them). He recently had an affair with his best friend's girl (who is sleeping on their couch), which caused all kinds of drama. Apparently her son was fighting with his baby's mama, when the baby's mama took off.
It was early morning and raining, and CW was yelling at her son because she loves the baby's mama like a daughter. She said her son is a screamer, he should have been born a woman. Anyway, after the two fought for a good long time, the girl left. CW made a Facebook post about this, tagging every one of her neighbors to be on the lookout for this girl. The post said ""my daughter in law is mentally unstable and is wandering around town. She is on meth. She shoots up. If you see her, don't approach her, just call me and I'll come get her.""

After about 7 hours, CW found the girl on her family's porch (the girl's dad is in prison and her mother is abusive, which is why she's staying with the Coworker). CW took her warm clothes, shoes, and took her out to dinner. She talked to the girl about getting help for her addiction. Then she took her home and let her sleep in a warm bed while she had a come to Jesus talk with her son about the situation.

Meanwhile, the girl her son had an affair with shows up and tells them all...THAT SHE'S PREGNANT. The Coworker says, and I quote, ""I will shove my hand up her vagina and pull that damn baby out. She better NOT be pregnant with my son's child, that trashy whore! She better pray God takes that baby 'cause if he don't, I will.""

At this point in the day, CW told me she needed to go outside and smoke a cigarette. ""Hell, I should probably just eat the pack, with all this stress.""

She's taken it upon herself to mentally fuck with the girl her son had an affair with. She's been sending her texts telling her if she stays in the house she's going to take legal action, and that she has contacted the woman's husband (yep, she had 2 boyfriends and a husband when she slept with CW's son) and DFCS and is gonna get her other 2 kids taken away.

She's having some issues with zits nowadays (I'm sure it's stress) but she says when she pops them she feels like she's squeezing a tooth or a little bit of brain out of them because they just ooze and ooze and ooze.

We're getting new offices next week, and moving into a bigger place that isn't right next to the bathroom. When I mentioned how happy that made me, she said ""every job I've ever had, I've been right beside a bathroom. I can hear every fart, every grunt, every smell."" I gagged a little when she said all that.

She watched the made-for-tv movie ""Strays"" from 1991 (it's on youtube) today. The movie is about a woman who moves into a home that's taken over by stray cats. The cats start killing people and taking over the home.

So basically, it's based on her life and is probably foretelling her eventual downfall at the hands of the cat society she's built.

Her stepdaughter also learned she was pregnant recently, and today she learned the baby is not her boyfriend's because they've only been together 3 months and she's 5 months along. CW's opinion? ""I love her but man, she's a bitch, and he's a big pussy for putting up with it.""

A picture of one of her grandkids was posted online from Easter. He was in a little pink button up with a bowtie and khakis, probably about 8 years old. She said ""Man, if that's what he wore for easter, no wonder he acts like a little [insert homophobic slur here]."" I asked her not to use that word in front of me, and she apologized profusely, and instead called him a little queen.

Much better, lady. Much better.

Today we ate pizza, she had her Spark and her hyper makers and apparently something else because she was WIRED.

It was a long day.",2016-05-09 23:31:58

**On a Tuesday...**

I was late for work due to a dentist appointment. When I got here, *** asked me what I had done and she knew a whole lot about it. It turns out she used to be a dental assistant, before degrees were needed to be such a thing. She told us a story about being on call one weekend and having a client with a crown that fell off. He called her (because she was on call...) and she answered and said ""sir, I'm currently drinking a beer, smoking a cigarette, and playing poker. You sure you want me to come in?"" He said yes, so she had someone drive her to the office where she reattached the crown in a drunken stupor. When I asked how she was allowed to do this without the dentist being present she said ""baby those things weren't important back then. He sucked on some nitrous, I fixed it, finished my beer, we were all happy.""

We updated some client lists today and one of our client photos (we have pictures beside each so we know their names when they show up) was taken from Facebook. It was the client and his new girlfriend, who *** says is a cam girl and a stripper. Sure enough, she logged on to the girl's Facebook page and she was actively recruiting new girls on her Facebook page (so classy, I know). She had a number of very revealing photos up, so basically I looked at not-great boobs all morning. She said I should apply; I could pay off my student loans in a year. ""It wouldn't be worse than anything I've ever done to make money, and with your tits you should at least make some money off of 'em.""

Finally, *** has some squatters living in her house. They're girlfriends of her son, and apparently she woke up this morning to find one in a haze on her couch. She woke the girl up by dumping ice water on her (better than kitty litter, I suppose) and kicking her out. As she was walking out the door, another one of her son's girlfriends came walking up the driveway with a key to ***'s house in her hand. *** flipped out, snatched the key, told the girl to mooch off someone else, then went inside and dumped cold water on her son too because ""he needs to cool off. He's like a damn cat in heat having all these trollops over.""

I was late so I'm not sure what she had for breakfast, but she still hasn't washed out the ranch pasta cup from yesterday and I'm worried it's going to start growing things in it.

She did bring two boxes of Pop Tarts though; I'm thinking she's leaving the honeybuns behind.

**That Wednesday...**

***'s neighbor's house caught on fire last night. She said when they saw the smoke they grabbed their water hoses and tried to put it out, which makes me wonder if this was a grease fire like stated or if the cops weren't wanted there for a reason. Anyway, they weren't able to get it out with the water hoses but the fire department was able to get there before it became a total loss. 

She spent the day on FB flipping through pictures, showing me before-and-after photos of each room. Now, I don't actually know this person, but I do feel bad for them, I just don't really care to stare at pictures of a house on Facebook for an hour. Every one she clicked she said ""that's gone. Gone now. Gone. Gone."" or if it were only partially damaged, she would describe it in great detail. ""It was amazing though, because the pan they said started it wasn't melted or anything but stuff like the microwave and cabinets were destroyed! It's just amazing how stuff burns."" 

I look at the picture. ""Dear, it's a cast iron pan. It's probably not gonna melt.""

She got pretty mad at a pen today that wouldn't write, she slammed it down on the desk in frustration and it burst everywhere.

*** did a lot of talking today. It was basically her rambling for 45 minutes about filing insurance and working for a dentist and her car and how much she loves to hate her husband (it just makes things spicier, according to her). 

[Here's her tramp stamp](http://i.imgur.com/B6EhcZm.jpg). 

Her son's girlfriend is back squatting on their couch. This morning she said she didn't have time to dump ice on her so she left the front door open and put a can of cat food beside the couch. ""Maybe one of the ferals will attack her and she will get out of there and not come back.""

She pulled forward a little too much when she came back from lunch today and hit the brick wall outside our office in her mustang. ""Just a little scratch, no problem a little nail polish can't fix.""

She said one of the other girls living with her is spray painting a bike pink in their front yard. ""I'm pretty sure it's stolen. And it's about to get stolen again. By me. It was a nice bike and she's giving it a new paint job! My house, my bike.""

Her husband has been giving her most of their work load yet he takes in most of the profit for it, in regards to her night job. She spent a good 45 minutes trying to figure out how to get revenge on him. Then he called and told her he bought a camper that he put in HER NAME and she got really excited and forgot all about the work issue.

She spent the last bit of the day laughing about how destructive her grandkids are and discussing her inability to buy them anything without it becoming trash immediately. Since they just go this new camper they have a pop up trailer for sale, and I suggested she turn it into a playhouse for the grandkids. ""They'll burn it down in a heartbeat."" I laughed and said, ""surely you're exaggerating."" No,"" she said. ""They'll really burn that shit completely down if they get the chance. Destructive little fuckers. I don't know where they get it from.""

She sent me to the store to get her a Coke today because her Spark energy drink and her hydroxycut just weren't giving her enough energy. She didn't eat anything.",2016-05-09 18:52:02
Employers lying during interview,39,4i37aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4i37aq/employers_lying_during_interview/,9,1462501376.0,"OK, here's the story. 

I go into a interview and I get offered the position and the hours are 9 to 6 Monday through Friday and I am a Lead Teacher. For those who do not know what a lead teacher is; I am responsible for everyone and everything in the classroom. Decisions are made by me and me only.  With that said. 

Monday,  first day- I go in fill out necessary paperwork, make small tslk, go over procedures and what not. I take a full tour of the building and I see the room that will be mine. I go back to the office and I get to how a teacher and a assistant teacher list their credentials from not following protocol with regards to a child, however,  the situation has been handled and it's all good. 

Tuesday- in office again doing paperwork over heard director if the program talking about the incident that she told me yesterday.  A boy fell and hit his head, neither the teacher nor assistant teacher notified the parent nor the director at the time. Later on in the day the kid hits his head again yet no one is notified. Later on in the day that same boy begins to seize. Instead of clearing the area THEY FUCKING MOVE HIM  and bring him to the then director and the parent has finally been notified. The father got a lawyer who got a judge to issue a subpoena as to what happened that day. As a professional that is insanely scary to hear. The place is under a legal investigation and the two morons who caused all this are still employed their hence being a liability.  The director knowing that I heard clarified that I was hired to clean up the mess. 

Wednesday- as if the crap from the day before wasn't enough to send me running..... I'm in the office again doing paperwork and I ask do I get a I-9 form. The director said that I would. Then she tells me that she can't hire me as full time and only part time, yet my hours are 9 to 6, 5 days a week. She said in order to be full time I must average 30 or more hours a week for 2 months before they can change my status. Here's the kicker;  part time does NO benefits. 

Thursday- I take off and go on two interviews.  (Wish me luck). 

Friday- I ask when I will be able to get into my room. I get told once I'm credentialed. I asked how long that would take and I got told from a week to a few months..... I go into the classroom where I thought I was just learning the ropes and the lead teacher in there tells me that she went into my room to get more bibs the day before. When she opened the sliding door rat shit fell out. And there were blankets with bite marks in them. Then she said that someone has to clean that up!!!! The ship was sitting in a classroom a whole day with people knowing already. 

The best is my classroom and this classroom are separated by a baby gate and we have infants on the floor.... 

Needless to say that I quit the job. 

But was I right to leave?

Edit: I called the NYS Department of Labor and they said essentially an employer can lie to you and there's nothing that they can do about it. I got a little smoking gun in the fact that I was hired for full time hours, yet receive a letter from the parent company advising me to go get ObamaCare through the NYS Marketplace.

After sending off three people the same day because of the aforementioned permit policy, enters a girl saying she needs two lavalier mics and a recorder to record an interview with a big shot director. This is highly unusual. We can't let her have equipment without permission, though. She says she has talked to the headmaster, and he gave his ok. Now, the headmaster is not easily available, so it sounds a little fishy. My boss isn't there, he's teaching a class. I have strict orders to only give stuff to people with papers. I ask her to talk to the headmaster again and call our department so we can believe her. She leaves, and we get a call. The headmaster confirms that the director is downstairs waiting to be interviewed by the student. Cool. I just had to follow protocol. I fill in the forms and prepare the equipment. She doesn't check if it's working, she's in a hurry, takes everything and leaves. My supervisor makes a joke that she would be back ten minutes later asking if anyone could help her.

Ten minutes pass, she's back. She asks if anyone could help her with the mics. I'm not busy that day, and my supervisor lets me leave to help put the mics and come back. We get to the room they're recording the interview. The 90+year old big shot director is there. I know him by name but have never seen any of his movies. As I'm setting up the mics, he's talking about the time he met Federico Fellini, and Glauber Rocha, and almost worked with Orson Welles.

I'm stoked. I imagine how many stories the guy has to say, and I have to listen to them. I see the girl is alone and would operate camera, sound and interview at the same time. She's hopeless. She has no idea. I suggest that I could stay and help monitor sound so that everything ends up ok. The interview lasts a little bit over an hour, we shake hands and I get back to my department with the equipment. My boss is a little pissed off, tells me I shouldn't even went to set up the mics. That was strike one. But it was fine. Later that day, I get an email from her asking if I could help her interview other big heads from the industry. Oh hell yeah I could.

There's no pay off to this story. Just a cool thing that happened.

TL;DR: Hopeless girl comes to a sound department asking for mics to interview a film director. I get to help and listen to a man almost older than cinema itself talk about legends.",2016-05-05 00:34:18
"Ah yes, Mondays. How I love thee.",23,4gcz71,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4gcz71/ah_yes_mondays_how_i_love_thee/,5,1461585594.0,"Hey guys and gals, [this is me](https://redd.it/46ubrs). Ok, did you read that? Cool, we're all caught up. Today is Monday morning and as usual, I was the first one into the office...weird since I also live the farthest but hey, that's always been my experience. 

Anyway, I was off on Sunday (if you read my previous post, I don't live in the US so working days are Sundays through Thursdays. Our weekends are Fridays and Saturdays...just...go with it) because it's Palm Sunday for us Greek Orthodox Christians and so I came into work this morning....at 8am...and found an email from my boss saying that I had to go to a workshop being held by one of our most important donors....at 9am. Gee, a whole hour to prep. I was home yesterday, I wasn't travelling in outer space. Executive Director Dick (E.D.D.) could have sent me a text, could have sent the actual email (which I would have seen on my phone), could have even....gasp....called me to let me know ahead of time, but that's not the worst of it.

So he actually forward'ed (is that an *actual* word?) the email from the donor this morning and added a nifty little message to me saying *""Sorry for the short notice but I just found about about this. Are you aware of it? Did you talk to the project team yet?""* 

Except well, he hadn't just found out about it....because all I had to do was scroll down to the original email from the donor and see that they had sent it on APRIL f*cking 12th and his name is one of the recipients in the ""to"" section. It sat in his inbox for over a week until on a whim he decided to open it. Oh and today is the 25th, so he's also full of sh*t and probably just doesn't feel like going. But alas', he never actually checks his email so it's possible that it could have been sitting in limbo in his inbox waiting for someone to actually click on it. `Hard work, I know...what with all that time spent at his desk rummaging through the photo albums of random jail bait on Facebook all day, chain smoking like a champ and going back and forth to the kitchen every 10 minutes for a cup of coffee. What does he actually do around here again, nothing. 

Btw, this whole affair wouldn't have been so bad if I DID NOT HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW FOR A BETTER MORE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION AT 10AM....which I pretended was a ""meeting"" with some random potential stakeholder. Seriously, that was my cover. Who cares? He's not going to ask anyway. This is sort of an update to the previous post. I did manage to postpone my job interview until 2pm so that I could go to this stupid workshop this morning...and impress my (hopefully) new employers....and wholly crap did I f*cking nail that interview. Seriously, I didn't just kill it. I brutally murdered it in the most awesome way possible. So I expect to hear from them by Thursday and then I can give E.D.D. and his team of drama queens the ol' heave ho!",2016-04-25 14:59:54
I'm so close to cutting a bitch,33,4eww8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4eww8z/im_so_close_to_cutting_a_bitch/,9,1460729695.0,"Yay throwaways!

I figured there had to be a sub for this kind of thing and man, I wish I had found it earlier. 

So I started working at this place about a year ago and let's say things have drastically changed from what they were, which has impacted everything, because the office is crazy tiny. We're talking patchwork family-size.

The staff who trained me promptly left after I was able to pick up most of the work in theory and I was thrown into some major responsibility by necessity. A temp staff was promptly hired to help me do the amount of work which was absolutely meant for AT LEAST two full-time staff.

Now maybe we could've pulled this off somehow if the temp staff was quick on the uptake, but obviously that didn't happen. No, the LITERAL OPPOSITE OF THAT happened. The boss's friend's wife who hadn't been employed since the pleistocene needed some occupational therapy so that's what I got.

We deal with a slew of PDF and excel files everyday. A lot stuff is manual entry, so lots of room for mistakes and there's some technical understanding necessary (read, experience with how to handle certain inquiries). This woman needed help on how to update her Thunderbird, but ""she can do e-mail"" so I guess that was good enough.

My life since she has become part of the 'team' has consisted of trying not to kill her. I'm a shy person, who abhors violence, but I have violent fantasies of killing this person in multiple different ways. Since she started working here, I come home enraged many days a week. Now, incompetence is one thing, however in this case it comes with a KILLER combo of *incessant* and I mean *INCESSANT* talking and asking and disrupting my work flow. Again. Again. AND AGAIN.

I cannot escape this. She just never shuts her stupid mouth. The reason I cannot escape it is that for every 10 inane questions or remarks she has, there's ONE question that is actually valid and important that I answer. And for every 10 inane work-related questions there's double that time in completely random, forced smalltalk chatter she tries, because she seems to be allergic to quiet work.

I could go on forever. She's completely unable to prioritise. She'll ask me about stuff that doesn't fucking matter, when I know she has stuff on her desk that needs to be managed urgently. She comes to me to have me make decisions for her, because just taking some goddamn responsibility for whatever it is she does at a complete snail-pace would be asking too much.

To be fair, she tries and I guess she's not a bad person, but FUCK. That doesn't make me NOT want to rip out my ear drums when for the fifth time in five minutes I am assaulted by her Police-Academy-style high-pitched voice saying ""Can I just ask one question..."" and I'm just not allowed to say ""NO. NO YOU CANNOT. JUST STFU FOR ONCE AND DEAL WITH IT. THIS IS NOT ONE QUESTION AND WE BOTH KNOW IT."", not only because she's the boss's friend's wife, but also because she doesn't even wait for an answer she'll just interrupt me anyhow, sidle up to my desk and blabber away. Usually by asking something, that she's asked at least five times in the past week, which I've answered in an increasingly short and hostile way only to be told ""Aw why are you so down all the time? Do you not get enough sleep?"". And I swear if she tries to hug me again, I WILL either have a panic attack or a complete rage-blackout. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.

There's days where I feel like I just can't take it anymore. I'm thinking about quitting and changing jobs, because I just cannot come home every second day and feel like cutting the next bitch that looks at me funny on the bus or asks me something dumb and trivial. I already have a therapist for different issues, I really don't want to add this to the pile...

Say what you will, advice, comments, whatever... I just needed a place to tell this (other than my poor SO, who has had to listen to me rant in frustration so many times now).",2016-04-15 17:14:55

I have to deal with the guy every 2 weeks. He just moans, is negative and is generally a miserable character. The guy questions absolutely everything I do and this week was the last straw. But I still can not afford to lose his custom. 

Here goes, it was a matter regarding time. We are contracted to spend 4 man hours ""servicing"" every 2 weeks.  Normally it's 2 men for 2 hours each.  Easy.  

2 x 2hrs = 4

I am currently expanding so have to fit more jobs in per day so we took somebody else on. So now there are 3 of us. So, 4 man hours ....

3 x 1hrs 20 min = 4 hours.  Basic maths it would seem. But no, this guy worked out 1 hour 20 for 2 men and paid that amount as I was ""leaving early."" So I have basically had a pay cut. But it's still too big a job to lose, just less profit. 

Not to mention, as we arrived a company was just leaving and he told me ""they aren't coming back, they have an offer on where the first call is free.""  Now, there's nothing wrong with what he did, it just doesn't sit right with morals. It's also apparent this guy is all about exploiting the system...i suppose it would explain the mansion and garage this guy has. 

It sounds trivial compared to some stories here but it's grinding my gears, I leave the job and spent 2 weeks thinking about going back. What to do?",2016-04-09 11:14:57

BUT! I do have a few short ones to tie you over until she goes nuts again or something.

The tornado that touched down was only a mile from her house. She spent the day telling me (again) about being locked in a closet with her favorite cat and her son. I asked her how bad her damage was, and she said not much other than a few trees but that she got a friend to go up and tear a chunk of shingles off her roof so she can get a new one.

She went fishing Saturday with her husband, who is apparently nautically challenged. He got their boat stuck on a bank in the lake, and she got out to help free it. Well, so did he, and they freed the boat, but had to swim to it to get back in. Once they got in he decided to see how fast he could go.

Total count of items lost on the boat ride from hell:

- 1 hat (""my FAVORITE hat. He got it for me at Margaritaville when he was too drunk to stand."")

- 3 wine coolers (""I was able to save the one between my legs but two flipped out and one busted in the boat."")

- 2 fishing poles (""We fished one of 'em out using another pole but the second one is at the bottom of the lake somewhere."")

- Almost a bathing suit top (""Every time he took a corner or hit a swell my boobs went flying up to my ears!"")

- A bucket of minnows (""It flipped over and those little boogers started flopping everywhere. I started grabbing 'em by the tail and tossin' 'em in."")

She did, however, manage to hang on to her Cheez-it's and her other wine cooler (priorities, guys.)

I sneezed and asked for a tissue and she tossed me a container of Clorox bleach wipes.

I made pasta primavera last night and brought some in for her to try. It was a normal recipe, veggies and noodles with chicken, but she freaked out because she thought the chopped asparagus was green beans and when she bit it, she was surprised it was crunchy. ""I don't like asparagus, it makes your pee smell funny."" She told me the one thing that would make my dish better was a heaping of ranch, cheddar cheese and some bacon. She doused it with ranch dressing and ate the rest. (For reference, the recipe had aged parmesan and organic chicken, squash, zucchini, mushrooms, asparagus, peas, carrots, tomatoes, garlic, and a ton of spices. I'm trying to be healthy, not make my pasta into a baked potato.)

Today she had some ranch covered pasta primavera, a honey bun, and half my coca cola.

I am glad she's okay after the tornado, though, and I hope she can handle things while I'm out of the office Thursday and Friday.",2016-04-04 23:12:54

She was out of the office today because a tornado touched down not far from her home and some roads were blocked.

Wednesday, oddly enough, they were testing the tornado sirens in our town. She texted me early in the day and told me to be careful on the roads but I didn't think anything about it because it was 75 degrees and sunny outside. Yesterday when I spoke to her she said ""I heard those tornado sirens (sigh-reenes) going off and I picked everything up and hid in the bathroom 'til it blew over!"" I told her about the alarm tests and she just kind of sat there for a second. ""I didn't know they did that!"" 

They do this 4 times a year.

So she sat in a bathroom for an hour and a half for no reason.

She left her hydroxycut here and called me in a tizzy yesterday morning because her ""hyper makers"" were missing. I told her they were here, all was well. I'm not sure what she's doing to make up for the caffeine loss. I'm afraid to ask.

Today's [texts](http://imgur.com/a/wow8K) were frantic and unreadable, after the tornado last night. When I spoke to her earlier she said most of her cats are accounted for and she thinks the others are just waiting out the storm.

For all her silliness, she did help me figure out another issue I didn't know anything about with a client, and called a few times yesterday to make sure the office wasn't up in flames.

The Coworker Chronicles: What the Fuck? Wednesday,47,4cmjdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4cmjdf/the_coworker_chronicles_what_the_fuck_wednesday/,9,1459368304.0,"The Coworker Chronicles: What the Fuck? Wednesday

Today's conversations with *** were lengthy and plentiful, so I handpicked the best for you fine folks. To start us out, she went on and on about how thin the walls are in her house and how the sound of her son having sex with his girlfriend kept her up all night, so she was grumpy.

3 of her cats are now sick. She says she has to chase them around the house daily to administer their antibiotics. Two have escaped and are living under the house ""with the ferals"" (she has about 2 dozen feral cats that live beneath her home).

She had a bunch of mysterious bites on her arm (spoiler alert from a former medical professional: they're flea bites) and she was scratching all morning; she said she needed to go pee on them to for some relief. I gave her some tea tree oil and lavender. Fortunately she didn't have to pee on her arm after that. She asked to smell the rest of my oils so I gave her some peppermint oil and strict instructions to keep it away from her eyes. So naturally, 5 minutes later, she rubbed her eyes. She spent about an hour cursing and crying. I told her water would make it worse, but she tried to wash it out anyway. It made it worse. I gave her some milk (actually it was half and half but who's counting?) and helped her wash her eye out. It was quite an ordeal.

Once that ordeal was over, she was amazed that the oils actually took away the itching, and asked if she rubbed peppermint oil on her lady bits would provide an arousing sensation (IT WON'T DON'T EVER FUCKING TRY THIS OH MY GOD NO). I said ""remember what it did to your eyes? Okay imagine that in your vagina."" She asked if any oils did work as aphrodisiacs, so I referred her to Google and moved on with my day.

Somehow while googling oils she discovered a trailer for the movie Spring Breakers, and wanted to know who Riff Raff was, so after a youtube tutorial, she spent the day replaying his videos and laughing at him (between the beibs, Nikki Sixx, and Riff Raff, what can I say? she likes trashy white guys.)

The other cat tales I heard today included one about Rusty the congested cat eating his snot rockets (again. EW EW EW). The other story was that if one of her cats throws up she yells ""HOT MEAL!"" and waits for the other cats to come clean it up. By eating it, of course. (I just threw up in my mouth typing that. HOT MEAL, GUYS)

She has somehow acquired a small dog, I'm not sure when she got it but hey, now she has a dog. She said it has shit in her bed every day for the last week. I explained that if you take time to house train a dog, it won't shit in your bed, and she disagreed vehemently. ""I swear! He was trained when I got him he just lost it and wants to shit all over my bed now!"" When I said this could be a result of staying at home without being walked for 10-12 hours at a time, she said ""well, it doesn't bother the cats!""

She's trying to keep her grandson from cursing (because he hears it a lot living in that environment) so she has started giving him ""replacement"" curse words. Instead of Goddammit he can now say Beaverdamit. Rather than shit he can say pushit (anybody else get a Salt N Pepa flashback just then?). For fuck he just says duck.

She's been arguing with her husband about their night business a lot lately so she blames herself for her grandson picking up these curse words and she's been praying nightly for forgiveness. She said when she was little, her mom told her God had a big poster with everyone's name on it and if you were bad you got a black star and if you were good you got a gold star. She went into this lengthy description of how she still thinks of that to this day, and she's worried she's got a black star now for the cursing. I assured her that her teaching the boy that it was wrong and trying to work on it was surely enough to turn the black star gold but she swears once the star is there, it can't change color. You just have to do more good stuff to get more gold stars.

She ate a honey bun today, and drank a Coca Cola with Spark in it.

She started to leave at 2:14 and got out at 3:38.

The Coworker Chronicles: Monday, Monday, Can't Trust That Day

Today when I got to work, Google Calendar was giving *** fits. She's convinced someone is moving all her scheduled appointments or that they're just disappearing.

One of her cats, Grace, has a uterine infection and she's very worried she won't make it. She left today to take her to a vet, but if it spreads to any of the other cats she's gonna end up with 36 dead cats at her house.

On Easter, her step daughter-in-law (I'm still not sure how this family tree branches) robbed a house with her father, and they're still on the run. 

She went fishing this weekend, didn't catch anything, but had a good time. She spent about 30 minutes describing the fog on the lake and how they got lost in it. She thought she was going to die (on a pretty small lake in a very public area). Fishing is really helping her marriage, though.

Another of her cats has been acting depressed and has run away recently. She thinks he's going outside to die.

I asked earlier if she found her gun, she said no, but went outside to smoke a cigarette and apparently found it in her car.

She told me again about the cat pissing on her clothes. I'm not sure if this is the same incident as Friday or if the cats are staging a revolution and peeing on her clothes every day.

Her son's baby's mama is supposedly running an illegal daycare. *** has been Facebook stalking her, collecting photos to take to the cops. She's keeping 4 kids without a license and isn't reporting her income to the child support office, which is costing her son a lot of money in child support monthly, and she's trying to get that number dropped. She said her son never gets to see his son, but that the child is pretty ugly so she doesn't think it belongs to her kid anyway.
She went to the courthouse with our client's mother to file some papers. The client's ex wife is now stalking the client and his family, trying to get him arrested if he comes into town. He wasn't with *** the other day, though. The woman followed her instead. She documented all this and is now trying to file stalking charges against the woman on behalf of our client (who is banished from the county).

She asked me if I liked Justin Bieber today, then spent the afternoon playing his music videos.

She didn't eat today, other than a handful of chips from my desk.

The Coworker Chronicles: Tuesday's Gone With The Cat

I really don't have a whole lot of insanity to share today, she was pretty quiet because her cat is still sick. She said she has to get her fixed within 48 hours or she may die. (I don't have cats and cannot verify the accuracy of this statement. I didn't even stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.)

She did have a lot to say about her husband today, though. She and Mr. Coworker own a cleaning business, and after hours they go to doctors' offices and clinics and clean up (hence the biofreeze from last week). It's her and her husband, and they've hired another girl to help them out. I hear stories daily about how her husband doesn't do much work and leaves it all to her, but this time he's apparently crossed a line. He left and went home, leaving the entire office for *** and the new girl to clean. She's pissed, and plotting his death, I think.

Her phone isn't holding a charge. ""I took it to the lake and got it a little wet but that shouldn't kill the battery should it?"" I recommended she take it to the store and see if they could figure out what was wrong. ""They'll just disconnect everything and I'll end up having to buy a new phone that they've put a bug in.""

She told me another story about one of her 48 cats but I'm not gonna lie, I zoned out and missed about 89% of it. Gist: She thinks the cat wants to be an outside cat now because he clawed a screen off a window to get out. ",2016-03-29 22:55:58

The Coworker Chronicles: Why Did I Come To Work Wednesday

I was out yesterday due to a pinched nerve and a lot of sedatives, but don't worry, *** made sure to [text me](http://i.imgur.com/nbRElMn.png?1) her daily drama.

Today's conversations were just as entertaining. She has decided she can get an exemption on her taxes because she's ""American Indian"" (she's about as Indian as the Land 'o Lakes butter lady). 

When we were talking about my back injury, she mentioned she was in a minor accident when she was 16 that didn't show symptoms until she was in her late 30's, so this might really be pain from an accident I had when I was 16 (it's not).

Her hand is still swollen though she is on antibiotics now. She's begun tracing the swelling just in case the doctor gave her something to make it worse instead of better, to get more money out of her.

She's inventorying everything in our office (holy cow I didn't know inventorying was actually a word) by taking photos of the labels and making an MS Publisher file. Remember, *** and I are literally the only two people in this office besides our boss, who paid for all this shit in the first place, and has all these numbers on file already.

Then she got on Facebook. She showed me her son's girlfriend, who she says sells drugs and needles, she swears. She flipped through each picture of her going ""don't she look like a whore?"" ""Can you believe that skank?"" ""What trash."" Then she stumbled upon a picture of her mother's car, a c28, that she intends to make hers (she loves muscle cars).

Finally she went onto the client's page that she's so attached to. Yesterday she went to the courthouse on his behalf, because down here we still do things like banishment for certain crimes, and he is banished from the county his daughters are in. She pulled up photos of his daughters and cooed over them, then pulled up a picture of his ex wife and talked about what a heinous bitch she is.

Before she left, she told me if I need any painkillers for my back she will get me the hookup. She also offered to steal BioFreeze and deep tissue massage oil from the orthopedic office she cleans. I said no to the pills but that biofreeze shit is expensive. May take her up on that one.

The Coworker Chronicles: Traffic Court Thursday

*** had traffic court today for a speeding ticket. She decided last minute not to fight it, pled guilty, and came out better than she should have. This is good, because we were literally expecting a call from someone asking us to bail her out. She threatened to ""give someone a reason"" to give her a traffic ticket, presumably by mowing down the judge in the middle of town square. But she didn't! Good job!

I bought her a celebratory lunch at J. Christopher’s today; she was very confused by their To-Go Menu (“Why does everything have eggs on it?” “Because it’s a breakfast place.”) Before I left to get it, she regaled me with a story of once getting a sandwich with so much white sauce she named it a “cum sandwich.” Great way to whet the appetite.

She did, indeed, steal me some biofreeze, but it's not in the [container](http://imgur.com/a/V7VZV) I expected. (The pill bottle has massage oil inside.) 

Today, she watched videos on youtube with groups of rednecks fighting and lamented the fact that they ""looked like some of her people.""

She did, however, help a client out of a bind today. For all her faults, she knows our state's divorce and custody laws like the back of her hand. The attorney is out, she got the client hooked up with the information needed and sent him on his way, without having to think twice about what he needed. It was actually kind of impressive and melted my cold, dead heart just a little.

There may be more to add, I've got two hours of *** left, but I'll most likely add it on tomorrow, because I don't want to make her more paranoid than she already is.

The Coworker Chronicles: Go the Fuck Home Friday

Today, upon my arrival, the coworker asked if she reeked of cat piss. I reassured her that no, she didn't, but she went on to explain that her cats had pissed all over a pile of clean laundry, as well as the boots she was wearing today. She already washed them once in the work sink but wanted to make sure another round wasn't necessary.
We listened to a lot of country music in the office today, and she watched a lot of car videos. She was disappointed when they didn't wreck. Aren't we all?

She was complaining about getting calls from the Red Cross too often, and said she's not going to donate blood anymore because their telemarketers won't stop harassing her.

I got another Cat Tale from her this morning: Rusty, one of her 43 cats, has sinus issues and sneezes a lot. Well, this morning he was sitting on her table and he sneezed a huge snot wad into her coffee then tried to eat it.

We ordered a pizza today. She was very happy about the chocolate lava cake I surprised her with. So happy, in fact, that she ate mine as well as hers. (“Oh, I thought both of these were for me…”)

She went on a crazy cleaning spree before she left. She began leaving at 1:54 PM, but got distracted 3 separate times and didn't make it out until 2:17 PM.",2016-03-28 21:13:41

I'm a recruiter for an international big-box retailer and work in our Canadian Headquarters. Since today is Easter Monday, a lot of people either took today off or booked off a full week of vacation to extend their long weekend (smart way to maximise vacation use). Ironically enough, I was on TFR and looked back to me computer to send an email to a hiring manager. Candidate is from one of our stores and is interested in a corporate position - my job is to connect the two client groups and develop our internal talent.

Anyways, this email was to forward the store candidate's resume to the hiring manager for review. Outlook nicely tells you when a contact has an Out of Office message set so you can adjust your expectations of a semi-prompt response. This particular hiring manager has the following OOO message currently set:

""I am away from the office Thursday March 24th - Friday April 1st and will not have access to my email. I will be back in the office Monday, December 14th and will respond to your message then.""

Black Friday/Christmas season/Boxing Day is naturally our busiest time - guess she needs a few months to prepare for the chaos? I'd love that much vacation time.",2016-03-28 20:44:28

The Coworker Chronicles: Hey, Don't Eat That

Today *** was drinking her Spark energy supplement when she mentioned she sometimes likes to sprinkle a little on whipped cream and eat it for dessert. I told her that was probably not healthy, she giggled and said she'd die happy cause it was delicious. (Look up the ingredients. It's not delicious.) 

Her knee is bothering her today. She checked the weather and it's supposed to be raining tomorrow so she warned me she will most likely call in because if it's raining she wants to stay in bed. Her grass is still not cut, and she's running out of cat litter for her 27 cats.

She told me she had to pee 8 times today, and is pretty much in a constant state of hot flash as of late, so my office is about 45 degrees right now. 

As far as St. Patrick's day...she wasn't wearing green but had on green mardi gras beads that looked...well worn. She told me 3 times she was wearing green underwear (twice upon coming back from the bathroom, I guess she forgot?)

She spent today scouring Google Maps, finding out if there were satellite cameras in her trees (not a thing) and wondering how they got the street view (if you think I'm about to show her that car and have her hunt it down and drive it off the road you're crazier than she is).

I learned today that she has a ""pet cemetery"" in her yard. Not sure what to do with this info yet.

The Coworker Chronicles: Just Another Manic Depressive Monday

*** wasn't in the office for very long today. As a matter of fact, I got called in early because she got attacked by one of her 32 cats. I received [this text](http://i.imgur.com/uhYx2YU.jpg) this morning. 

She said when she goes to the hospital she's going to see if they'll give her a prescription for anxiety (that she doesn't really need) so she can pass it along to the client mentioned previously. When I mentioned the illegality of that, she said ""hell, if people in [the town where she lives] bought pills legally every time, half the trailer parks here wouldn't have renters because they wouldn't be able to afford it.""

Today for breakfast *** had a honey bun with Spark energy supplement sprinkled on top. For lunch, she had a handful of Lortab.

Today, *** was very upset about her son. Her husband gave him $300 Friday to give to her, and she hasn't received it yet, she is certain he has stolen it and is smoking it away. 

Meanwhile, at work, she has taken a personal interest in one of our clients to the point she's given him her cell phone number and has bonded him out of jail using her house as collateral. Yes, the guy's ex wife is batshit insane and keeps having him arrested on trumped up charges, but again, he is a client that she met through this law office. She's currently researching the law to see how she can get the guy's ex wife arrested. She has somehow gone to the courthouse and passed her personal phone number along to the ADA, and is now sending emails to me and the lawyer regarding the case and how we can help (we have 93 clients. This guy is one, but he hasn't paid us in 6 months. She has been covering his tab.) 

Today, she ate a honeybun for breakfast and had a cigarette for lunch. She's currently reading the Official Annotated Law Code for the state.

3.15.16

*** has become so enthralled with the case of the client mentioned yesterday, she took it upon herself to schedule a telephone conference with the ADA (this is NOT something part time legal secretaries do). She confessed to me that she's got a side account and is saving up money in an effort to make sure he has enough money to skip the country ""if shit gets bad"". 

She got an animatronic dog yesterday (think Teddy Ruxpin as a dog who runs off bluetooth) and today she played praise and worship songs through it all day. She bought an extra one of these for the daughter of the client mentioned above. 

I offered her a chicken salad croissant today. She said yes until she realized there were no pickles in the chicken salad, and that it had grapes. ""I only like grapes in liquid form. Heh heh.""

Today, I arrived on time, to hear *** yelling ""dangit!"" at her monitor. I sat down and offered her a strawberry, but she said her teeth were hurting (she has a lot of dental issues) and she was trying to only drink Spark energy supplement (look it up, it's terrible) and not actually eat. 

She said her husband wants to go fishing this weekend, and she knows she should go with him because his birthday is some time this weekend but she can't remember which day (they've been married for 10 years). She also said she needs to stay home and mow the lawn because nobody else is going to do it and they lost a kid's toy somewhere in the tall grass last week so she knows it's time to cut it.


*** also lost her gun. She said she hopes it's hiding under the massive pile of clothes in her closet but if it's not in her closet or her husband's closet or her bathroom cabinet or her dresser then her son stole it, and that's the last straw, she's kicking him out and pressing charges.

She said our client that she's so involved with (who she spent the day researching for) just needs to take a baseball bat to his ex wife's head, and that she would be happy to do it for him.

Finally, she asked what would increase her libido because she would rather vomit spaghetti than have sex with her husband (all said while I was eating lunch). She then started researching various herbal remedies to put her in the mood, giving me a graphic description of how quickly her vagina dries up at the thought of sex with him.

Security and Wannabe cops. A group interview.,58,48u9i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/48u9i7/security_and_wannabe_cops_a_group_interview/,8,1457042615.0,"I went to this group interview yesterday

A man from the company said: ""We are hands off security, just there for presence, all you have to do is be nice.""

Simple enough, but out of all 15 of us in the group, at least 8 of them struggled to grasp this concept.

...It nearly took them 3 hours of the time we were there to explain this to a guy who said he was ""the colonel of the local town militia"" (In light of recent events in my state that is NOT something you want to bring up and say to a company that worries about those liabilities) and he said as soon as someone fights he's taking them to the ground and giving them a citizens arrest.  This is after the Vice President's 25 minute explanation of why their company does not do citizens arrests and the base of all we need to be... are good witnesses.   

While the VP moved topics and discussed 401k, benefits, breaks and etc.   Another guy interrupts him halfway with a story about how his neighbor would get into fights and call the police and he asked the vice president if he can make a citizens arrest in that case.  After which story teller gets cut off by an older middle aged woman who mentioned she thinks she knows the answer but pulls out her phone and begins quoting state laws about speed zones.  ""Colonel Militia"" man cuts her off and they start a heated argument, I was tuned out but phrases of ""Obama needs to be impeached today"". . . "" I'm not sure who I'm voting for yet"". . . "" I still think we have the right to use pepper spray and take people to the ground"". . . ""I baby sat a dog"".  

End of the meeting, the VP asked if there were any more questions, everyone said no.  Then as he's giving his closing remarks 12 hands go up with very irrelevant and ignorant questions. 



This whole meeting could have been done and over with in 20 minutes.  

I was amazed several of these people were never asked to leave.

Needless to say myself and one other were the only one's given tax paperwork to fill out at the end of the night.

I'm pretty sure that's wrong…,64,47r3ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/47r3ax/im_pretty_sure_thats_wrong/,8,1456518155.0,"I had to make a large (50L) solution of 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid. Really nasty stuff.

The way to make this (and ANY acid solution) is to fill up the container with water, usually about 10-25% of the total volume of the solution. The acid is then added to the water, and the solution is mixed thoroughly before being diluted to the final volume.

The reason for adding the water first is to prevent the acid concentration from being too high. When mixing water with acid, the solution will generally heat up and give off fumes, so adding a small amount of acid to a larger amount of water minimizes the effect of the heat and fumes.

As I was filling the 100L container with the preliminary water, my supervisor walked by.

S: ""So you added the acid already?""

Me: ""No. I'm just filling it up a bit before I do.""

S: ""What?! Why are you doing that?! You're just wasting time!""

Me: ""… What do you mean?""

S: ""You always have to add the acid to the container first! That way, when you fill it up, the solution mixes! It saves time since we don't have a stirring system for the 100L containers.""

She stops the water flow, and then takes me to fill up a 50mL tube with the concentrated acid. She fills it up, doesn't cover it, and runs back to the container, pours it directly in, STICKS HER HEAD IN THE TOP OF THE CONTAINER, and swishes it around before turning the water back on.

She chastises me for not thinking how to save time and energy, and stops me from telling her it's flat out dangerous, then goes on her way.

This woman is in charge of an entire science department, but lacks any scientific training or background.

This isn't my story, but a colleague just got of the phone with a builder. A client's house is finished, and the construction company has sent us the total amount that needs to be paid when they come to hand over the keys and sign the deeds. There was a difference in price between what we had, and what the builder has.  
It turns out that (and this is verbatim) ""*The client has requested some 'special' extras, and asked us not to tell anyone, including you.*""

A short preface: I work for a real estate agency, 99% of our clients are foreigners buying a place in the sun, exclusively newly built or still under construction. All communication between client and constructor goes through me (at least, it is supposed to).  
You want to make changes to the house? Contact me, and I inform the builder to make up a quote.

On to the story:  
This particular construction group, lets call them ShittyBuilder ($SB), do not answer emails or are ""out of the office"" when you call.  
It has gotten to the point that my manager ($M) has gotten involved with several cases, as well as our general manager ($Boss).

Aside from not answering questions, giving wrong prices for additional works, wrong dates for completion of build, etc, $SB is unable to get a bank guarantee from their bank. This is not entirely uncommon, so we weren't too worried, builders can also get a financial guarantee through an insurance company.  
In June 2015, we requested the first bank guarantees, and were met with silence. We keep emailing and calling, by September they finally tell us that they should have them by November.

November comes around, of course they have nothing. They inform us the bank will not give a guarantee, but they have a financial insurance company coming to give them financial guarantees.  
We check again a few weeks later, they still have nothing. By now they have started building, two months behind schedule, and we can clearly see they will not receive any kind of guarantee. We inform our clients to hold payments until they have a guarantee, or until their houses are completely built.

One of my more vocal clients apparently went this weekend for a meeting with $SB without informing us (no problem, we don't work weekends anyway).  
Aside from price differences between what they initially signed and the current price given for some tiles and modifications around the house, $SB gave them the ""bank guarantee"" with a signed date of 2015/11/30 (November 30th), telling them that they had informed $Boss and our Legal department.  
That paper is merely an affirmation that $SB has a bank account with $Bank, signed by the manager of that office.

We have gone out of the ""incompetent"" region, all the way to ""lying to get money from clients"".

The wonderful world of working for an International NGO...when you're the only native English speaker...,32,46ubrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/46ubrs/the_wonderful_world_of_working_for_an/,9,1456039539.0,"I'm a PR/Communications expert that was hired to stabilize a struggling NGO in the MENA region. They basically hired me to come to the Middle East and pull them out of a financial crisis caused by reduced funding. Within 2 years, I managed to raise $6.8 million dollars in funding through various projects that I designed and that were greenlit by foreign donors, among some other spiffy little accomplishments. I'm basically the organization's Swiss Army Knife...since I have very many roles (most of them unofficially).

**The Executive Director:**
However, despite my best efforts, this organization is ultimately fucked....because the Executive Director is an uninterested idiot who doesn't care about his job as much as he does playing around on Facebook and chain-smoking like a champ (I keep the windows open...even in dead of winter b/c otherwise this place would reek like a giant ashtray). He only cares about money, the organization's money, and is too fucking cheap to approve of simple expenses that could really help out. Like buying real office chairs for all the staff (I went through 3 that broke and now I'm sitting at my desk on a metal folding chair). We had a meeting once and he told all of us, ""I'm not complaining about *my* chair. You shouldn't complain about *your's* either. If you're not comfortable, we'll get you a new chair but it'll come out of your paycheck and when you leave your job, you can take it home with you!"" (He has a big comfy leather reclining office chair). My job also entails working with the Finance Officer to make a budget for the projects and as soon as we're satisfied that we've made an appropriate budget within the donor's guidelines, he comes in like a bull in a china shop and demands to change everything to his liking, ""You have some good ideas but I'm the Executive Director and at the end of the day, what I say happens."" Then a couple months later, we receive a letter from the donor saying that our proposals unfortunately was not approved...and guess whose fault it is? Mine! After all, I wrote the proposal! 

**The Staff:**
As for the staff, they are all locals and 99% of them can't complete a sentence in English, despite the fact that the biggest donors of this office are from the EU and the UN and all of their communications are in English.....

Which leads me to my biggest problem. Because I'm a native English speaker, I have become (against my better judgement) the organization's English/Arabic translator. When I'm required to write quarter or year end reports for our donors...you know, so they know where their money is going....I ask for data in the form of internal reports from the actual staff that do the project activities. They ALWAYS send me these reports in Arabic, which I end up wasting weeks on end translating into English. Also none of the staff members know how to use Microsoft Office.....in 2016....so they always call me to teach them how to do stupid things like...change the document size in Word, or create a column in Excel, or add a contact to Outlook. And God forbid the internet goes down or their computers aren't picking up a wifi signal, I'm also the de facto IT specialist. 

The other day, one of our staff called me down to her office because she had a problem with the internet. It wasn't working and she couldn't log into the organization's website to update the news section. So, I dropped everything I was doing and went to see what the problem was. It turned out that WiFi button on her laptop was turned off. Another time, another staff member called me to his office and asked me to write a response...in English....to an email invitation asking him to attend a conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Only the invitation was in English, the conference most certainly will be in English...and he is asking me to write a reply to the email in English because he can't speak English! What's he going to do when he gets to Geneva and has to make a presentation on the work of the organization....in English?? BTW, I can guaran-damn-tee you that I'll be asked to create his presentation for him because I KNOW that he doesn't know how to use Powepoint....and...yeah, the presentation needs to be in English. I also love when they rely on Google Translate to create their own English-language reports, and when they send me the draft, I can't understand what the hell it says! So not only do I need to translate from Arabic to English, but I also need to decipher what that crap they cut and paste into the document in really bad English is *supposed* to say. 

The staff are also very unprofessional and dramatic as hell. They can't take criticism without resorting into a bunch of immature babies. On any given day, someone will get into an argument with another and you can hear them yelling and cursing at each other down the corridor. It's embarrassing. One time we had a representative for the United Nations waiting for a meeting with the Director, while he was yelling at the top of his lungs at the secretary for fucking up the printing order on some of his papers. I swear, that sometimes I feel like I work in a Daycare center. If one person get's a raise, the entire staff get jealous, pissy and hostile. They all feel like they're the best employee, they all feel like they're better than everyone else but...I'm the eyes and ears around here and I know that they're all full of shit. I know what they're doing when the  boss isn't around and I know what websites they're visiting when they should be working (like I said, I'm the de facto IT guy).

Rock Factory - Mornings,23,448bje,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/448bje/rock_factory_mornings/,1,1454633065.0,"Our CEO told us in a meeting once that our first, most pressing concern as employees was the customer. He actually picked a random employee at the company-wide meeting, called her out in front of everyone, and asked her what SHE thought was the most important thing at the Rock Factory. She guessed ""Continuous Improvement,"" which to be fair, was what the CEO said was most important in the last meeting three months ago. (Before that, it had been ""profit."") No, he said, the most important thing was the customer. We were to be thinking about the customer from the moment we came in in the morning. (And of course, despite the fact that second shift started after 2, he still said morning. Production people - especially those that showed up after he left - weren't really in his field of vision.)

Keeping our CEO's request in mind, most mornings I walk into the Rock Factory thinking about anything but the customer. On the chance that I accidentally do, my mind usually wanders to wishing that I'd offered ""safety"" as my opinion of what's most important. I could only imagine the CEO backpedaling after saying that the customer was more important than our safety.

As I walked deeper into the factory towards the time clock, I hear someone come enter the factory behind me... stomp. stomp. stomp. It had been a cold day, and at first I thought their stomping was just because they were trying to clean the snow off their shoes. As the stomping continued, I started wondering about it... it was cold, but there hadn't actually been snow on the ground. And they were still stomping. As I neared the office, a giant window was directly in my path. I tried to look at the reflection to see who was behind me. I wasn't sure, but I thought I recognized it as a guy with an anger management problem. Apparently, one time he ""went silverback gorilla"" at the factory. I don't know what that entailed, but I heard it was just in response to someone playing music too loud.

I kept progressing toward the locker room, and the stomping followed. In fact, it was intensifying; they were gaining on me. STOMP. STOMP. STOMP. I kept thinking about it... Mr. Silverback didn't come into work for probably two hours after the current time. It had to be someone from my high-speed work area... which probably meant it was someone messing with me. I tried to keep going without giving him the satisfaction of me laughing, but eventually I couldn't, and just stopped and doubled over laughing. It was just too good. He'd gone for almost 100 yards, stomping as loud as he could.

I turned around and saw it had been Redwood, the high speed area lead. We laughed about it for a bit before we went into the break room. He turned toward the locker room while I went for the vending machines. After I had a drink and clocked in, I went to go change, following Onions into the locker room. When he saw me, he held his fingers up, cocked his head back, and said ""Sup xuol"" in a unintentionally but severely douchey way. Redwood was coming out of the locker room as we headed in, and he rolled his eyes at Onions as I smiled and nodded. 

As we started changing, of course Onions decides to have a conversation. ""Hey man,"" he says, ""what are you doing for the holiday?"" 

""Hell, probably sleeping,"" I say, since I usually go to bed unfashionably early.

""Well, I'm going to a party, you wanna come?"" 

""Hell, probably not. What's going on?""

""Well, my buddy Bob inherited this house, and he made it a party house. It's AWESOME, it's just this huge, empty house. I mean, it smells like dog shit, but... [that's okay, because] PARTY HOUSE! Last time he had a kiddie pool full of Natty Ice, and people would stand on opposite sides and try to knock each other in with this one guy's crutches. Then the winner of the championship got to fight Bob, who was drunk, and he ended up just getting naked in the pool of Natty Ice. The Natty Ice wasn't in cans or anything. Just liquid. Wanna come?""

""Hell, probably not."" By this time, I'd changed clothes, and could flee Onions. The only other person on the way to the factory floor that I pass is Vinnie, this little Laotian dude who always throws his arms up and yells my name whenever he sees me in the morning. Today is no exception; we usually don't have anything to talk about aside from the meta of working at the Rock Factory, and aside from his excited greeting, we really don't interact. But he always greets me so enthusiastically... it never fail to put me in a good mood.

If there's one thing that's true of the Rock Factory, it's that the people keep it interesting.",2016-02-05 02:44:25

I've been reading work tales here and there, and figured I'd share some. Obviously names and locations will be changed to protect patient privacy.

**Ike:** I was working at my first hospital with this company, and had stayed at the hospital through Hurricane Ike to properly secure the facility. Mostly, this consisted of us evacuating as many of our patients as we could, and riding out the storm in relative comfort. We had massive generators, plenty of food stocked up, and comfy beds, so it was a relatively easy way to earn Disaster Pay and all the overtime I could handle. 

First day after the storm, the entire city is flooded, we don't do much at all. No visitors, only a handful of patients. 

Second day, the waters start to recede, still not doing much. A few patients come in by ambulance, but we're still turning away visitors and outpatient appointments.

Third day the people in the city find out that we have not only air conditioning (due to the previously mentioned generators), but also dry floors and power to charge their cell phones...

All hell breaks loose. We quickly have 1500 people outside our doors, demanding to be let in. The city Police stationed a bunch of officers outside, along with our Security, and some armed contractors we'd hired for the emergency, and for the most part, the crowd just mills about. 

There was this one guy, though, that I'll never forget. 

His underage girlfriend had come into our Emergency Department, in labor, and not having an easy time of it. We had her covered, no worries, but we weren't allowing ED visitation, since we were inundated with patients. 

So this guy comes in, demands to see her, and when he's denied, he starts threatening my ED nurses. He's gonna find their homes, he's gonna come back to the ED with his boys, you get the drift. 

When my partner (a tiny 35 year old housewife) and I (an average sized, if a little big, 25 year old guy) approach him, he demands we let him see her. We explain the situation calmly, and then he tells us he needs to go back to give her his phone number. 

""Your girlfriend is having your kid, and she doesn't have your number?""

""Nah. I keep my bitches separate.""

We offer to take the number to her, and ensure that she has it, but explain that we can't force her to keep him updated, and as he's already threatened people, we are certainly not going to let him back in the building.

He says the following:

""Man...muh fuckin' bitch ass nigga white people runnin' this muh fucka'."" 

And he storms off. To this day, it's the most creative set of words I've ever been called. 

**The King:** About three years ago I was working as a Security Officer in a large hospital in our division, and I'd been there for a few years. One of our duties was to sit with disruptive patients for safety reasons, whether it be for the patient's safety or for that of the staff.

So, I'm working day shift, and get a call to go to the building across the street from the main hospital, which is a part of our six building property, to sit with a violent patient, who we'll call ""The King"". 

He's got a patient sitter, a buddy of mine, who stays with him 24 hours a day because he requires that much attention. This patient is mentally deficient in some way (not sure why). He's got the mentality of a toddler, is non-compliant, and is almost completely non-verbal. Yes, no, phone, go...that's about the extent of his vocabulary. Mostly it's just gestures and grunting.

Blah blah blah, problems with his home situation, but no medical problems to speak of, so we can't transfer him to another facility. We've gotta take care of him until Adult Protective Services and the courts can work out where he's gonna go. 

So me and my buddy, who we'll call ""Batman"", are hanging out in this dude's room, which is right off of the Nurse's station. The nursing staff have had it up to here with this guy, because he's smart enough to demand things, but not smart enough to understand why we can't comply with his demands. He demands to leave by gesturing at the door, and when told that he can't leave, he screeches and throws things. 

He's also built like he was carved out of rock. Seriously. Dude didn't skip leg day or any other day. Strong as an ox, this guy.

So we're well into day two with The King. We've explained over and over and over that he can't leave, because the doctor says so, since that's the only explanation he'll semi-accept. He's had breakfast, and he is sitting in his bed, eating powdered creamer packets like they're ambrosia. No coffee, no liquid, just creamer powder. 

Batman and I are talking about gaming, and The King gets up out of bed and slowly approaches, listening. Wary, since we'd had to go hands on to keep him restrained before, we pause the conversation. He looks at us, a sly look on his face, and I take a step back to make sure I'm out of his reach. 

He grins, and launches a gob of half moistened creamer at me, spattering my all black uniform with foul smelling milky liquid. Then he utters the only multi-syllabic word I heard him say during his entire stay.

*""Nigger!""*

He grins even wider, and shrieks with delight, clapping his hands, as Batman quickly escorts him back to his bed. He starts singing the word, over and over. 

Most patients that I have to deal with either have some sort of psych problem, or have something in their system that doesn't allow them to control their behavior, be it drugs, or alcohol, etc. I can deal with that all day. No problem. 

Not this. This guy knew. He knew exactly what he was saying, or at least, the response it was designed to provoke. He did it specifically to get a rise out of me. 

It was one of the very few times I had to walk away to keep from losing my cool with a patient. 

**First Night:** So, my first night at the previously mentioned large hospital, I was training with another officer when we got a call for Security assistance in the Emergency Department. We went running down the hall, and could hear the screaming from the moment we entered the department. It was like a banshee was being held captive. We found the off duty PD Officer that works in the ED standing outside the door, and he nodded me in. I pushed the doors open, and found the source of the screaming. 

A skinny girl, in her early twenties, was arched up on her shoulders and heels, bending her spine in a way spines shouldn't bend, being restrained by several nurses and techs and shrieking about people wanting to touch her inappropriately.

Not complaining about it, mind you. Demanding. Demanding that someone...assist her. 

I should probably mention that she was completely naked, hence the closed doors. 

My partner and I closed the doors again, catching the PD Officer chuckling at having let us just walk right into that with no warning. We grabbed gloves, donned them, and approached the bed. We replaced the nurses holding her arms, and our uniforms apparently caught her eye. 

She fixated on us, and started demanding that we assist her in achieving fruition, shall we say, with our batons. Which we didn't carry. She screamed at us, demanding we comply. She managed to kick free of the nurse holding her ankles, and rolled her feet up towards her head, forcing her pelvis over her head, closer to us, as we stood at the head of the bed. 

We managed to put her in soft restraints, cover her with a sheet, since she clearly wasn't going willingly into a gown, and the nurses gave medication to help her calm down. She eventually went to sleep, though she kept humping the air, the blanket, and the bed rail whenever she could. 

We never did find out what was causing the behavior, but it made for an interesting first night...

**Shopping for a husband:** So, about a year after I started at this large hospital, I got a call to assist with an unruly patient. Most of the time, if I can, I'm going to try and de-escalate the situation. I might be able to take a patient in a fight, but I might not, and I'd rather not find out, so I try really hard to talk people out of fighting. 

This patient was a woman in her forties, with her husband and teenage daughter in the room. She was fussing about something that I don't even remember, but wasn't violent or aggressive. Just fussy. She refused to listen to the nurses, the techs, the doctor, so they called me. 

Cool. Sometimes a person with a badge, even if it's just a Security Officer badge, can calm things down just by showing up. 

Sure enough, that's what happened. Her whole demeanor changed. She was polite, calm, and chatty. We talked for a bit, and I came to understand that she was having problems with perception. She thought she was backstage at the Rodeo concert, and her husband told me they were in the nosebleeds. She was best friends with a celebrity, and I was informed that she'd met the person once. 

She turned to her daughter, who was probably 14 or 15, and said *""Sweetie, this is the kind of man you need. Good job, very nice manners...why don't you date him?""*

The daughter was absolutely mortified. 

I thanked her for the compliments. 

**""Well, I appreciate that, you're very kind. My wife would probably have a problem with me shopping for her replacement while I was at work, though. Also, it's kind of frowned upon when a 28 year old man takes a girlfriend that young.""**

She ""Pshaw""ed me, and suggested that age was just a number. 

**""Yeah, but there's still that whole wife thing.""**

She rolled her eyes. 

*""Well, if that doesn't work out, my girl just broke up with her boyfriend, and I'll make sure she stays available.""*

I thought the daughter's face was going to catch fire, so red it was. The situation apparently calmed down, I told her and her visitors to call if she needed anything else, and thanked her for her time as I left. 

**NOT MY GUMDROP BUTTONS!!!**: So, I was sitting in the ED with Batman one day, on a patient that had been violent, but was now asleep. From the next room, we hear a voice that I swear came directly from the Gingerbread Man from Shrek.

*""I'm just...I'm just so bored I wanna die.""*

Dude came in because he was ""suicidal"", though he later informed us it was just for attention. But I swear, he sounded just like the Gingerbread Man. 

Some of the more memorable things he said:

*""I have a plan on how, too. There's a fake plant at my grandma's house. I'll probably eat that till I die.""*

*""I don't want to cause problems. I just want to eat that fake plant. It probably tastes fake too. I wonder if hot sauce would make it taste better.""*

Lazy Manager is every TV Office Character rolled into one.,12,42czeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/42czeq/lazy_manager_is_every_tv_office_character_rolled/,4,1453586632.0,"Introducing LazyAss. This co-worker of mine is the cookie-cutter textbook example of a lazy a**hole who brown noses and gets by with the bare minimum of work.  How he got hired as a low-level manager is beyond me as the guy is completely inept at everything except getting his reports in on time and ordering others to do his work.  He's got just about every ""office"" character stereotype rolled into one douche-bag.  

* If upper management requests a task, he delegates out the entire workload so he's left with nothing to do except claim the credit for the work.  
* The reflection from his computer screen on his back office window shows he's playing facebook games or some sort of browser game nearly all the time.  He ALT+TAB's the moment someone walks in his door.  
* Doesn't know how to use even the most basic of Excel functions so he gets me to do all the calculations he is supposed to know given he's got a business degree.  
* When LazyAss was hired, he had our company purchase a Keurig coffee machine along with the K-Cups just for his office so he could entertain clients.  In a years time, he's used it a grand total of 3 times for guests, but nearly every day for himself. The rest of us have to use the office coffee pots in the breakroom. 

Now to the story:  

So I am the Reports/Forms/Analyst guy at my company.  My actual title is very different from what I do because I work in the IT department.  This is important because LazyAss considers me his Go-To-Guy for just about everything technical.  My duties are to do reports and coding projects for 4 other departments but my Projects list is nearly 75% him making requests.  

A few months back, I was assigned a rather lengthy ""urgent"" project from the Sales Department. It was to launch just after Thanksgiving and it was already the first week of November.  It was estimated and budgeted for at least a months worth of work and I had less than 2 weeks to get it done.  

LazyAss was not accustomed to me being unavailable for his petty day-to-day shit and had nobody else to turn too.  I was the only one who knew how to do his job so he requested upper management to assign him 2 hours of each work day ON TOP of my month-long project.  All so I could do the stuff he should be doing normally that he's too lazy to do.  

I was stressed out beyond belief for those 3 weeks.  Went home every day with splitting headaches and neck problems from being so tense.  We ended up launching the project a week after Thanksgiving (not due to me, but I needed the extra time) but that didn't stop LazyAss from trying to pawn off odd jobs and weekly reports onto me outside of the allotted two hours each day I was assigned to him.  

I've got more stories on LazyAss that I'll share another day.  The thing is, I actually like the guy because he's funny, secures my job position because he speaks well of me in nearly every company meeting, and he gives me free range on company credit to make purchases for anything I need.  I've got the best company computer, best chair, lunch delivered to me twice a week... I totally see through his ruse but damnit... it works on me.  @#$%^@ found my weakness...",2016-01-24 00:03:52
"Client attempts to blame me for problems, my company backs me up. Justice served",81,42cqs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/42cqs1/client_attempts_to_blame_me_for_problems_my/,3,1453583448.0,"My company deals with large volume and we signed on a new client and with it, a bunch of new forms and PDF documents our asset managers have to use.  I'm directly in charge of Reports and Form creation... specifically the PDF's our asset managers and client asset managers use on and off-site.  One of the key functionality requests is that these PDF forms can be filled out from mobile devices.  In fact, its THE #1 reason our clients like us, continue to use us and its why they request we re-create their forms in our PDF format because the Form Fields are so mobile device ready. ** [SEE FORM FIELD EXAMPLE](http://foersom.com/net/HowTo/data/OoPdfFormExample.pdf) of what I'm referring too **  

This new client we signed on has a bitchy client relations manager who doesn't know jack and shit when it comes to technical stuff.  In fact, she's got zero knowledge of forms and electronic paperwork outside of Excel.  She's on the low end of the totem pole and was pretty much handed our account after all the CEO's, Sales Reps, VP's and lawyers from both sides had shook hands and signed contracts.  Having never met her during any of the negotiation meetings nor communicated with her via email, her first request was to make these 6 new forms in Excel.   Wait.. what? 

> ""*I want the form fields to be locked down so the mobile asset manager can't edit any cell but the one they are told to fill in.*""   

I immediately protest as excel spreadsheets are not mobile friendly to use and their Security Protection isn't widely recognized with all apps. Doesn't matter as she's the client and in charge of our account.  She wants it her way because she's unfamiliar with PDF form fields and she uses Excel exclusively in all her other accounts.  

I get all the other VP's, sales reps and CEO involved in this new form development process and they reach out to her to clarify that she wants Excel and not PDF.  They pretty much tell her that there are going to be drawbacks and technical problems in using this format as apposed to PDF.  I'm included in these email conversations and conference calls (mainly because I know these things and they don't) but we told basically that if the client wishes the forms in Excel, she's the client so ""*make it in excel*"".  I spend the next few weeks creating this elaborate multi-page excel spreadsheet for the 6 forms. Each with anywhere from 60-300 form fields (reason why it took so long and testing reasons too).  I lock them down and each form works Perfectly on the PC/Mac version of Microsoft office.  On the one app I used for my tablet, not-so-much. Every Cell could be edited even though the workbook was protected. But, doesn't matter... client wants what they want!   

We send over the 6 excel spreadsheets per exact specifications in the contract (No where does it state that the forms are to be Mobile device protected, just readable and usable which they are) and we wait.  Sure enough, 3 weeks later our VP's and Sales staff get the call that the forms *Don't Work* on mobile devices as requested.  
> *""The on-site asset manager's can edit the fields they aren't supposed too""*.  

My company was prepared for these questions because I told them exactly what was going to happen with functionality.  None of which would have happened had the bitchy client relations manager actually listened to me in the first place and gone with PDF.  

Our company got the full brunt of the clients accusatory blame and a meeting was set up.  Our VP, CEO, Lawyer and myself met up with their main guy in charge to ""fix this"". We handed over all our email conversations, transcripts and contract negotiations that pointed the finger entirely on the bitchy client relations manager.  It showed she was aware of the potential functionality problem, made fully aware that this was going to happen but chose to ignore the issue so she could ""have it in a format I'm familiar with"".  The client rep in the meeting was left speechless.  As a peace token, we handed over the working ""corrected"" PDF's that we had originally talked about and negotiated with.  I had recreated them during the 3 weeks wait for the problem to arise (per CEO's orders).  The entire mess was brought about by one person and our client now knew about it. She was immediately pulled off the account and the new guy is actually good.   

**TL:DR Bitchy Client Relations manager requests forms be created in a format that is not mobile friendly because she's unfamiliar with PDF versatility. She get's her company to blame the entire mobility problems on us. My company backs me up with proof. **",2016-01-23 23:10:48
Rock Factory: The Harry Potter Pizza Party,26,4203dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4203dz/rock_factory_the_harry_potter_pizza_party/,3,1453385170.0,"There's always one guy no one likes. In the rock factory, we have Harry Potter filling that role. Obviously, not the real HP; he just looks like Daniel Radcliffe at about age 12. Fortunately, we're on different shifts now, so I barely have to see him.

It's all well and good to say, ""here's this guy we all don't like"" and just let you all accept that he sucks. So, here's some stories before we get to the pizza story:

- One day, I stayed late to finish up an order. His shift was after mine, so he came in, starts doing his start of shift stuff, but then decides to come over and ""help"" me. Now, I've worked here longer than he has, so this was all really annoying as he told me what I needed to do to set up a job that I already had running perfectly. After his third time coming over to my machine, I finally just take the time to stop and make his little changes so he leaves me alone. The next day at work, the lead in my work area comes in and asks me why I set up so damn weird. The answer, ""To get Harry Potter to leave me the hell alone"" was accepted without question.

- I'm walking back to my work station after preparing up a big old cup of chemicals. I come around a corner, and there's HP, riding a pallet jack, coming straight for me. I react by stepping back, accidentally spilling some of the chemicals on me. He mumbles out ""oh, sorry, man"" as he flies by without stopping. In hindsight, I wish I would've stuck my steel toed boot right under his front wheel.

- When he's setting up a job, he'll ignore the specifications on which parts to use to make sure the setup is done properly. He likes to grab the wrong part because ""it looks better to me if we use this gear instead."" He's the only one who believes that his changes look better.

- He loves trying to fix things himself when the machine breaks. Even though his ""fixes"" have caused hours of downtime, even though we have a dedicated maintenance department whose job it is to fix this stuff, *even though the plant director has told him to stop it*. 

- Recently, he finally got suspended for a day and removed from our high-speed work area. This was because, on a ~3000 piece order, he decided to just sort of Frankenstein the chemicals together without looking at the proper ratios. In the end, the chemical test for the order showed not only were the chemicals wrong, but as the order went on, they stopped even being consistent with each other. 3000 pieces, four different chemical mixes, all of it we had to scrap out.

- Not only did he decide not to use the recipes in our database. One day, we can't get a certain mix right, despite following it perfectly in the recipe. After checking the database, it turns out that about 30 of our most critical mixes had been ""fixed"" by HP in one day. Needless to say, this threw a wrench in production that we're still trying to iron out.

Alright, hopefully you find this guy annoying enough that what I'm about to say will come across as really funny, instead of only really mean. This takes place a while ago; most of the stories I've told didn't happen by this point, but HP was still generally disliked in the factory. He thought he was hot shit, though, and of course decided to try and fill an opening in one of the most brutal positions in the factory - high speed machine operator. On HP's first day, the operator on one of the other lines decides to be a huge troll. The other op walks up and starts talking to him, shooting the shit about how HP's working in the area now. Right before other op goes back to his own machine, he says, ""Damn, with you over here, it's gonna be tough to get that pizza party."" HP frowns, ""Pizza party?"" Other op, in master troll mode, makes up this story about how, every week, the best high speed machine operator and his crew earned a pizza party for themselves.

HP is pumped. Not only does he get to show off how great he is and win something, he also gets a pizza party. That first week, he hit the ground running. While he didn't break any records, he still came in first that week, and was super proud of himself. His smug grin as he saw the performance chart was all too temporary, though. He found the shift supervisor and walked up, feeling like hot shit, and just said, ""So, my line got number one this week."" The supervisor sort of frowns like 'why are you telling me this?' but says, ""yeah, you did, good job!"" HP goes on, ""So, then, uh, how does this pizza party work out?"" The super frowns again and just asks, ""What pizza party?"" It was about then that he finally realized he'd been had.

And of course, management made sure to let him know that he needed to keep those numbers up...",2016-01-21 16:06:10
Homeless Shelter Pops Off in Surprising Way,48,4072jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/4072jw/homeless_shelter_pops_off_in_surprising_way/,5,1452359526.0,"So I just got home from work and need to unload this insanity which is a little long, but I think totally worth it. 

I work at a homeless shelter that serves the most stereotypically homeless folks you can imagine. These are mostly people that have major drug/alcohol addictions or people with heavy mental illnesses and no way for anyone to get any help for them other than a roof over their heads and a hot meal at night so they don't freeze/starve to death. We are lucky enough to have our cities' church congregations let us rotate between their facilities while providing home-cooked meals on an almost nightly basis. Because the buildings are not made to house tons of people in a comfortable way we just throw everyone in the same room, give them a cot and a sleeping bag and once lights-out happens at 10 pm we have to stay awake and monitor them to ensure there are no fights and that no one stops breathing from an overdose, etc...
Two nights ago I came in and was told that there was one guy who was on his last warning about disrespecting staff and would have to leave if he did so again. He seemed fine the entire night other than randomly laughing to himself (which happens, and if the people who do that keep to themselves and don't become too loud it's usually pretty easy to let them do their own thing) until about 2 am when he got up and sat at a table by himself. This wouldn't have been a problem except that he started drumming his fingers on the table loudly and disrupting other people's sleep and was generally being super lame. I went over to ask him to knock it off and he immediately sprung into defensive asshole mode and loudly asked if I had a problem with him, or if I was racist (I'm white, he was black), if I wanted to fight, etc...Luckily for me there was another staff member who is 6'3"" 200 who was able to help me calm him down and ask him to leave. Nothing ended up happening but I was a little on edge and had to work the next night (last night) with not enough sleep.

I came in last night and found I would be working with a new guy who was a shy college student that would be helpful in terms of filling out our paperwork, serving the meals, and checking off their morning chores but was not the type of personality that would be able to help if something major went down. The other guy there was in his mid-50's (we'll call him Jim) but seemed fairly confident in what he was doing and was very friendly and gregarious with most of the residents and had the kind of vibe that told me he'd done this kind of thing before. Right away Jim started to take charge of everything and was delegating our staff responsibilities, helping people set up for bed and generally taking some things off my plate. While I was technically the supervisor because he was just a volunteer, I was more than happy to not have to do quite as much and just sit back and read some super misogynistic James Bond novels. There were two families that had recently lost their homes and he was helping the older kids with their math homework and teasing the little kids and while most everyone turned in early for sleep, the ones that stayed awake seemed generally low-key and I was prepared for the chillest night ever. 

That lasted until about 11pm when Jim took one of the residents (we'll call him Steve) outside to talk about something. Steve is the kind of guy who would have been the stereotypical jock/alpha/douchebag type if he had grown up with a rich family, but instead had spent most of his 28 years on the streets directing his braggadocios-nous outwards in the form of loudly swearing and generally creating ruckus. He's a nice enough guy when he's calm and he doesn't ever attack anyone physically or verbally, but he'll let you know reeeeeeal quick when he thinks something is bullshit with lots of colorful language and a voice that can carry for miles. Jim and Steve come back in after about 15 minutes and Steve goes back to his bed while Jim motions for me to come outside and talk. He lets me know that he caught Steve in the bathroom doing Crystal Meth which is a huge problem because having drugs, alcohol, or weapons is the one sure-fire way to get yourself kicked to the curb. We don't care if you come in intoxicated as long as it doesn't spill over onto anyone else, but doing that in the shelter is a major no-no. I immediately told Jim that Steve would have to go and Jim let me know that he thought Steve was a good guy, that he hadn't actually caught him smoking the meth (just hurriedly shoving the contraband down his pants), and that he had talked to him about God and told him ""Jesus loves you man, and so do I"". Right then I realized that this guy was sort of a hippy-dippy, love everyone and give everyone a chance type of person which was great for patience, but rules is rules and we had to kick Steve out and let the big bosses who run the shelter figure it out tomorrow. Jim kept pushing me to let him stay but I wielded my authority after about 6 tries and he relented. We wens inside and I brought Steve out by myself and told him the deal and he immediately started yelling about Jim having it out for him, that he ""knew all about Jim and the shit he's done"", and that he was innocent and that he didn't do shit, etc, etc...

I've been through this same song and dance about a million times and in this situation the resident will do anything they can to try and stay but I firmly let him know I didn't care and he needed to go. Steve escalated his words against Jim and started saying that he had hit on him and that he was a pedophile (which, dude, you're  almost 30. Maybe he's gay, but why the hell would you call him a pedo unless you don't know the difference?) and I gave him one last chance to get his stuff and leave before I called the cops. He calmed down real quick and pulled out his phone and I told him to hurry up, but he pleaded with me to let him show me one thing before I made him leave. Since it wasn't 2 in the morning like the night before I relented a little if only to placate him and after a minute of typing some stuff he handed me his phone. 

On it was a picture of a disheveled looking Jim, obviously in a mug-shot situation with the words Registered Sex Offender printed underneath. Below that was his offense which read: Continuous Sexual Abuse of Child. I was stunned. Did Steve somehow make this up? I pulled out my phone, quickly googled Jim's full name and the name of our city, and sure enough, the first 2 links were to Sex Offender sites that listed his full name with the same mugshots I had just seen. I stood there for a second as my brain re-booted itself to reality, before the image of Jim laughing and joking with the kids earlier popped into my brain. I rushed inside, shoved my phone in Jim's face and gave him the most disgusted, questioning look I could muster. Immediately his face dropped and he collected his things and left as I shuffled myself in between him and the place where the kids were sleeping. Luckily Steve seemed to understand how pissed and confused I was so he didn't try and confront Jim on his way out the door and create any more trouble. I called my boss and let them know the deal before calling the police and letting them know exactly what had happened. I have no idea what repercussions he will face, but I do know that it freaked me the hell out.

I really loved my job at one point, but eventually, the love of retail fades away. I was getting tired of the shitty pay for everything that I did, so I started looking for a new job.

&nbsp;

I was pretty much sending out my resume to any and every job that wasn't fast food/retail/hospitality. I'm a pretty fast learner and I'm pretty good with computers and people, I feel like I can honestly succeed at anything because failures not an option, and all that.

&nbsp;

There was an ad on my community's website for a Leasing Consultant. Basically, a rental community. Apartments, townhouses, whatever. I was like oh cool, let's just throw my resume into their hat and sure enough I got called in for an interview. Cool beans.

&nbsp;

I go in for my interview and the property manager starts asking the typical questions. We're getting along well and I'm like yaas I am killin' it. Well, then she tells me that she's decided to leave her job. The whole time she's talking about quitting (because she talked to me about it for about 15 minutes, honestly my actual interview was like 5 minutes long), it reminded me of the scene from Office Space where Peter's talking about how he doesn't like his job, and he's just not gonna go anymore. But imagine a woman who looks like a witch (and is, in fact, a fucking witch) saying it with no happiness at all, just completely miserable. She informed me she made her decision on that like 2 minutes prior to me getting there and I was the first person to know (woo?).

&nbsp;

I thought she was a crazy person, honestly, so I was like whatever. Well, she offers me the job and I'm like yeah that's cool. She informs me that she is not leaving after all, has been promoted to corporate offices, and will sometimes come back to our office to help train people and stuff.

&nbsp;

So she was moving on up and considering they will no longer have the ""President Property Manager"" (yeah, they made a title for her because, from what I've heard, just being a ""property manager"" wasn't good enough... [not her actual title btw]) and Property Manager, they had to promote someone to Assistant Property Manager.

&nbsp;

So. That's me being new and this other girl who's been here for 3 years but doesn't shit about what she was promoted to. The Property Manager and this girl used to work together at our sister property. So Assistant Property Manager was transferred to the office that I would be working at.

&nbsp; 

Remember when I said the President was going to be coming to our office to help? The reason that was was because no one had taken their vacations. We were in November and no one had taken their vacations. And the President decides to quit for reals this time. Like, 2 days after I started.

&nbsp;

Ever since then, I have not been trained properly and things that they assume is common sense because they've been doing it forever, is actually not common sense. How am I supposed to know that I'm supposed to write up an acknowledgement for people turning in notices when you're never here to go over protocols with me.

&nbsp;

Did I mention that I've been by myself 75% of the time since I started? Because Assistant Property Manager is always at her old office (which is our sister property), because she cares more about that one cause that's where she worked for 3 years. I understand that, but I never have a manager in my office. I'm not being taught anything and I'm basically just figuring shit out on my own. The few times they've been in there, they will gaslight the shit out of me. ""Well, Property Manager said not to update the status until I have their move in money"" ""No, I did not SAY not to update the status"" Her exact words were: ""Don't put them down on anything until we have all of the money, and then put it in the report"". I took anything as don't fucking put them on anything! I mean...duh? They do this to me every fucking time one or both are in the office. 

&nbsp;

I've been winging it since I started and Assistant Property Manager left me an email last night that really ticked me off. She decided to make a very long list of things that I'm doing ""wrong"". There was a lease that was signed that was missing some initials in some spots. I've been calling that motherfucker for a WEEK to get him to come in and I've been notating every time I call him (we all have to leave notes in a fucking composition book which sure is good for some things, but if you're not even going to go back and read the amount of times I've written that I tried calling, leaving him voicemails and emails, etc. than what is the fucking point of it?) And she had the nerve to say ""There is a lease that was missing spots and it is unacceptable that there was no follow up to him about it"" Bitch, WHAT? And of course, he came in as soon as she called him yesterday when I was off. I've left that motherfucker 4 voicemails and 2 emails, for fucks sakes.

&nbsp;

And then there was ""I noticed there were many notices to vacate this week but I haven't seen or reviewed ANY acknowledgement letters."" What the fuck? I didn't fucking know I had to write acknowledgement letters and I told her EVERY fucking time I got a notice and she NEVER mentioned any kind of acknowledgement letter. I get that she's learning a new job too, but fuck off, lady. And she said that I'm supposed to update the resident cards despite the fact everything we do is logged in the program we use, and if ""the owners were to see that, it would look negatively against you."" FUCK YOU. YOU DIDN'T FUCK TELL ME I HAD TO UPDATE THE GUEST CARDS! ONLY THE SHIT ON THE COMPUTER. FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU. I seriously took this as a fucking threat. If any of the shit going on currently negatively effects anybody, it's dumb and dumber who can't seem to get their shit together. I had no fucking idea I was supposed to update the fucking pieces of paper when everything I do is ONLINE.  Good fucking god.

&nbsp;
            
Simply put, they don't give a shit about my property and my residents. Whenever I see them, it's always ""Oh, sister property would NEVER do that! OUR residents don't act like this!"" etc. It's fucking crazy to me. I get it, President Witch had her way of doing things at this property, and I have a feeling they do this shit with me because I was hired by President Witch. I feel like they're intentionally trying to confuse me and fuck me up because I'm basically what is left over from President Witch.

&nbsp;

I don't want to be a job hopper as I've only been here for a month, but I can't imagine being here for another year, honestly. Whether I quit out of frustration or get fired because I don't ""get it"". I get the job just fine, it's the protocols that I'm struggling with because they have never been explained to me. Instead, I'm left to die in a sea of whale shit.

Come alone.,43,3vb7tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3vb7tp/come_alone/,8,1449168045.0,"I was contracted by a local business to create a logo and a website; my client said that a mutual friend referred me.  We discussed his project over the phone and he agreed to meet me at a local coffee shop to start work after the contract had been signed. 

After receiving the signed contract and deposit, I tried to set up a meeting at our agreed upon location.  He refused to meet at the coffee shop because he said it was too loud.  He insisted that I meet him at his home at noon that day. I offered a variety of other public places – I didn’t know him, have never met him, and as a small female, I definitely did not feel comfortable meeting him by myself in his home (especially since his office was apparently in the basement).  When we couldn’t agree on a location, he asked me to go ahead and get started on the logo. We would try again another day.

I sent the logo for review and, after a couple weeks, I received a response from him.  He demanded that I meet him in his basement at noon that next day (by myself) to discuss the logo and the website.  He (again) refused a variety of public options. I offered to meet him at his home when his wife was home from work and my husband could join us. I offered a Skype call with screen sharing. He refused both.

It had to be at noon. At his home. In his basement. By myself.

After we couldn’t agree on a location, he sent a series of angry emails cancelling the contract and demanding the non-refundable deposit back.  Including this:

> *Client*: ​And yes, my business is too important to me to discuss it in some, nasty, noisy, public, coffee shop…​

And that mutual friend?  I called him the next day and found out that he wasn’t friends with my now ex-client and that he had never actually referred me to him!",2015-12-03 20:40:45

Rude little...,60,3v5kza,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3v5kza/rude_little/,4,1449071762.0,"I worked for a local government in the IT department, but this is not an IT tale.  About 6 months before this episode, a new starter (let's call him Fred) started with us.  Fred was two years out of school and had doubled his salary by joining us.  He was single, living with his parents, and the sudden salary increase meant he was effectively living in luxury.

My wife was taken ill suddenly - one of these strange skin diseases that manifests every other symptom except the one that matters.  She was rushed into hospital and pumped full of antibiotics and was told afterwards that she had come within 30 minutes of having her leg amputated.

My boss was understanding.  He was a new father and the work policies allowed for flexible hours for family emergencies at managers discretion.  He agreed, and I worked from home for half the day after I had collected the children from school.  This lasted five weeks, with the last week being solely being based at home.

She came back home, legs still attached and forever needing to wear compression stockings (super sexy stockings as she calls them) and not being allowed to wear heels or run / play sports.  

Day 1 of a normal working day, and Fred mutters the words...

>... I wish I had a wife and kids so I could work from home when they were ill.

He couldn't understand why I was upset or why the boss had to calm me down.

The happy ending of this is that he manipulated himself into a job role that was cut six months later.",2015-12-02 17:56:02
Stupid Awards,34,3rsimf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3rsimf/stupid_awards/,23,1446833958.0,"I wrote a variation of this for r/fatpeoplestories, but only included the hammy ones in that particular tale. I will condense this one into a bite sized bit of fun for ya'll. Also, to be clear, I worked two jobs when I wrote this. 

Welcome, one and all, to the Awards Ceremony for the Stupidest Questions of the Week! We’ve been enduring the moronic, and let me tell you, the competition is *stiff!*

Let’s get right to the losers who almost made it.

Our first honorable mention is the obese mother of four likewise obese children, who asked, “Do you all have SweetNLow? The soda machine is out of Diet Coke, so I’m just going to make regular Coke diet.”

The second honorable mention goes to this Botanical expert: “Can you tell me what kind of grass is in my yard?"" 

The third, and final, honorable mention goes to evident logician Mr. McTubson, with, “I want six large sides of sweet potato with extra brown sugar and marshmallow. Sweet potatoes are low carb, so it’s healthy, right?”

Third place goes to a comment made by a disgruntled old coot on the telephone Monday morning. “Why can’t ya’ll just fix all my broken shit for free? I paid ya’ll good money for this house 22 years ago and now it looks like crap!”

Second place was taken by Duchess Marlena Brittany Manicure Parker Von Bitchface of Hipsterville-on-Statfordston, nearly tying for first with the gem, “I want, like, everything on your menu for a party, and do you guys like let people borrow your employees so I can have servers?”

First place, though nearly overtaken by Duchess Von Bitchface, was a clear winner, going to Mr. and Mrs. I. B. Trippin, with, “Now, before we pay, we want to make sure that this food has all been blessed by a Catholic priest. Can you confirm this, please?”

Locked Out,47,3rmr2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3rmr2p/locked_out/,10,1446733798.0,"Just had a customer who was a really nice lady. She dropped off some things to be mended and some to be dry cleaned. I told her the total and she was like ""Oh! You want prepayment?"" I said it was preferable if she had it on her. ""I left my wallet in the car, just a moment!"" She comes back a few minutes later with the wallet, but had somehow locked her keys in the car.

I looked up local tow truck places and called the one closest to the shop for her and the guy said he was on the way. She sat in the chair I have up front and we chit chatted a little. She was super nice. ... But then she threw out ""I am just so frustrated, and I know it isn't your fault, but I just can't help it.""

Then the guy showed up and because I am so close to the front of the shop, I hear her chatting with the tow truck guy who is jimmying her car open... ""I know it isn't her fault but...""

... No shit it isn't my fault lady! Come on. You are the one that went into a shop without your money (why?!?!!!) and you are the one that somehow locked the keys in there.

Pay When You Pick Up,50,3q7snk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3q7snk/pay_when_you_pick_up/,8,1445819227.0,"I own a tailor shop. When I first started there 10 years ago as a mere employee, the owner told me that we only did prepay because he had way too many instances of people leaving their stuff with us, then never coming back for it. Meanwhile, he'd have to pay employees to work on it, but then never get paid himself. He had no exceptions and everyone had to pay when they dropped off.

Oh how people complained about it. Most backed off when we mentioned how people never came back for their stuff and how they ruined it for everyone. Some still complained. But the boss never backed down.

A few years later he sold the place and the new owner was mostly the same, but she'd let it slide for new customers who didn't know the policy. We still had some people that would abandon their clothes. We'd try calling them and their numbers wouldn't work. We had some stuff for several YEARS (we had the room to hold onto it). Some would drop off their things and ask for it to be done same/next day (our usual time was 3 days to a week) which incurred an 'urgency fee.' Then they'd come back a week later and say ""Well, I didn't pick it up the next day so I don't want to pay that extra fee!"" as if that was okay.

Anyway, I eventually bought the place. I had to move the shop over a couple doors. Despite advertising, business dropped off by half. So I relaxed the prepay policy even more just to get the work in. Yeah, that was dumb. I think I am going to go back to the way it used to be and only relax it for my few loyal regulars whom I know are good for it.

Right now I have two unpaid for orders that I think are abandoned. The first is 6 pairs of jeans. She came in several weeks ago to ask about my prices. At the time she asked if she left them with me, could her mother (who lives a couple of provinces away) phone in and pay with her credit card over the phone. I said no, that my POS wouldn't allow that (though now I have figured out how to do it, I feel it is too risky) and that I had to have the card present. She was like ""Oh, okay! She is coming for a visit soon, so I will just come in a week before that and drop them off. When I come pick them up she will be with me and can pay for it then. Is that okay?"" I said it wasn't something I liked doing, but that was better than paying over the phone.

Two weeks ago she came in and tried on all the pants (she had to admire her bum in the mirror EACH time) and I pinned them all up. To get my 'jean hem special' they had to be left with me for a week, it was a Friday. The next Wednesday I was preparing garments for sewing when she called up. She said that she was going to be ""going to [province her mom lives in] for good"" and could she possibly pick up her jeans a day early. Since they were cut already and it was easy to add them to the next days work, I said okay. ... She never showed up. So now I have a stack of 6 jeans and I bet I won't see that $47.

The second one I am sure is abandoned is a winter jacket that needed a new zipper. He was just visiting and lives one province over. He brought it in on Tuesday, when I said that it would be ready next Tuesday he said that he was leaving on Monday. I said no problem, I would make sure it was ready on Saturday (I work alone so I am closed Sun/Mon) and told him that I am open from 10 until 3 on Saturdays and it would be ready FIRST THING. New zippers in jackets was a very pricey thing to do under the previous owners. At least $35 for the labour, plus $6 to $10 for the zip itself if you didn't provide your own. I had so many people whinge about the cost that when I took over, I lowered the hoodie and 'easy method' (cutting out the old zipper with a razorblade instead of picking the outside/lining apart, and just putting the new zip on top or underneath) to $19.99 for labour. At least this way I would get -some- money instead of the customer walking out.

Anyway, I told him that if I do this the easy way it would be $19.99 for the labour, and an extra $9.99 because I would have to clip off all of the snap pieces on one side and then replace them because they were in the way. He brought his own zipper. So his total was $31.48. I had to repeat it a few times because he was astonished that it cost 'so much.' Then he said ""Is $30 okay?"" I said no, sorry but we have to pay the GST (man, I am already charging way less than he would have had to pay a couple of years ago!). He was like okay and as I was entering the details of his job into the computer... he walked out. Left the jacket though... so I figured he just thought this was a 'pay at pickup' sort of place.

I got the jacket done a day early...  but couldn't even call his cell 'cause he left before I could ask for the number. So I waited all day on Saturday... and yeah of course he didn't show up. I bet that if he came it would have been at like 4:30 or something and was all pissed that I wasn't open. But because my Saturday hours are different than my weekday hours, I always tell people to make sure they come before 3pm.

So now I am out that $31.48. But in both cases, even though I know the customers are living in other provinces and most likely will not be back... I have to wait 60 days until their items are considered abandoned. Then maybe I can sell them on CL or something.

It is people like that who ruin it for everyone. :C I need to pay my bills too guys. I can't do free work all the time!

___

edit: The guy with the jacket picked up! Strange that he is still in town (it is Thursday now and he was supposed to pick up last Saturday) when he said he was leaving several days ago so that is why I had to do it early. Oh well. I got my $31.50 so I am happy about that!",2015-10-26 02:27:07
No one knows anything?,25,3q77el,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3q77el/no_one_knows_anything/,1,1445810124.0,"So the only identifying thing I will add is that I'm in South Carolina. Since the flooding one of our schools is non-operational and had to be squeezed into another so they can have school as well.

I had been looking for work for two months. ( I am in college but took a year off because my step-father broke his foot and has been out of work. He ran out of sick days and we got behind. I also need to save for a vehicle.) Anyways I searched and got to just about everyone within reason that I could apply to. I finally got an interview at a local school district for janitorial. Well once I got the interview everything went great! She even said there was a full time position open since I made it clear that I REALLY needed full time. She asked me if I wanted part time (at school A) or full time (at school B). So I said ""I really would prefer school B since I need full time!"" She said ""Fantastic well we need to do some paperwork, SLED background, and you need a TB test."" All is well and I go get my TB test and turn it in 3 days later. She takes it and slips it past me at the last moment that she gave away the full time job and is giving me part time working at the ""new"" school location as a temp. So I'm a bit disappointed but go on about my day. Go back to the office, finalize paperwork and was told to start last Thursday. Finally everything clears and I start. Not only has my official boss never heard of me, neither has my unofficial one who is in charge of said ""new school."" So now I'm stuck at a different one (the one mine was merged into) doing different work there until the district manager is back (she just started a week long vacation). So I'm in some limbo where I'm doing a job that wasn't supposed to be mine (floor tech), at a different school than i was supposed to be at,  and am working for someone who had no idea any new employees were coming.

Where quality is job... 8 maybe?,45,3ps74g,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3ps74g/where_quality_is_job_8_maybe/,18,1445527365.0,"This did not seem this long when I typed it up.  Apologies for any errors.

Well this is fun.  I work as a quality auditor at a manufacturing plant in the US.  Basically, I watch people work and tell them they are doing it wrong.  Lately, we have been having a pretty dramatic uptick in warranty replacement for one of our products, like 1 in 5 is coming back not working.  

Obviously, this makes some people in the company a bit edgy.  Specifically, both the president and CEO of the company are alarmed at this issue.  Meetings are had, problems are discussed, and finally it is decided, maybe someone should go to that plant and have a look.

My boss tells me to go over every aspect of [PRODUCT] to see if there is a reason we are having this very specific problem.  Now, our relationship with the managers in this plant are tense at best.  The manager is the son of the owner's best friend in the whole wide world, and 4 generations of this family have been working here since the dawn of time.  

So, as the duly appointed King of the Universe, he doesn't see a real need for things like, specifications, work instructions, measuring equipment, etc.  He has begrudgingly accepted these things into his world, but only after much sturm and drang, and only in very limited quantities.  

All of his minions, sub-minions, and lackeys are in lock step with him on this.  Even those steeped in the traditions of design and engineering, defer to his god-like power and authority.

I make my way into the dragon's lair. My only weapons are a pen and a ream of printed copies of the work instructions, and a faith in ISO:9001 to guide me.  

Now, in all modesty, I know what I'm doing, what I'm looking at, and how it all is supposed to fit.  You aren't going to baffle me with BS to excuse bad practice.  I try to get along with everyone, and I explain to the workers I am not there to get them in trouble, just see how the process is done, and make recommendations to correct bad practice, or bad process.  

However, over the week, I began to see that words like ""practice"" and ""process"" were words for elite, ivory towered, eggheads and here in the real world, shit gets done how we see fit.  

Workers were not inspecting key features, not using the right tools, not testing for proper alignment, or making sure it actually even ran correctly.

So, after a week of observing this process, getting push back from engineers on simple issues, while ducking questions from Manager-God, I am having to write a flowery verse describing these sins in detail without directly implicating M-G, or his holiest of kingdoms.

The write up took several days of rough drafts, amended filings, and tequila to finally submit an audit finding that was bullet-proof, but still doused in enough perfume to cover the smell of crap.

Fast-forward to a meeting had yesterday, RE: The Problem.  M-G is asked point-blank about the issues regarding the audit, and with some deft hand waving, dismisses the entire finding and attributes the problem to a vendor.  Pres. and CEO seem satisfied with that observation, meeting ended.  I wasn't in the meeting, but was stationed outside the meeting just in case, and I swear I heard my boss's jaw hit the table.  

TL;DR - Sent to see why all hell is breaking loose, devil calmly explains why it's the rest of the world not working correctly.

Angry Guy at the Golf Course Chucks a Driver in a Lake,32,3pikds,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3pikds/angry_guy_at_the_golf_course_chucks_a_driver_in_a/,7,1445361358.0,"This story was originally posted in /r/talesfromretail, but they removed it and told me to put it here.

Over the summer, I worked at a local golf course to save up some money before heading off to college. I was a Cart Barn Attendant, so my job was to clean golf carts, handle rental clubs (selling, checking them out, and checking them in), and help customers with other stuff when necessary. Golf is actually a surprisingly stressful game; as a result, customers can actually get pretty angry over little things.

At my course, the washing station for golf carts was really close to the 18th hole. This means that whenever I washed carts, I could see everything that happened on the 18th hole. One day, as I was washing carts, I saw a guy with rental clubs slice his initial drive. He flubbed the next shot too and hit his ball into a sand trap near a water hazard on the 18th hole.

>""FUCK THIS SHIT, I'M DONE!""

He then proceeds to throw the $100 rental driver into the water hazard. When he comes back to return his rental clubs, the driver was obviously missing. I got my boss and he charged him the $100 replacement fee for the driver. The guy protested but my boss didn't budge.

To this day, I'm just grateful that my boss fished the driver out of the water hazard himself. He didn't make me do it and I'm really just happy about that.",2015-10-20 20:15:58

So after giving an apartment away and taking the advertisement down from some list sites, I will still get calls from people asking about the apartment.

Some of them will be people that took down the information but only after several days, have the opportunity to use the information to call several possibilities to see if the apartments are still available.  Usually the calls go like this...

Last night I met a very cheap and shady potential customer for a studio apartment that I'm trying to rent. At the time of the call, I was in a hardware store trying to find the correct applicator pad for a floor wax I have. And I also use my phone for own personal calls, so I tend to try to get the caller to speak first so I can identify if it's personal or business related. It started innocently enough.   
>*the phone rings*  
>**Me:** Hi.    
>**Caller:** Hello.   
>**Me:** Yes?   
>**Caller:** I saw an ad in XXX and is it still available?  
>**Me:** Yes it is. How many people?  
>**Caller:** Two. Can I see it now?   
>**Me:** It's a bit late and I don't live in the building. I can see you tomorrow anytime after 10AM.   
>**Caller:** My wife and I work long hours. She is a hotel rep and I'm a truck driver. Can we please see this tonight? We can be there in twenty minutes.   
>**Me:** There is heavy traffic in the streets due to this rain storm. It may take me thirty or forty minutes to get there.   
>**Caller :** Please, we both want to see the apartment and we don't have time any other day this week.   
>**Me:** Okay. I'll be there in thirty minutes.   

Lucky for both of us, the rain storm and the parking lot disguised as a highway clears up in several minutes. I get to the building within thirty minutes from the hardware store. At the building I notice 2 people standing on the steps. The female is a young Asian, high heel, over the knee length boots and a really tiny tight dress. Geez lady, what type of Hotel Rep are you? The man is a young Spanish looking person dressed in bulk and looks like he's carrying some sort of tool in his inner pocket. His hands are shoved into his pockets and for the meeting he never remove them from his pocket. I decide to call the number and to see if that's them. They call me before I do.   

>**female Caller:** Hi! We are at the building.   
>**Me:** Oh. I'll be there in a few minutes, can you please refresh my memory on who you are?  
>**female Caller:** um. Hold on.   
>**male Caller:** Hello?   
>**Me:**Hi. The lady told me that you two are at the building. I will be there in a few minutes. I'm sorry, Where did you two worked again?  
>**male caller:** We're bartenders at a hotel. We make good money and I can prove everything. Thank you for seeing us so late.   
>**Me:** No problem. Bye.   

I then re-checked the number to make sure it was the same number as before. It was. Oh no. People playing games. So I headed over there and got stopped by a pair of Russians men who read ad and decided to show up out of the blue. I told them to wait a few minutes outside for I had a prior appointment. They told me sure and waited outside as I lead the other two inside. I showed off the place and after some discussion among themselves they wandered back to me.   

>**female:** We like this place. Can we give a deposit to hold this place now?  
>**Me:** It doesn't work like that here. If you are interested, there is an application for $10 and you just need to fill it out and bring it back with proofs of income & ID and a credit report if you have one.   

The woman is stopped by the male and he steps forward while pushing her behind him. The guy tells me a sob story about working for business for many years with no contract or pay stubs and if a job letter would be sufficient. I tell them that I'm not the one who decides or investigates you. ""I would think the more you bring, the better your application will look to the owner and the investigator. So if you have this year's taxes, that should help."" He becomes wary at this point. He looks around himself and tells the woman to stop fidgeting even though she wasn't. She whispers to him that she didn't do this year but she has last year and she has the money for the application. He tells her to be quiet and she meekly follows suit.   

>**Male:** ""Look, maybe there is something we could work out between each other,"" He gestures at the woman, "" That could skip all of this?""  
>**Me:** I have no involvement in the decision making process. I just show the apartment, give out info and collect the fee if they want an application.   
>**Male:** Okay. Can I see the application before I decide to pay for it?  
>**Me:** No.   
>**Male:** Oh come on, work with me here.   
>**Me:** I work for my boss not for you.   
>**Male:** Alright. Then we aren't interested right now. I'll call that number again and try to see the owner.   
>**Me:** And you'll get me. The owner isn't going to waste time unless the applicant is vetted by the investigator and the investigator won't meet with you either.   

The woman at this point tries to say something but she is stopped by the man. They both leave. The Russian pair eye the two walking away and then ask me it's still available. I tell them that I just show the place off and hand out applications for a small fee. I don't decide anything. One of the pair talks to the other in their language and they both decide to check out the apartment. One of them stays behind the other one the entire conversation. He seems to defer to him. The other one tells me that he owns and runs a hotel. He wants a small place to save enough money to buy a house later. He says he can give me all the money now and take this place. I tell him what I told the other pair and he gets a bit angry and asks what else he can provide to help push things further for him over the others. I remind him that I don't decide and just show it. His friend talks to him in their language and he says, ""Okay. I understand your position. I'll go get the money for the application."" As we are leaving he asks how many people are being investigated and I tell him 5. He decides that is too many and tells me that he's not coming back.",2015-10-10 18:29:20

I hadn't thought to post it until now, really.

So I'm behind the counter, where I have the computer and all of its lovely 1980's era software running on a windows 7 machine, and I'm calling to get authorization to do some work for a driver.

When a driver comes in and the company is paying, its policy to call the company, get authorization, the name of who authorized it, and ensure they understand what it is we're about to do so they don't freak out and refuse to pay later because they didn't auth something.

So I'm calling this company, we'll call ""ETC"", and the call goes as follows.

Me: Hi, this is CentralSmith at the (city) (Company), I'm calling to get authorization for some work on truck (number).

Them: Alright, what's your location code?

Now, a location code is a three-digit number our company uses to identify each location. I hadn't know this yet, as I was still in training, so I ask my manager, we'll call ""D"", whom was standing right nearby.

Me: Hey, D, what's our location code for these people?

ETC: What do you mean ""These people""?

Me: Uh...what?

Both D and myself looked completely dumbstruck. Was this person serious?

ETC: You should be careful of what you say. Someone could get offended.

D: Ma'am, I assure you he didn't mean anything by that (We're on speakerphone, is how he heard)

ETC: Well he should be careful what he says.

Me: Uh...

The call was handled by my manager from that point forward, quickly, and with much awkward pausing. To this day I still don't know where the hell that came from - I have no discernible accent, I was being polite and courteous, and my tone didn't come off as offensive at all.

It literally took him 20 minutes to get 100 ft.  He stopped and talked to everyone!  He knew them by name and asked about their kids by name and what school they were in.  I was Blown Away!!  Not only was he a regular guy, but he was one of the best people I have ever met!  I don't even care if he is from So. Philly!

We were doing another MMP with big celebs.  I was told one was coming on.  It pissed me off right away.  I HATE this guy.  He always plays real Creeps, in overly violent movies.  (Not my thing.)
I tell my deckhand, ""Do NOT let him up here!""  (The wheelhouse.)

I answer and turn to look at who I am talking to, and it's this Prick!  Fuuucck!!!  I am all set to be nasty to him, and he just starts talking about the view and how great my job must be.  Couldn't have been nicer or less self absorbed.  We chatted the whole way across.  I was totally turned around on this guy.
Now when I get to the other dock, I have to back in, and gently touch up the stern that is 100 ft away.  He is in awe of the boat work.  I explain it's all pretty basic until the last six inches.  It got real quiet at the mention of the magic words 'Six Inches'  So I made a joke that, ""I'm used to working with six inches.""
He says, Dead seriously, ""That's too bad, I don't have that problem myself."" and walks out.

Mostly Major Motion Picture stuff, but I did do one Bollywood movie.  Anyway, this one time . . . . . . 
We were shooting at the Statue of Liberty.  I was to pick up Major Celeb in NJ.  But first we had to get his 'Forward Person' on board to check out the boat.  This is unusual.  We do a lot of movies, and never had this.  But this guy is easily a top 10 box office Star.
   So, on the boat is my deckhand, and my boss, the owner, (who always shows up for movie shoots,) and me.  We go up to Midtown to get this Fwd person.  Turns out, it's a really cute, late 20s lady.  Super friendly.  She rides in the wheelhouse w/ owner and myself.  Owner is all over her.  She's blowing him off.  I want nothing to do with this.

>""But who is it??""  
>""IDK, I get Tom Selleck a lot.""  (NK, like a lot, I am 6'-4"" and do look a little like him.  My last 3 GFs had me in their phones as Tom, Magnum, and Selleck)

I look my boss right in the eye and tell her, 
>""Yeah, I don't think she was talking about my eyes.""  
He almost fell down the stairs.  She laughed and blushed.  He just yelled, 
>""We are NOT calling you Mr. Big!""
Okay, that was just the first part of the trip.

Then we go down to Jersey City to pick up Mr. Celeb.  He shows up with his 2 kids, like 10 and 12 yrs old.  Okay, that's cool.  As we are backing out, he points up to the buildings in Jersey City and says, 
>""See that kids?  That's NEW YORK CITY.  Where I grew up!""  
I lean over shaking my head, 
>""That's Jersey City, New York is behind us.""  
Guess who kept his mouth shut the rest of the trip?  

So we get to the Statue, and this guy has a 200 ft yacht standing by as his dressing room.  (We were just transportation.)  He goes off to work, and the kids are on board with me.  They are bored and sad.  Clearly these kids have been sheltered their whole lives.  Non-social, the whole bit.  So I try to warm them up a bit.  After about an hour, we are told we have to clear the dock for filming.  So we go stand off a quarter mile.  Waiting waiting waiting.  The kids are climbing the walls.  I feel really bad for them.  
>""Hey kids, want a tour?""  
>""SURE!!""  
So I slowly drift away and head up to the city and show them the Brooklyn Bridge and give some local knowledge and some stories.

Get TF back here!!  NOW!!""  
Now I'm no stranger to trouble, and frankly, Celebs do nothing for me.  I head back and send the kids off.  Several reps come to tell me off, and throw me off the job.  Before they are done, (Celeb) walks in.  
>""Hey man, I just want to thank you for taking care of my kids.  They loved the tour and I appreciate you entertaining them while I work.""

Rock Factory: Effeciency,21,3n0srm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3n0srm/rock_factory_effeciency/,8,1443649631.0,"It's been a bit. I'm still in command of my own assembly line, running the machines with my assistant and QA guy. You may remember that I had some complaints about my old assistant, Onions. My new assistant, however, made me realize that there was even more that Onions could have been screwing up.

To that end, I present three stories about my new assistant, who I'll dub Angelo. Angelo is a pretty cool guy, but some of the stuff he does makes me want to bash my forehead on the table like I'm trying to kill a fly. All three of these stories start in the same spot, which I should point out that not only has a pallet jack specifically for our use, but is also ten feet away from a water fountain.

In fact, that water fountain is a major point of contention in the first story. While preparing the chemical cocktail that was necessary for our rocks, we needed 4oz of water. Since I was setting up the machine, I told Angelo to go get that water. He took the measuring cylinder and started off. I was expecting him to pass back in front of me on his way to the water fountain once he made it around all the machines, but after a few moments I realized that he wasn't going to the fountain right by us. He was off, through our staging area, past the other machines, down the main hall, to the hand sinks by the break room, where he let a small solo stream slowly fill the cylinder. Instead of walking ten feet, he went nearly 200.

Our second story has a couple of similar overtones to the first. In this one, he was sent out to get about 300 pieces of a specific rock. Naturally, the Forklift Guy brings these rocks by before the order actually shows up on our schedule and puts them in the staging area. Angelo knew this. He'd pulled plenty of rocks from the staging area before. On this order, he confidently strolls past the staging area where the appropriate rocks are clearly visible. Walking up to a staging area for a completely different set of machines, he then decides that he needs to go to the warehouse and take them from there. Coincidentally, moments before, the Forklift Guy had set aside a pile of the very quantity of the very rocks that Angelo was looking for, but then had gotten called off to pick something up somewhere else. Angelo drags those rocks 300 feet back to our machines. The Forklift Guy comes by looking for the rocks, and him and I shared a moment reflecting on some of the things that we'd seen Angelo do. Again, he went ten times as far as he needed to, while effectively negating both the work Forklift Guy had done and was trying to do.

The last story happened after I messed up some cobalt rocks, and we needed six boxes of replacements. Naturally, I have my assistant do all the bitch work, and so I send Angelo to the warehouse to procure them. Each box is about 20 pounds, so I was really surprised when he walked off without our pallet jack. More surprising was that, when he came back without any, he felt it necessary to dutifully let me know that there were indeed six more boxes in the warehouse, before finally grabbing the pallet jack and making the trip back a second time to actually grab them. This one was especially baffling considering that we have thousands of these in our warehouse, but in his defense, he only walked twice the distance he had to.

I promised three, but here's a bonus story. In the staging area was a full pallet of rocks, but Angelo just needed to bring about eight boxes of them over to the machines. Since it was a full pallet, though, it was still wrapped all the way - and this particular type of rock was wrapped in every annoying way possible. My approach to the situation would be to pull the pallet over, dispose of the wrapping in the bins by my machine, take the boxes off from the pallet while it's by the machine, and then bring it back to the staging area for the Forklift Guy to take away. Instead, Angelo leaves it in the staging area. First he brings the plastic wrapping 30 feet to our bins, then walks back to the pallet. Then he brings the plastic bands back the 30 feet to our bins, then walks back. He does the same thing with the board on the top of the pallet, then starts carrying the boxes over individually. He literally walked 720 feet when he could have walked sixty.

I could probably come up with another three stories about this guy in the next week. Sometimes, watching him work literally hurts. He's a cool guy, though.",2015-10-01 00:47:11

My manager, who is also the CEO's wife (haha, that's always a bad sign) pushes back and says no, engineers, go manually format this excel sheet. 

Background info: this survey has 222 questions. 

So our engineers do this and deliver. The client is FURIOUS. Why? Because the formatting is completely screwed. Our engineers ( located in India) have an immediate holiday, but the U.S office is open of course and our manager asks me and my team to MANUALLY Format this. 

So I say to her: ""I feel uncomfortable with this task because we are manually hand manipulating data. There are too many opportunities for error"". 

I also am not an excel guru... So touching this excel sheet already freaked me out. Especially with real data from a clients survey. 

My manager, in turn, says I am an insubordinate. 

Which I suppose is technically the nice version of saying ""you do whatever I tell you to, or else""

Yes, because as a survey company we should really be manipulating data anyways. 

Tldr; Work at a survey company, had to manipulate data format, said I was uncomfortable because there are potentially too many errors, gets called an insubordinate.",2015-09-26 06:49:59
Identity theft? Blame the landlord!,48,3l39o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3l39o2/identity_theft_blame_the_landlord/,6,1442351475.0,"I am a landlord. My family owns a small property management company and we manage rental houses for private investors. We're a pretty small operation, and most days I'm the only person in the office so I field all the calls and complaints. Yay! 

Last month an irate gentleman came in to the office waving some sort of fraud paperwork in my face and asking if I remembered him. I didn't. Turns out he was a former tenant who rented from my company about 5 years ago. He then launched into a long and complicated story about how his identity had been stolen by somebody who signed up for a pre-approved credit card in his name. However, the address they used on the credit card application was the address of the house he'd rented from us 5 years ago. So obviously it was my fault. Armed with his fraud letter and a collection of choice 4 letter words, he had come to get me to fix it. 

Still trying to wrap my mind around the problem, I asked him if he'd filed a fraud report with his bank. He said yes, the card had been closed and no money had been stolen because his bank caught it in time. 
""Ok, what are you hoping I can do for you?"" I asked cautiously. Former Tenant replied ""I was HOPING that you would do something to fix this. I thought you would feel some sense of responsibility here. This is my money and YOUR TENANT tried to steal from me! They used the rental address so it has to be the people living there!"" 

Ohhhh, that makes more sense. He thinks the current tenant got some of his mail and applied for the card. I explained that I can't give out tenant information for no reason, but if there was an investigation going on he should have the authorities contact me so I could give them any relevant info. He told me ""There's no investigation because they didn't steal any money, but I know it's them. You have to do something. They can't just go around taking things from people like that! What are you going to do about it?! This is your company and you're letting them get away with this?"" Oh lordy. He's loud and angry and I have no idea how to help him, so I finally said ""I'm not really sure what I can do to help you. I could call the tenants and ask if they'd received any of your mail, but if they did try to steal your identity they wouldn't just admit to it. Honestly, this seems like more of a civil issue that doesn't really involve us. I'd need some kind of proof before I could take any action on my end.” 
Wrong move. 

He starts going off on “What do you mean you don't know how to help me?! Of course this #&$*%(^&# involves you! It's your company! Just deal with the *&%#$@(%* tenants or I'm going to call the police!” Any time he pauses for breath I just keep interjecting “I'm not sure how to help you. Let me talk to the property manager when she comes in and we'll figure out what we can do.” After about a half hour of back and forth he finally realizes I legitimately don't know what to do, so he leaves after a few passive-aggressive parting shots about how I should feel bad that my company is screwing innocent people over. 

Once he leaves, I look up the tenant information and find there's only been 1 tenant in the house since he moved out 5 years ago. Since the fraud happened only a couple weeks ago, it's not terribly likely that his mail was still going to the rental address, but who knows. He came in the next day and we went through almost exactly the same exchange again. I told him we needed proof because I can't just evict somebody on hearsay. In the meantime, if he wanted to contact the police we'd be happy to provide any information they needed. Finally the property manager got time to talk to him, and told him the same things I'd been saying all along. 

He was not a happy camper, but seriously, what did he expect me to do? 

TL;DR Angry guy thinks my tenant stole his identity. Has no proof, but wants me to evict said tenant on his word. I can't; he gets angrier. ",2015-09-16 00:11:15
Tales from the tanning salon.,39,3keug7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3keug7/tales_from_the_tanning_salon/,5,1441898880.0,"This guy came in one night. He's a regular with a shitty car. His girlfriend comes in sometimes. They always refuse to buy tanning lotion.


Well this guy has one of the highest memberships. $110/month. It allows him to use all of the tanning beds as well as all of the spray tan machines. He also pays his memberships with gift cards. I'm pretty sure he was some sort of scammer.


Anyways, one night he comes in, requests and extra towel and the same bed he always uses to tan ""because it has the loudest stereo."" If warning bells are going off for you, good.


I have to preface this a bit. Our radio in the stores sucked. They were terrible. And the way the walls were built, they didn't go all the way to the ceiling. The only rooms that had drop ceilings were the bathrooms, laundry room, and spray tan rooms, so if someone turns the room speaker up too loud, the entire store can hear it, even over the fans on the tanning beds. The machine involve in this story has an Aux input cable built into it so you don't have to listen to our shitty taste in music.


Well, I send this dude on his way and he starts the bed. Within the first 30 seconds of him being in the bed, his phone is hooked up, with both the device and bed volumes turned ALL. THE. WAY. UP. For 12 minutes, I had to listen to a mixture of Nickleback and Kidd Rock while this asshole tanned.


Thankfully, he leaves after what feels like an eternity and I go to clean the bed after I finish up some other nightly duties. Now, some people just sweat a lot. It's not a big deal. Every tanning salon I've worked at uses medical grade sanitizer to clean the acrylic. This dude happened to sweat a lot and I noticed the puddle first. Then I notice the towels. I fucking hate folding towels. I especially hate it when (most) people request extra towels.


Then... There it is. A small black bottle, probably 2 ounce capacity. I pick it up and read it. ""Personal lubricant.""


Of course I freak out, clean the bed SUPER WELL, and leave a note on the system to let others know.


Also, that shit is bad for the acrylic in the beds. We're talking about a piece of equipment that costs, used, AT LEAST $17k.


Lesson from this? Please don't masturbate in a tanning bed. You'll fuck up your tan lines.",2015-09-10 18:28:00

No problem. I look up the account on her slip, and then go to related accounts. She has 2 standard chequing, and one interest chequing.

A good part of my job is printing reports for people in my department and other departments to use.  When I arrive at work, it's basically the first thing I do - print reports and place them in the file cubby thing so people can take them whenever they need it.  However, if we are a bit more busy than usual, Boss will come in a little earlier and print out some of the reports.  I still don't understand why she does this, it just takes away stuff for me to do.  

This past weekend was one such busy weekend.  I walk into work this morning and glance at the file cubby across the room.  Looks like there's one report dangling from the cubby.  I sit down and start printing reports.  When I'm halfway done, the other supervisor walks up to my desk and tells me that Boss has already printed the reports from the weekend.  Boss's desk is two feet away from my desk.  She is just sitting there staring at her monitor.  Not saying a word.  I walk over to the file cubby and grab that one dangling report.  It is about one-fifth of all the completed reports.  I put on my best calm face, and walk over to her desk, ""Hey Boss, do you have the other reports too or should I print them out?""  She looks up at me as if she didn't hear a word of my and other supervisor's discussion and tells me, ""Oh, I printed some of the reports, here you go.""  And she hands me about another three-fifths of the reports.  I look through them and per usual she has formatted them incorrectly and highlighted the wrong things.  Through my sigh I ask her for the remaining reports.  She replies, ""Oh I got busy, so you can print the rest.""


FFFfffffffff!


A small problem with the reports is that you look them up through batches and print them with batches.  It's much more efficient if I just sit and print them all at once.

Idiot Backyard Breeder almost kills his only surviving pup--- UGH!!!,68,3i9vu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3i9vu5/idiot_backyard_breeder_almost_kills_his_only/,19,1440464379.0,"I’ve never felt the need to share my experiences online. But I’m still so baffled and appalled by this asshat. 
I work reception at a small veterinary clinic in North America, and paperwork aside- I really do enjoy my job, my co-workers, and our regular clients. I’m super bubbly, easy to work with, and eager to make a customer happy—but this guy… I literally can’t say anything civil about.


Background before the start of my shift: 
A family calls at 8:00am sharp (opening hour) with an emergency situation. My co-worker pulls up the file, and a BIG RED pop-up alerts her that these clients once owed us $400+, and it took several months of reminders and stern phone conversations to actually get them to pay us the full amount. 
So that’s a warm fuzzy…


The owner (who will now be referred to as O) explains over the phone that her dog has been in labor since 5pm last night, and needs to be seen by a vet. My co-worker immediately adds her to the schedule and tells her to head straight for our clinic, as this is considered life threatening. My manager makes up an estimate for an emergency C-section, and the techs in back begin prepping for an unscheduled, intensive surgery. Minutes go by and O’s arrive (teen daughter and mother) along with a tiny, terrier-mix, dog. In the O’s defence (hardly…) the dog seemed very alert and responsive, even after being in labor for 15+ hours. My techs asked if the O had called the veterinary emergency hospital, after they noticed no puppies were passing from labor. 


O said yes, she called at 3 a.m. and they told her to wait until morning. (We work VERY closely with the emerge clinic, and we are certain this is a lie. They would have told her to come in immediately. Our theory is: being a 24hr clinic, emerge is expensive and they didn’t want to pay for this. So they instead decided to risk waiting until morning for a general practice to open.)


 My manager didn’t press the matter and showed her the estimate and began to go over the procedure my doctor would be performing to save their dog, and hopefully the puppies. My manager also asked for a deposit, as it was an emergency, walk-in surgery.

 
O was appalled at the price and the request for a deposit. The emergency C-Section with full IV fluids, monitoring, medication, and pain management ranged from $1700-2300. (It’s a lot—I get it, I really do. I can’t afford a pet myself, and try to sympathise as best I can with clients. But people, you gotta think before getting a pet—let alone BREEDING ONE!) The O proceeds to spew insults at my manager, how we’re “all about the money,” how we “don’t really care about the animals,” etc etc…


My manager tells O there is nothing she can do—they can either decide as a family to surrender the pet (at no charge) so we can begin surgery and providing care, or they have to pay for their pet’s medical needs.
O threatens to leave, and my manager tells her very clearly that if she leaves without providing care for her animal (care the animal needs because the O stupidly tried to breed the poor thing, and then let the dog suffer through 15+ hrs of labor!!!) that she would report the O for negligence. The dog was lucky to still be alive.


O bitches some more—pays the deposit of $1700 (the very LOW end of the estimate) and storms out of the clinic.
I arrive and get filled in on the situation, while my doctor is in back performing surgery. My doctor had all hands on deck- we had to cancel appointments, and the doctor had to call her husband into clinic to assist in resuscitating puppies.


X-rays show 5 puppies; one stuck in the birthing canal. (Turns out the O bred her small female with a larger male, as the puppies’ heads were 30mm in diameter, and the birthing canal’s opening was only 25mm wide….. well done Back-yard Breeder.) 


After several minutes of surgically opening the dog- my doctor discovers the uterus has essentially collapsed, has had blood circulation cut off, and was slowly dying/spilling out—along with the 5 puppies inside. She removed the entire uterus, and the second doctor along with her technicians had to take over with the puppies, while my first doctor continued trying to save the mother. 


I’m manning phones, and the front desk- checking in back, desperately wishing I could help. Both technicians, a fellow receptionist, the second doctor, and the first doctor’s husband, each have a puppy they are desperately trying to resuscitate. I get called over to prep epinephrine, after 45 minutes of little to no signs of life. 
Roughly 2 hours pass—doctor one is still in surgery saving the mother, and only one puppy is barely showing signs of life. Finally after another 10-15 minutes, the staff rejoices to hear the angry squeaks and whimpers from the only surviving puppy, finally breathing on her own. My first doctor manages to save the mother as well—we get her all sutured up, and before long she is set into a blanketed kennel with her new pup, who is eagerly nursing. 
The day continues fairly normally, aside for the occasional angry squeaks from the new born puppy learning to suckle.


My doctor calls O’s and tells them both the tragic, and heartwarming news. We tell O that we will monitor through the day and the dog and pup could go home around 5 p.m. 
Later my doctor tries to call O after the bill has been finalized, but gets no answer. There is a remaining balance of approximately $400 (as they only paid the low end of the estimate).


5 p.m. rolls around and daughter comes in to pick up her dog and pup. We explain the remaining balance, and she is surprised. She tells us her mom never got the message and would be very upset. Instead of getting her mom from the parking lot (who is still irate and infuriated with us), she calls her dad to pick up the dogs after he finishes work at 6 p.m. The daughter tells my manager her father would pay upon pick up.


6 p.m. rolls around, and I’m at the till typing notes. A gentleman walks in, and I smile and greet him, “I’ll be right with you sir, I’ll just be a second.” 

He steps to the side of the counter, and I manage to hit 4 keys before he puts his hands down and says abruptly, “Nope. Nope- no, I’m here for my dog.” He begins to walk behind the counter—

Shocked, I stammer, “Sir—sir? Sir please stop—,”
“No—I need to get my dog.” He proceeds past my counter into our treatment room.

I follow, “Sir, I need you to stop- is there something I can help you with?? Sir--!” My manager looks up at me, shocked- my two doctors, holding a loose cat for vaccines, are frozen in shock as well. 

“What’s going on?” my manager asks.

“I- I don’t know—he won’t stop--,”

My manager dismisses me to return up front. I glance back and see him opening the dog’s kennel, and my two doctors racing to stop him. I close the door to the back treatment room and try to regain my composure. I hear yelling, mumbled words, more yelling, and then my heart stops as I hear the most pitiful squeak---


I begin to panic, not knowing what to do—I turn to see my manager escorting him off the property, with a box in his arms and some towels. 
I dash in back to see my doctor in tears, and my staff completely shell-shocked. I cautiously asked what happened, and my doctor tells me: the gentleman marched back into the kennel room, ignored orders to stop what he was doing—lifted the dog and towels out of the kennel (almost ripping her sutures out) and in doing so—he had dropped the new born pup from almost 4ft high… (That had been the terrifying squeak I had heard while up front….)


Thankfully, my doctor caught the pup, before she died on impact—but he proceeded to call my doctor a “butcher,” and tell her how she murdered his puppies and maimed his dog, and how she and all of her staff were despicable low-lives and degenerates only interested in money… 


I’m still in shock—this is a first for our clinic, and we now have a new policy in place to immediately call 911 if EVER anyone enters treatment against an employee’s word… But we still haven’t been fully paid… and we have NO idea if the puppy is even alive still… The O’s are being sent to collections next week.
I’ve never felt so stupid and helpless and infuriated.


Please: SPAY and NEUTER you pets- there are dogs and puppies in shelters, we don’t need anymore! DON’T be STUPID backyard breeders. DON’T wait 15+hrs after labor to seek veterinary help. And DON’T almost murder a new born pup (that took 3 hrs to save) through ignorant actions!!! Don’t be an idiot--- or at least, if you’re going to be an idiot, DON’T OWN PETS!!! Ugh…

Curtain Guy,27,3hksqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3hksqn/curtain_guy/,7,1439987909.0,"(x-posted from /u/TailesFromRetail 'cause I didn't know about this sub till just now...)

This happened last year at the tailor shop that I now own.

An old man brought in about 8 panels sheer drapes (the worst kind) he started right out by telling me all about how he used to make drapes for a living, but had sold his sewing machine years ago and that was why he was coming to me or else he would totally be doing this by himself.

There was about 75ft of width between many, many panels. At the time, I hadn't yet started charging per panel, but by the previous owners metric of 'per foot in width.' I have learned that when you say any price followed by 'per foot' the customer starts panicking about what the cost -might- be and it is safer to say 'per panel.' The most time consuming part of hemming drapes is getting them all laid out and measured accurately which is what most of the cost is for. The actual sewing of the hem is really fast and easy in comparison... and sadly, the only part that the customers actually think about when they want to get them hemmed. 'It is so easy, you just sew straight across!' is what many people think.

He was in a hurry after telling his story and didn't want to stand around while I measured this massive pile of fabric. I said, ""How about I measure it after you've gone, figure out the price and give you a phone call to let you know how much it would cost. Then you can can decide if you want to go ahead with it or not. I wouldn't do anything until you've made your choice."" The dry cleaner I work with does this a lot. Their customer brings them a mending/alteration job and they send it along to me with a 'call with price' note and then I can call the customer to say what it would be and if they want me to do it or just send it back.

He said that seemed okay... and then said, ""So what would it be in the ballpark of? Like thirty dollars?"" ... THIRTY DOLLARS? Are you freaking kidding me? It took all I had not to laugh in his face. I told him no... typically for sheer drapes the cost has always been $5.99 per foot in width. Sheer fabric is a little more difficult to work with both to measure/mark accurately and to sew without snagging/bunching so it gets the highest price. However, I would be willing to give him the price for unlined drapes ($3.99/ft) since he had so much and people like hearing that they are getting a deal.

His eyes bugged out of his skull. He couldn't believe it. ""People actually pay that much?!"" Yes they do. ""But all you have to do is fold it up to here (he points) and sew it across. Thankfully his drapes were already cut, they just needed to be folded up 1/2"" then again by 1.25"" and sewn across. I had no other customer at the time so he kept going on and on about how I was charging sooooooo much.

I was such a push over. I told him that since the case was such that I wouldn't have to spend all that extra time measuring and cutting, that I would just charge him for my time (to think of price for things, the original owner -aka master tailor- said that you should charge $1 for every minute you had to spend on something... I didn't tell the customer the scale by which I determined price) so the price would be more like $50, take it or leave it. He begrudgingly decided to give me his information. He then said that he didn't want to pay until he picked up just incase I ""screwed it up"" because how could he know if I'd do a good job or not!

I sucked it up and said fine, then if next week was good for pick up (I like asking one week turnaround so I can schedule things nicely) but no no no, he had to have it on Friday (it was currently Tuesday). I figured I'd have time to squeak it in if I came in extra early one morning and I just wanted him to leave so I said okay.

I did those damned drapes. Even added little weights to each one at the two bottom corners like sheers should have so they don't flap wildly in the breeze (these didn't originally have them since he cut them himself and probably lost them). I pressed the hems ONLY since that has always been shop practice plus there is no space to press the entirety of drapes, folded them neatly and had them ready to go at 9:30 Friday morning. I even adjusted the price as I input it into the computer to be exactly $50 after GST even though it had taken about 60 minutes... just 'cause I didn't want him to whinge that I had quoted him $50 so why is it now higher?

He showed up the next Wed/Thurs or something like that. Asked if I had pressed all the wrinkles out (he had brought them to me all balled up in a garbage bag) so I said that I did my best and even weighted them. ""Well good, you are supposed to do that."" I bit my tongue and asked for the $50. He pointed at a sign in my window and I cringed. ""I dropped these off on a Tuesday. Your sign says 10% off for seniors on Tuesday. Did you apply that?"" ... No. Not only does the sign also state that you must give me one week and you demanded them to be ready in 3 days, which they were even if you didn't come for them, but I had pretty much already discounted between $250 and $400 on these things. I told him how much of a discount he was getting too.

He angrily shoved his credit card at me ""I can't believe you are robbing people like this!!!"" Yeah, well you didn't have to choose to get them done by me. Payment goes through and I put his receipt in the bag and wish him a great afternoon. He snatches the bag and marches out while grumbling ""I am never coming here again!""

... And I never saw him again. Also, I kept an eye on my bank in case he decided to be a dick and reverse the charge, which he didn't thank goodness.

Lesson learned. I am not such a pushover now. Guys like him can go hang. I am desperate for work, but not that much.",2015-08-19 15:38:29

Thankfully, IT has given us a dummy program a month in advance so we can start getting used to the functions.  Once I get it on my computer, I close reddit and start clicking around, because hark! Something to do!  It's a pretty neat program, they condensed a lot of options together and made things efficient.  This is what I do for the rest of the day.

I looked down at the driver and he is trying to hide the fact that he is on his cell phone.

> Me: ""I would say maybe half an hour and he will be done unloading""

after I hung up I called another operator over who has more experience than me to finish the job.
I wanted to snap at the driver but decided to kill him with kindness. with a big smile I walked over to him

not a big deal, but big enough to call your dispatch to complain about me?

Just dealt with a Very Rude customer,36,3guu3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3guu3j/just_dealt_with_a_very_rude_customer/,21,1439478036.0,"I don't know if this is the best /r/ for me to post this in, it seemed fitting to me though.

Background: I'm a receptionist at the service department of *Car Dealership*. I answer phone calls and make appointments. Anything complicated I usually just send over to one of my Service Advisors.

Phone Call: A woman calls asking about an Urgent Recall notice that we send out whenever someone has a recall on their car and doesn't bring it in. First she starts off with saying she never got the first notice. I'm still a little bit knotted up about this so I'm not going to format this in dialogue, just going to summarize it.

Basically, what happens is sometimes the HQ of *Car Dealership* prints out old information that no longer applies to certain customers. The place I work at is privately owned. Although we work with the HQ, we are NOT the HQ. We do not control the printing of information. The recall notices are sent out based on that information.

This woman, as it turned out, no longer owned the car that this notice is for. So, just as I tell every other customer that has this issue, I told her that she can disregard this notice. She then continues to question why we had sent out this card with wrong information on it (as it is handwritten). I say, just like always, we do not control the information being printed. I then offer her a number to HQ to get her name and no-longer owned car off the list.

She then begins to chew me out, asking me if we'll pay her to do that (sarcastically) because it's ""our job"" to handle whether she's on the list or not. I keep trying to insist that it's simply not my job to call HQ about it. I do what I'm told, I'm just the f*cking receptionist.

Then she continues to say ""I've been working in sales for years"" and goes on and on about how *Car Dealership* is acting like a herd of sheep, and not the ""leader"". Which, is literally what we are. We're not a leader business, we literally follow guidelines and rules from HQ.

She continued to berate me and chew me out for something that is not in my control, repeating the same lines she was using earlier. She finally decided to hang up, but not before telling me ""Actually, I think I WILL call HQ. Have a nice day.""

I was so frustrated and angry that I started crying. This is something that happens to me, not necessarily because I'm sad. Whenever I get an overflow of any emotion, I cry. But I'm at work (even while typing this) and I can't cry on the job. So I ran to the bathroom. My stomach is still in knots over this.

I really don't like working with people, I belong with animals working with them. I want to be a dog trainer. This job is out of necessity and I have to deal with it, obviously. I needed to vent about this, I'm still really upset. Sorry if something doesn't make sense or if this is sloppy.",2015-08-13 18:00:36
Seriously...over some tire shine?,30,3g8e70,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3g8e70/seriouslyover_some_tire_shine/,5,1439031074.0,"EDIT: Please read entire story, i assure you it's worth it. :)



So i work at a car wash and it's not uncommon to have to deal with rude/irate customers. 
So this lady comes to the car wash, she had her son and his friend in the car. They go through the wash (touchless auto wash) and about ten minutes after she went through, she comes up to me and asks for some tire shine. 
I asked her to show me her receipt, she didnt have one and didnt ask for one when she should have either. So i looked at her tires and they were bone dry (the tire shine is applied automatically albeit liberally in the car wash tunnel) and i told her i could not give her tire shine without proof of purchase. 
(That's the company policy and i uphold it because my management is very strict, and i didn't want to have to deal with any disciplinary consequences.)
She gets uppity and starts cursing at me blah blah blah. She calls her son over to ""verify"" her purchase. After i said once more she wouldn't be getting tire shine, and stated that it really wasn't that big of a deal for her to be making such a scene over something so insignificant. Her son said ""if it's not a big deal, then why not give her some tire shine?"" 
(I would have completely ignored her son if he hadn't taken a step towards me in a ""threatening"" manner while he said it.) At this point i realized this 16-18 y/o kid was ""out for blood"" so i told him point blank ""don't step to me like that."" Of course that sends him over the edge and reaches in his pocket and pulls out...



his wallet, and throws it on the hood of my car. I replied to this indignant action by saying ""don't throw your shit on my car."" 
So now i knew this kid was about to do something stupid.
Sure enough, he winds all the way up movie style (twisted his hips and shoulders, all that) and punched me in the face... I had to consciously think about what to do next, and then it hit me. (pun intended?...) i turned my head back to face him and laughed! 
Then i asked him and his mom and little friend to leave the property and not come back. (They left pretty quickly surprisingly, still huffing and puffing.)


I was shocked that he punched me in the face over some tire shine...come on now really? 
If all that wasn't enough...he punched like a BITCH! I literally have been hit harder by my ten month old daughter. And i promise i am not exaggerating in the slightest bit.",2015-08-08 13:51:14
Closing time and safety do not matter to him,24,3g5f9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3g5f9t/closing_time_and_safety_do_not_matter_to_him/,5,1438968188.0,"Forgive me if this is the wrong place for this story. If there is a more specific place to post, do let me know and I will take it there!

So, I work at a funeral home. It's a wonderful job and I really love where I work. We do a lot to take care of families in a way that the other funeral businesses in our area don't. For example, we own our cemetery and it's on the same property as our office. Great place for people who don't go to church to be buried. But anyway, this is about the cemetery. Our office and cemetery close at 8pm everyday. It sucks, but it's what we have to do. I'll be the first to tell you that people don't care about others and their loved ones' graves. I've seen jerks drive over graves in their car and leave tire marks without a care in the world.  If you leave cute little trinkets out, they're going to get stolen. So, we lock up when the closing staff leaves because we don't want someone's stuff getting ruined in the night, when we have no one to watch over everything. 

It's 8:30pm, a whole half hour after I was supposed to close. I had done my drive around the cemetery to find people visiting and let them know I would be closing the gates. We have two separate gates; one for entering and one, with a stop sign, for leaving. The last family is waiting to pull out, our entrance gate is locked, and I am standing literally right next to the exit gate when Mr. ""I know you're locking up but I need to visit this person right this very second"" pulls in at a speed higher than necessary through our exit, nearly hitting both the family trying to leave and little old me in the process. I got back in my car to go politely ask him to leave. Of course, when I found him he was at the grave talking to his loved one, so I let him be for the good two minutes he was there. 

Two. Minutes.

Maybe this was his only chance to visit, maybe he had driven clear across the country (we get a lot of those people trying to visit when we're trying to close), who knows. But, was that two minutes really worth nearly causing a big fat accident? 

Why don't people check when places close and plan accordingly? Why don't people use their context clues and decide that maybe right now is not the right time to visit?

This has backfired.  

Last week we had a discussion on using envelopes for the end of day cash out. They are against them, I am arguing for them. 

I need them to keep the receipts in, if we had multiple tills, then I see a reason. But we don't.

They argue that we can just use rubber bands for the receipts. 

I argue that they don't last, and we have to keep them for 7 years.

I thought that was the end of it. I came back today with rubber bands on my desk, and cash outs in cases. I'm putting the receipts in envelopes. I refuse to use the rubber bands.

L also is trying to get into wholesale. What you need to know about L is that they have no prior retail experience, or any business education. Multiple times I have asked L how we are going to invoice these potential clients, and how they will be paying. L has had no answer for me. 

We have already gained a wholesale client, and apparently we charge based on what they have sold. But they have no way of actually tracking this. So they just gave us a random amount of cash. L sees no problem with this.

My anxiety is through the roof, I'm having panic attacks daily because of this job. And it's L's fault.

Rock Factory VII: Leather,15,3f7msu,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3f7msu/rock_factory_vii_leather/,0,1438291979.0,"This might go without saying, but I pick up a lot of rocks at the Rock Factory. Sometimes six thousand a shift. Sometimes eight tons a shift. Even though I'm a machine operator, I definitely work with my hands, and it shows in the various cuts, blisters, and callouses that I end up with. This is the story of how one of those callouses became a pretty gross practical joke on Redwood, my direct supervisor.

I originally got a blister five days before this story's events. I didn't pop it, so it ended up just forming a huge callous over the area that wasn't actually attached to the skin underneath, and I'd managed not to tear it up until this particular day. Sadly, one edge finally started to tear, and I ripped most of it off in one piece. I was just about to throw it away when I realized that I still owed Redwood a prank from something he'd done a while ago. Instead of tossing it, I put it on a corner of my desk.

Much later in the day, Redwood comes over. In this stage of our industrial process, I was finishing calibrating the machine, and needed to measure the output and show it to Redwood for approval. I run the machine and set the prototype down, turn around to grab a ruler, and when I turn around he's already looking at the quality of it. This is sort of annoying to me, because we need to measure the position before we worry about the parts of it that Red is checking.

""Can I see that rock real quick?"" I ask him. He just ignores me, looking at the rock. I can tell by the way that he's ignoring me that he's just messing with me, but I give him a few seconds to bask before I tell him, ""Give me that rock."" He just still keeps ignoring me. No smile or anything. Usually the third time, he'll break, so I yell, ""For fucks sake, will you give me that goddamn rock!?"" Still nothing... and then I remember what's on my desk.

I turn around and grab it, and he sets down the rock. Too late for me to call of retribution. Holding my skinflake in my fingers in a clear ""hold out your hand and accept this"" gesture while shielding it from view, I kept my gaze focused on my hand. ""What's that?"" he asks, and I ignore him. He sticks out his hand, palm up, and accepts it. ""What IS that?"" he asks, inspecting it closer. I grin and show him my [thumb](http://i.imgur.com/T1wi7of.jpg). He quickly puts the pieces together in his mind.

His reaction is priceless, and made me really appreciate how close the emotional response to fear and to being grossed out are. Even though he was just holding it in his fingers, he brings both of his hands back over his shoulders, as well as taking a step back. He managed to even throw it in the trash can. He says something about how much he hates me, then we all laugh about it. Someone tells a related story, and the rest of the shift goes on.

Although that's where this story ends, something happened later that I think might be coming up in a future episode. While Redwood was talking about some future roster changes, he told me one that would affect my line that I did not like. See, Onions figured his shit out and got on Adderall, and now I truly think that he's the best assistant floating around. I'd known that personnel were going to be shifting in the near future and was hoping to snag him for my line. However, Redwood told me that it was not to be; I would be keeping my current assistant. I could write an entire post about how much I hate working with the guy (although honestly, he's a really cool dude I have no personal problems with), but instead I'll have to promise that I'll soon be writing about my process to weed him out - ASSUMING that Redwood wasn't trying to prank me when he told me that I wasn't getting Onions. But that is for a future tale from the Rock Factory.",2015-07-31 00:32:59
Do you want me to think you're stealing your husband's money? [Long rant],22,3f7jf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3f7jf6/do_you_want_me_to_think_youre_stealing_your/,13,1438290569.0,"LONG RANT POST.

Woman in the drive-thru wanted to cash her husband's pay cheque. That's fine, did you sign the back of it also? She said no, so I send it back out (I didn't even take it out of the tube at this point), and then carry on when she sent it back.    
Cheque is made out to John, but only Jane has signed that back of it. Go back over, ask if John is in the car, and then the attitude starts.

J: ""No, he's out of town, at work.""    
Me: ""Ok, well I can't cash this without his signature also, so-""    
J: ""I'm his WIFE!""    
Me: ""I understand, but he has to sign it also to cash it. I can-""    
J: ""Well, just deposit it then. We have a joint account.""

Ok, I was going to suggest that. So, using her debit card, I look her up. The accounts on her debit card are only in her name, but they have a second set of accounts in both. I deposit the cheque, send the receipt, and carry on.

Fast forward to an hour later. I call the next customer to my window, and guess who it is?

J: ""You waited on me in the drive-up, and you put the money in the wrong account!""    
Me: ""I'm sorry?""    
J: ""I told you to deposit the money into my debit card account, and you didn't! I have bills coming out, and now because of YOU, I can't pay them!""    
I look up her account, and..   
Me: ""I deposited it into your joint account?""    
J: ""NO! You put it in the wrong one. I TOLD you to put it on my debit card. You can't just change the account without notifying me.""    
Me: ""The account for your card isn't a joint account.""    
J: ""YES IT IS. I GOT HIS NAME ADDED.""    
Me: ""Legal title: Jane Doe.""    
J: ""Yes, that's me! And John Doe is on there too!""    
Me: ""No he isn't.""

We went back and forth a bit before I finally convinced her that, no, he hadn't been added to the account.

J: ""Well, I'm still his wife. You should've just put it in the account I told you. Now I'm going to be overdrawn when my bill hits this evening! What are YOU going to do about it?""    
Me: ""Well, since it was a cheque, it wouldn't be available until tomorrow anyway. Any bill removed tonight would overdraw your account any way. I can't reverse it anymore, since you waited an hour to come in, and I can't withdraw it since the money isn't in your account yet.""         
J: ""WE COULD'VE AVOIDED ALL THIS IF YOU JUST PUT IT IN MY ACCOUNT.""

By now, I'm irritated, and a line is forming.

Me: ""You're right; I could have. Then your bills would've come out, probably leaving you with a few hundred in the account. Then maybe you would've used your debit card for groceries and shopping. So, now you have about a hundred or so in your account. Then, the back room would've looked at the transaction, and noticed that John Doe's cheque never went into an account for John Doe. They don't know if you're his wife, or if you're a relative who stole his cheque. So they're going to say ""this was never Jane's money, we need to return a copy of the cheque so John can have his money."" And the money for that cheque will be taken from your account. And they won't call you, and they won't care you're now overdrawn. And it'll be a week or more before that cheque is delivered.""

At this point she's kind of shrunk a little in size.

Me: ""SO! Since I deposited the money into an account with his name on it, you can just go ahead tomorrow and transfer it over into your billing account. And we won't have to worry about you losing all this money a few weeks from now, when the back room decides you have no right to it.""

End of the long story, she is suddenly as nice as pie, thanks me for explaining it to her, and tells me if she has any issue with the transfer, she'll get help at the branch before she goes to work.

Should I have said I couldn't deposit it into the linked account? In hindsight, yes, I should have. But when you tell me to put it into the JOINT account, and there's only ONE? Bonus financial advice: if you have an ACH payment that evening, don't have only $3 in your account. A cheque won't be available immediately.",2015-07-31 00:09:29
The legend of Randy,15,3dzg8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3dzg8j/the_legend_of_randy/,2,1437422187.0," This summer I worked at the Boys and Girls Club, a job masquerading as an internship, for 6 weeks. For those of you who don't know what the Boys and Girls Club is, your property value might be too high.

 Randy is a member of this ""club,"" a 6 year old kid who took a liking to me, fuck me for trying to be empathetic because this is just the beginning of a new form of torture.

 Week 1. Randy comes to me and tells me some kids keep calling him ""Randy Cunningham,"" what am I supposed to do, being the namesake of a popular cartoon character isn't anybody's fault, I jsut politely told them to stop. They did for a little while, but when they started up again Randy started crying. I told him to go sit back on the bleachers, he sat on the floor(right next to an active game of Flag Football) and I told him he has to sit down. ""Why?"" ""Because you have to, it's the rules"" he goes and sits under the bleachers and starts crying. Everyday for the rest of the week he cries and runs to me because some kids make fun of him. One day during lunch, he asks if he can help. I say ""Go ask Ms.Cherry for some gloves"" he says ""No, can you go get the gloves, shes gonna say no."" ""Well if she sees you helping, Im going to get in trouble"" ""But your staff, the other staff let kids help them"" ""Theyre my bosses"" Randy starts crying.

 Week 2. It's reading time, we read everyday before lunch. Randy walks up to me and asks me if he can stand up, ""No, your only supposed to be up here if you're in trouble"" ""But I want to stand"" ""No"" Randy starts crying. One day the club let in kids early, I came to work, Randy is crying again. Unexplained. I ask the kid next to him what happened, he don't know nuffin'. Everyone starts calling Randy a crybaby, I asked him if he wanted to stand next to me, he doesnt say anything and stands.

Week 3. You're seeing a pattern by now, Randy cried, let's move on.

Week 4. Randy gets a new friend and a new attitude. Introducing, Kevin, he's 7, and is a bad influence. Randy starts picking on people and generally being a nuisance under the guiding hand of Kevin, everyone's complaining, Randy gets in a fight with local bad boy Brion, Brion pushes Randy and Randy does something rather predictable. A few more days of serving lunch and watching kids play sports, Randy complains about having to follow rules and cries because he can't help with lunch, the other staff members say dont baby him and one guy picks him up and takes him to the front desk.

Week 5. I didn't see Randy for like, three full days! Then, Thursday,  Randy starts cheating at Flag Football, tying his flag and what not. So we switch to Basketball, Randy cheated at that too, every time he caught the ball he dropped on the floor and started yelling ""ball,"" so I took him out of the game, surprise, he cried. The next day he did this again.

Week Final: AKA Randy works up the nerve. Randy comes up to me while I'm on bathroom duty(sit in a chair in the bathroom and tell kids not to play in there, occasionally cleaning it.) and Randy comes up to me with a bag of gummy things, fruit snacks I think, and gives them to me, Walks away. He comes back and asks me to help. ""With what"" ""I'll watch the bathroom if you fall asleep"" ""no Randy"" ""But you're staff""(meaningless title still) ""I can't let you help or else I'll get in trouble"" ""But you're staff"" ""My boss doesn't like when I let people help"" ""You have a boss?"" ""Yes, goodbye Randy."" Randy does his usual routine. ""Goodbye, Randy"" ""But if I leave I have to take the gummies back."" ""Here you go"" ""But if I take them back you'll call me mean"" ""No I wont, goodbye."" Randy falls on the floor. A few minutes later one of my coworkers comes by and asks me whats wrong, ""He wanted to help"" ""Help do what?"" ""Exactly"" so he takes Randy back to the Gym. Later, Randy is sharing out the gummies and walks up to me and asks me if I'm still mad at him, I never acted like I was mad so this question was an obvious sign of a failed guilt trip. Some sort of calamity happens and like four kids, including Randy are fighting, we break it up and they say their ""playing"" I ignore them until my final day is over, good thing I didn't tell Randy I was leaving though.",2015-07-20 22:56:27
CNC cutter and sheets made by Satan,19,3dhh0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3dhh0u/cnc_cutter_and_sheets_made_by_satan/,1,1437036168.0,"So I work at a place that makes traffic signs. Maybe 35~ employees total and I'm one of the summer temps for the second year in a row.

The process of making traffic signs isn't too complicated. We have these rolls of reflective plastic in one of three sizes (45.7m x 770/960/1220mm) that we feed through a giant printer. Then we laminate the rolls and after that cut shit out with a CNC cutter.

But sometimes for some ~~odd~~ purely evil reason we're asked to just cut out the shapes straight from the unprinted rolls and ship them off to some other place to get ""painted"" with some super-thin paint. I don't question it too much even though the result usually looks like absolute shit. We've had shit come back with flies dead on the thing UNDER the paint itself and sometimes even had ones where it looked like someone took a weegie and some turpentine and dragged it across half the thing.

So for triangle ""silk prints"" we cut from 770s. The total width of the cut pattern is ~740mm. Not much space on each side left, but surely this is no problem? Oh jesus f'ing kitten-killing christ. I think for the first half hour the thing kept stopping every minute because the cutting head was moving along the sheet with such forcw that the suction in the mat of the cutter couldn't keep it still. There's a good reason that all prints we make have at the very least 2cm from each edge because this happens. Whoever thought that this was a great idea is ab asshole. Sure, I could grab a 960 roll and cut from that, but that would more than a few m^2 per roll in the trash.

Fuck silk prints. Especially the triangles.",2015-07-16 11:42:48

Quickly improving a plan, I called him over while I primed the spray bottle by pumping it a couple times. He walked up just as the first few drops finally made their way out into the trash can.

Anyhow, we get a call claiming that the toilet doesn't work. So I head out there and before I even knock on the door, I can smell something awful coming from the kitchen window. He lets me in and brings me to his kitchen sink and says, ""My toilet's broken!"" It's jammed full of urine and excrement. I ask him after a minute of being shocked at that horrible sight, ""What do you consider your sink is?""  He brought me to his perfectly working toilet and showed what he uses for fresh water to cook and drink with.  I get my boss and call the tenant that is on the lease.      

The dude is the tenant's brother and some good charity folks from America came to his country and built a system to ensure fresh and clean water was delivered to their toilets after a hurricane and political infighting wrecked things for the people. The good charity folks forgot to help them with their drinking water situation. Since the country is too darn poor to fix it themselves, I'm sure you can imagine how that screwed up kids and people growing up there. The tenant cleaned things up and after a few months, kicked his younger brother out of his apartment when he refused to change his ways. He refused to believe clean water comes from the kitchen sink. The plumber we usually use wasn't surprised and even correctly guessed which country they came from.    

I'm not going to say which country it is because I don't want to cause unnecessary drama.   ",2015-07-13 00:21:50

Me: Well when is the last time you used the restroom?

Him: About an hour ago.

Me: Well, there was shit in the sink, and you're the only person that I know in this world who washes his ass in the sink, and you did it an hour ago. The evidence is kind of stacked against you. You did say that you wash your ass in the sink, didn't you?

Him: Yeah. If I don't, any little trace the toilet paper leaves behind makes me chafe. I can hardly walk once I get home at the end of the day.

So confounding in their work that it made you wonder how they are still employed?

I have, and we'll call him Dipstick.

Many years ago I worked for an electronics repair shop. We fixed everything from TVs to home theater and car audio. I won't say I was an expert in what I did, but I certainly didn't make mistakes that cost the company money. A few years after my hire, workflow has improved so we hire Dipstick fresh out of tech school.

Now that the backstory is complete, here's a **short** list of things that made me cringe, with helpful cost notes: (My labor cost excluded, I had to deal with all these)

**$140.00** Dipstick forgot that the really long 3inch screws don't go in the back of a 1inch flatscreen TV. He proceeded to giggle and cover it with epoxy when I pointed it out to him. The giggling infuriated me so much I had to take an approved 1hour break.

**A LOT of headache** Dipstick, for whatever reason, was formatting the boss's desktop to update to a newer OS and forgot to backup 6months of sales data. Just wiped the whole thing. Luckily, boss had home backup but still lost a week as he was getting ready to transfer it the next day.

**$1,800** Dipstick broke a plasma TV screen when he left the torque on MAX for his drill. He drilled a screw in and didn't realize there was plastic wedged between the glass, proceeded to break the screen by ramming the screw down too hard. After I had just (literally 15sec before) instructed him to turn his torque down on his drill. *Fun* ensues when he dropped it on the floor as I was informing my boss.

**$700** Dipstick, in the process of repairing a tuner from a board on an LCD TV, somehow broke the ribbon cable connector on two separate unrelated boards. Proceeded to cover it up with epoxy and return to cust, who returned stating that now the TV didn't turn on. Electrical taped over the epoxy and returned to cust again, who returned to us again same issue. Ended up replacing both boards out of company's pocket.

**$3,000** Dipstick mislabeled a brand new under-warranty TV as scrap, proceeds to place with other scrapped sets. Warehouse guy throws out said brand new TV as, well, it was labeled scrap and with the other ones. Blames warehouse guy for not reading the label because warehouse guy has learning disability. I find now destroyed set with label that says SCRAP and comfort warehouse guy.

**$500** Blows up car audio amp and speaker by hooking up wrong that customer was about to pay for. (Had money literally in hand, wanted to see it work) Not in their car mind you, at his workstation. You know, with the safety and special hookups and diagram instructing how to hook it up properly.

**Headaches beyond headaches** Dipstick would intentionally not listen to me (a senior tech) and *openly tell me so*. Not because he felt I was wrong, but because I wasn't his direct supervisor nor was I given the title of supervisor. (Although it was offered) By god, I'm just trying to help out.

**So much wasted time** Dipstick would constantly avoid as much work as possible by playing on his laptop while at work. There was one day my manager and I timed him. He spent 4 hours fiddling/dicking around with what we set up as a 30min job. Not that he didn't know how, he just spent 99% of his time on his laptop and bitched me out every time I checked in on him.

Dipstick was still working there after I quit, for a total of 4 or 5 years. I don't know how he was never fired. There were many times he was taken off anything valued over $200 due to him being a liability, and he was never allowed in a customer's home. Last I heard he was working for ComCast. -LOL!",2015-07-04 20:53:41

It turns out that ""L"" is the owners 'replacement'. The idea was to give me all the admin responsibilities, and ""L"" the customer and product ordering. ""L"" needed a desk, and wanted mine. I of coursed refused and we settled on sharing the office space. It took 2 months to get ""L"" to agree on a desk. They wanted a joint desk, I wanted to pick one up from IKEA, I won.

Dealing with Crazy 5,39,3bdv1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3bdv1r/dealing_with_crazy_5/,7,1435477890.0,"One of the buildings that I manage has it's apartments broken up in sections. Six apartments is grouped to each section and each section is protected by auto-locking doors. Each door's hinges is set to spring close and the door knobs auto locks by itself. You need to only use the key on the outside knob.   

One apartment of one section calls me up to tell me that the hallway door is difficult to open. I check it and determine that the lock has been damaged over time and possible misuse. I remove the lock and put in it's place a non locking door knob so that I can ensure each apartment has a key to the new lock prior to installing it. The owner's policy is that I am have to take back the old key from each apartment as I give them the new key. I am able to do this for 4 of the six apartments. This is what happened with the sixth apartment.  

Just to clarify... this tenant is an older gentleman that seems to take pleasure in being obnoxious.  
I call the tenant ahead of the time to ask when they will be there so I can give them the new key. We set an appointment. 
I ring his door bell and wait patiently outside his door. A few minutes go by and I decide to knock on the door. I know he's home because I saw him enter the building as I parked my car. I call his phone after a minute goes by. I can hear his phone within the apartment. He answers the phone.    
**Tenant:** Hello?  
**me:** Mr. XXX? I'm outside your apartment door.   
**Tenant:** What for?  
**me:** We set up an appointment so I can give you the key for the hallway door.   
**Tenant:** No, I didn't!   
**me:** Okay. Can I give you the key now?   
**Tenant:** I'm not home!   
I can clearly hear him as I stand outside his apartment. He sounds like he is within his living room.   

**me:** When will you be home?  
**Tenant:** When are you going to fix that hallway door!  
**me:** What is wrong with it?  
**Tenant:** It doesn't lock anymore! How can be safe if it doesn't lock?  
**me:** I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   
**Tenant:** That's not right! How can I live in this building if the hallway door doesn't lock? I have lived in this building for twenty three years and this is simply not ACCEPTABLE!  
**me:** I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   
**Tenant:** THAT DOOR DOESN'T LOCK! MAN, HOW DUMB ARE YOU?  
**me:** I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   
**Tenant:** DON'T YOU YELL AT ME! I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR 23 YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THIS!  
**me:**  *I haven't yelled at him and I'm trying to not get into an argument with him, so I just keep my mouth shut for a while*   
**Tenant:** WELL? Don't you have anything to say?  
**me:**  I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock. When will you be in the apartment?  
**Tenant:** Tomorrow.  
**me:** Or you can open the door now and I can give you the key.   
**Tenant:** Are you deaf or just STUPID?  
**me:** Can you please open the door, so I can give you the new key?  
**Tenant:** I AM NOT HOME.   
**me:** okay. At what time will you be home?  
**Tenant:** Tomorrow at 8 PM! And Don't be late!   

He slams the phone down.  It's not a cell phone. I can hear the phone rattle in the apartment from the force of his blow. 
I walk over the hallway door and I open the door. I let the springed hinges auto-close the door. It makes a very loud sound. I then stand near his door. He opens it and then is startled by my presence.   

**me:** Sir, can I have the old key so I can give the new key?  
*He walks over the hallway door and then points at the my temporary door knob.*    
**Tenant:** There is no lock!  
**me:**  I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   
**Tenant:** THERE IS NO LOCK HERE.  
**me:** That is temporary.   
**Tenant:** Install the new one and then give me the key.   
**me:**  I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key.   
**Tenant:** I heard you the first time. Install it and then give me the key.    
**me:** This policy isn't new. Please just give me the old key.   
**Tenant:** THEN FIX THE DAMN LOCK!  

At this point the last apartment that I need to give the key to opens. Another rather obnoxious older man walks out and asks me what's wrong.   

**me:** Sir, I am trying to replace this lock. Can you please give me the old key and I can give you the new key?  
He tries to argue and then his wife hits him in the back of his head, hands him the key and tells him, ""Don't be an asshole and get this over with it."" An exchange of keys occurs and I thank him. He closes the door.   
*I look at the Tenant. He walks back to his apartment and then looks at me.*    
**me:** Sir, can I please get the old key now?  
**Tenant:** I have lived here for 23 years and this is ...  
From within the another apartment we hear another lady yell, ""WOULD YOU GIVE HIM THE KEY ALREADY!""  
Tenant shakes his head and gives me the key while muttering to himself. I check to make sure it's the right key and then hand him back the key he gave me. ""That's the wrong key.""   
**Tenant:** WHAT? THAT IS THE RIGHT ...  
At this point the other five apartments all open their doors. A bunch of ladies walk up to him and tells him to stop being an asshole and give me the right key. The correct exchange of keys occurs and everyone goes back to their apartment. It takes me fifteen minutes to replace the lock & ensure the door is operating properly before I leave.  

Just to clarify some things, this particular tenant and a few others is the reason why the policy exists. I had changed the hallway lock before and he would spent months playing stupid games while complaining loudly that he doesn't have the key. Games like pretending he's not there or that he won't open the door after a certain time, etc. We can not just stick the key in an envelope and shove it under his door with a note explaining the situation because he will claim that he never received the key. We cannot install the lock and then wait for each tenant to come home to find a locked door. When they find that they can not enter it will create anger and irritation and in some cases, they will just break the door or lock to get past the barrier. Some will contact the super or the management, a few will break down the door and one *-guess who-* will call the city and claim that we are trying to illegally kick him out of the building. We have tired many different iterations and learned this really is the best way. He just enjoys being obnoxious.",2015-06-28 10:51:30

A camera watches the exterior, the monitor is above my desk and I watch people struggle with these obstacles all day long.

Today:  

Watch the person approach door, pace along the door, look in, look around, stare at door, stare at intercom button, stare at door again, pace in a circle, look at door, then wander way.

There is a sign by the intercom button in bold letters that says: **""Press and release button to contact front desk.""**  Sign is super necessary because the highest offense is visitors press and hold the button while yelling at it, as if was a push-to-talk radio. All this does is make the intercom go ""BWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" on my end until they let go.

The person wanders around the corner of the building like they're looking for another door. I go outside and yell at them. They hurry over to me. To be nice, I pretend like they were smart and pushed the damn button so they have the chance to save face. 

""Hey, did the button not work? I didn't hear it beep to let you in.""

Most take the hint and sheepishly say something like ""I guess it didn't."" Not today.

""Huh? Oh, umm... I looked at the button but I didn't press it. I should have, but I didn't."" *(actual quote)*

""Well... you have to push the button for it to work.""

I fixed appliance for quite a while and had one lady saying the water dispenser on her fridge ""wasn't working properly."" I get there and the damn thing is working just fine. Flow is good, not splashing everywhere, so I asked her to show me what she was talking about.

She proceeds to put the glass up to get water, but turns it 90degrees sideways before pressing the button. I kid you not, literally ------- horizontal. So, I kindly explain that gravity does not work that way and to get water into the glass you need to actually have the open part facing up, you know, to catch the water.

She insisted that since the product wasn't working to her satisfaction she demanded a new one or a full refund. It should work ""the way she wants it to"" or she won't be having it. I promptly told her to chalk it up with the warranty and have a good day, skipping right out of her house.

I was the 6th person from a 3rd company over 8 separate trips to go out there for the same problem. To lay out how much money she wasted from both the warranty and the contracted companies, it would be about $700. And she didn't pay a single dime of it.",2015-06-26 10:02:20

The equipment we use is fairly heavy, just slightly lighter than actual guns (or so says a friend who was in the marines says). Today, I had a session with a bunch of younger kids. I really don't like working with younger kids because they never listen to my instructions or the rules of the different games. 

Well, this group was a birthday party. We used to give out a free tee shirt to the birthday boy. We don't do that any more, by order of the owners. The kid thought we still did that, then threw a fit when I had to tell him we didn't. The whole session the kid just got to be more and more of a prick. Kid was a terrible shot, but always blamed either the equipment or someone else of cheating. The whole time, the kids mother takes his side, blaming everyone the little brat did. But during the middle game, where one team has to defend the central base against an endless hoard of enemies. About half way through, one of the kids runs out shouting that there was a fight. 

I stopped the game, and ran into the base. I could hear shouting. Sure enough, the prick was slamming the butt of the rifle into another kid's chest, yelling about cheating. I grab the gun away from him and have to drag the kid, who is now crying, out to his mother.  And then she starts yelling at me. Apparently the kid that got beat up was his brother, and it was just boys being boys. I'd have called an ambulance for the kid if my cell phone had not been dead, but as it was she was the only one with a phone. She started screeching at me when I started packing up the equipment. She went off on the whole ""I'm going to have you fired"" thing. I feel so bad for not being able to do anything. It is even worse because the kid was kind of ""cheating."" It was a spur of the moment game, and I hadn't had time to check that everything was working right. One of the sensors on the kid's gear was out and couldn't be hit.",2015-06-25 00:49:54

I asked them what was wrong and they pointed at the stove. I asked them to be please tell what's wrong and then they told me to leave the apartment. They didn't give me a reason.""   
**Judge:** *directed at tenant* What was wrong with the stove?   
**tenant:** It's broken!  
**Judge:** *directed at tenant and points at me* He just said that the stovetop and oven was working and that you didn't specify what's wrong with the stove. You haven't paid your rent for 4 months over this. So tell me, what is EXACTLY wrong with your stove.   
**tenant:** It's dirty. They need to clean it or buy me another one.

Legal stuff occurs. Later in the apartment while the owner is counting out the money that has been paid to him, I am reading and explaining how to use the oven cleaner.

**Lady:** Hello, is the apartment at XXXX and is it still available?  
**me:** Yes. May I have your name?  
**Lady:** No. Now what do I need to give to you to take this apartment.   
**me:** May I have your name, Please?  
**Lady:** No.  Do you understand English?  
**me:** I will hang up if you do not tell me your name.  
**Lady:** I am not comfortable with giving that information over the phone.  
**me:** Goodbye.   
**Lady:** Wait! It's XXX.  
**me:** Ok, XXX is this just for you?  
**Lady:** No, It's for me, my husband and two of my kids.   
**me:** What do you and your husband do for a living?  
**Lady:** I'm a school teacher and my husband works as a bus driver.   
**me:** How much do you roughly make a year?  
**Lady:** I don't see why you need to know this before I see the apartment.   
**me:** This is an initial interview with potential customers. I use this time to determine if you meet the criteria that the Landlord has put prior to showing.  
**Lady:** I see. I make a 100k a year and my husband makes 50k a year.   
**me:** I can show the apartment any time between 8 AM to 8 PM.   
**Lady:** I can be there at 4 PM. Is the address at the bottom of the advertisement correct?  
**me:** Yes, the apartment is located at.....  
**Lady:** I will be there.   
**me:** Call me when you arrive and I can be out there within XX minutes.   
**Lady:** Or you can be there for our appointment.   
**me:** Too many people disappoint me and never show up.   
**Lady:** Fine. *She hangs up*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I get a few more calls and one more couple decides they will be there at that time as well. The lady calls me at 4:40 PM, to tell me that she has arrived and is waiting for me. I get a call three minutes later from the couple as well. I might be disappointed in them if I didn't expect this by now.  

I'm driving to the location and before 5 minutes go by since the Lady has talked to me, I get a phone call.  
**Lady:** Are you coming?  
**me:** Yes. I will be there in 5 minutes.  
**Lady:** I have been waiting here for an hour for you already!    
**me:** You called me a few minutes ago, not an hour ago.  
*She hangs up*  
  
I arrive at the location and find both waiting in the courtyard of the complex.   
**me:** Hello, I am XXX and you are here to see the apartment? I will take you up now.   
**Lady:** We all have been waiting an hour for you!  
**Couple:** We just got here 8 or 10 minutes ago.  
The Lady and the husband doesn't seem to acknowledge their presence. They rudely push their way through them to follow immediately behind me. It's a bit disconcerting to see that behavior especially since as potential customers they are making themselves look bad in front of me. The husband seems to the silent type that communicates through grunts and nods.   

I get to the door and unlock it. Before I can open it the Lady asks a question.  
**Lady:** Wait one moment. Will you be the one that decides who takes the apartment?  
**me:** No. The landlord will decide.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Lady then pushes me out the way, opens the door and walks into the apartment. The husband grunts as he walks past me. The couple exclaims on their rudeness. I let the couple in and give them a quick layout of the apartment before letting them explore. The female of the couple is walking down the hallway, heading to the bedrooms when the Lady appears from the bedrooms, shoves her into the closet in the hallway and walks up to me. She didn't even apologize to her.  She is very rude and making an horrible impression on me.   

**Lady:** I like the place. I want it. I have the money, tell you boss to get over here on the double.   
Her Husband grunts in agreement.   

**me:** That isn't how it works. You must fill out an application and bring back necessary proofs of id & work history as well as pay an small nonrefundable application fee.   
**Lady:** FEE! Fine. Give me the application, I'll pay later.   
**me:** No. Payment first.   
Lady's Husband: Stop giving him a hard time. He just works here.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Lady hands over the fee and takes the application. I take from them their names and phone number and some other bits of information. She walks out with her husband. The couple asks a few questions and also take an application.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The couple calls me later that night and asks to drop off everything in the morning. I agree and tell them the best time. That morning, the landlord express interest to meet the couple and take the application since he is in the area for an unrelated reason.  I tell him that the couple will be waiting in the courtyard. I call up the couple and tell them where to wait. The Lady then calls me and tells me that she will be there to drop up the paperwork. I tell the landlord and then go about my business.   

**Landlord:** Hello. Are you XXX?   
**the Couple:** Yes. We are. Your agent told us to bring the application and our proofs. He told us ....  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them discuss some business and leave. The Lady's Husband arrives and hands the paperwork to the landlord and then asks him if he will decide on who gets the apartment as the landlord reads through the documents.   

**Landlord:** Sir, can you wait one moment before you leave?  
**Lady's Husband:** Yes?  
**Landlord:** It says here that you are 23. You look more like you are in your late fifties.   
The Lady's Husband pulls out his employee badge that shows his birth date to be 23 years ago. He is in person very visibly in his late 50s. The badge's picture has a much younger face with a different first name than is listed in the application.   
**Landlord:** Okay. So these are both your kids and they are in fact 11 and 12 years old?   
**Lady's Husband:** Of course! Is that it?  
**Landlord:** Where do you live now?  
**Lady's Husband:** I am renting a space at the address provided. I'm just looking for a bigger space. I am raising kids after all.   
The Lady's Husband leaves and I get the applications later from the landlord. My boss relates the events with some humor.   

I do a check on the information they provided and do a little investigation of my own from other sources. Many potential customers are surprised later to find that I don't just use the information they submitted in my decisions.   

I get a call from the Lady.  
**me:** Hello.  
**Lady:** Did you review my application? Is it a Yes or a No?  
**me:** I have some questions you need to answer first.   
**Lady:** I don't have the time for that. Is it Yes or a No?  
**me:** My decision is based upon the information you give me as well what I can derive.  If you can not answer my questions then it is a No.   
**Lady:** Fine. What are they?  
**me:** Where are you living now?  
**Lady:** I am renting an apartment. The address in in the application.  
**me:** Do you mean....  
**Lady:** Yes, that's it.   
**me:** So you don't own that property?    
**Lady:** Why would I rent property that I own. *She laughs*  
**me:** So these public records that I found that shows that you owned this property since 1995 and have remortgaged it three times since is wrong?  
**Lady:** I didn't give those records!  
**me:** I told you that I will check your id and past work history. It would be pretty lazy of me to only use what you give me.    
**Lady:** This is a clear invasion of privacy!   
**me:** Public record.   
Lady hangs up. I never hear from her again. My investigation from her has found that she rents multiple apartments across NYC and owns three buildings. Her son is 33 and is currently serving a prison sentence for something that I haven't determined and those kids are his. No wife. I don't understand what they are playing at and I don't want to be involved.  ",2015-06-22 17:10:05

**Wife:** Hello. I'm inquiring about the advertisement I saw on {insert ad source here}, is it still available?  
**me:** Hello. It is is still available. I can show the property during this time period. Is it for you?  
**Wife:** No it's for my husband, he teaches at a college in NYC and commutes to work from Maryland everyday. I convinced him to stop wasting gas on his beast and to live in the city for a week and then come home. He has been now wasting money in expensive hotels and I decided to help him look for a small property to live during the week. Does the property have.....  
**me:** Yes. It does.   
**Wife:** That's wonderful! I'll give him your name and number and tell him the time period you are available so he can come over and look at. Thank you.   
**me:** Your welcome, Goodbye.     

I get his call late last night. We work out an appointment time a few hours after the crack of dawn.    
He arrives and except for his sandals, he looks very much like a stereotypical Indian College Professor in America.   

**College Professor:** Good morning. Can I see the property?  
**me:** You can't double park your car there and it is blocking the driveway.   
**College Professor:** Oh, it will be fine.   
**me:** I'm renting this parking lot to a few clients. Your vehicle blocks their way. Please move it. There is also a police station a few blocks down on this very street and their morning shift just started.   
**College Professor:** There is no other parking spots. I also don't mind the ticket.   
**me:** If you don't move the vehicle then I will have no choice but to have it towed.   
**College Professor:** I'm a potential client. That is certainly not the way to treat me.   
**me:** I have clients that use the parking lot and I would not be respecting them if I let you get away with this. Please move the vehicle.   
**College Professor:** He moves the vehicle out of the way and still double parks it on the street, a mere few meters from two perfectly good parking spots.   
**College Professor:** Can I see it now?  
**me:** The cops tend to be cranky this early in the morning and this close to their precinct. They will do something to your vehicle.   
**College Professor:** My wife's a brain surgeon. I have enough money to pay some tickets. Can I see the property now.  
**me:** Ok, please follow me.   

I show him the property. He seems to like it.   

**College Professor:** The property is much smaller than I was lead to believe.   
**me:** No. This property is exactly this XXX sq feet.   
**College Professor:** Then you obviously don't know anything about marketing.   
**me:** I'm sorry?  
**College Professor:** You see, you always over-exaggerate the dimension of the item and the condition of the property to attract potential customers. Then you use obfuscation tactics to hide the truth when they see it person.     
**me:** That's both false advertising, immoral and doesn't that mean you expected this property to be smaller than what the advertisement said it was?  
**College Professor:** He ignores the last bit of my response. “But not illegal.”  
**Me:** No.  
**College Professor:** Trust me. I do know what I'm talking about.  
**Me:** No. You don't and stop trying to convince me. It is a waste of my time.   

**College Professor:** Okay, then what is the particulars involved?  
**me:** As the ad said, all utilities is included except you will have to pay a little extra if you install a AC or an electric heater. Cable is not included and you can't install a satellite dish. First month's rent + Security Deposit + Application Fee + this fresh install of a CO/smoke/fire detector fee + a Prorated Fee.   
**College Professor:** I never heard of the term Prorated. What is it?  
**me:** The fee depends on when you move in. It is determined by dividing the monthly rent by the number of days of this month and then multiplying it by the number of days left in the month when you sign the lease.   
**College Professor:** We can negotiate all of this of course.   
**me:** no. The owner does not negotiate.   
**College Professor:** But he has to if he wants to run a successful business.   
**me:** The owner does not negotiate. You can either accept the terms or leave.   
**College Professor:** I'm only going to sleep here. I don't need the detector.   
**me:** It's illegal to provide a studio or apartment without one in NYC and this one is electrically wired in.  
**College Professor:** Surely, we can come to a different arrangement.  
**me:** No.  
**College Professor:** Your parents came from India?  
**me:** Yes.  
**College Professor:** I'm from India as well!  
**me:** So?  
**College Professor:** So surely we can...  
**me:** There is no preferential treatment given. No negotiation on the price. If you like the property and wish to rent here, then you must fill out an application and provide certain proofs.   
**College Professor:** And then I can give you the money to rent here for a few days?  
**me:** No. Once you submit the paperwork, then I will check the proofs submitted, run a credit check on you and a few other checks on your past history. I will then submit it to the owner and the owner will decide whether he wants to rent to you or not. You must also sign a 1 year lease.   
**College Professor:** There is too many constraints here. You can not possibly run this business like this.    
**me:** Are you interested?  
**College Professor:** We can come to a better arrangement.  
**me:** Please stop trying to negotiate. You are wasting my time.  
**College Professor:** I still have a trump card. You don't want me to use it.  
**me:** Can you leave now? You are just wasting my time.  
**College Professor:** I can complain to the city that you are running an illegal tenements.   
**me:** What?  
**College Professor:** This building is obviously a house redesigned illegally into an tenement.  
**me:** This building was originally a hotel and then converted into an apartment building and all of the apartments and studios are legal rent stabilized apartments. The XXX will probably laugh at your complaint and then close it. Now, please stop wasting my time.    
**College Professor:** “You'll see. You'll be sorry.” He leaves.   

His wife calls me later that night to apologize for her husband's behavior and asks me to fax the documents to her. I tell her that the owner does not do business like that. The owner would rather have the potential customer come in person and take the application and the list of proofs needed. She tells me that she will send her son to pick it up. I give the application and the paperwork.   

The College Professor shows up to give in the paperwork. We are standing outside the property.   
**College Professor:** “This is all of it and this letter,” he winks at me as he hands me a sealed envelope, “is the letters from my employment.”    
**Me:** I open the letter as he tries to stop me. I find a $300 with the employment letter. “I cannot accept money at this time. Take this back.”  
**College Professor:** He takes the money back and then pulls out a money clip and ask me, “How much to put my application above the rest?”  
**me:** Through the information that you have provided and your application.   
**College Professor:** Think of it as a gift.  
**me:** No. I deal with information. No one is given preferential treatment over the other.  
**College Professor:** You look young.  
**me:** …  
**College Professor:** I do know of few young girls that...  
**me:** No.   
**College Professor:** or young men...  
**me:** No.   
**College Professor:** Are you a priest in your free time?  
**me:** No. Goodbye.   ",2015-06-19 21:42:15
Dealing with Crazy 1,56,3aaknx,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/3aaknx/dealing_with_crazy_1/,4,1434640805.0,"[@#$ = various profanity][Edits are made to make this more clear.]

I work for a real estate company that manages an group of apartment buildings and we tend to get all sorts of applicants. Some people surprises us.   

I had a studio for rent that I put up for advertisement that was best for one person and that's it. At 450 sq feet with a separate locked bathroom in the hall outside the studio, it tends to be grabbed up by single college students and older retired folk than anyone else.   

*phone rings*  
**me:** Hello.  
**Gentleman:** Hello. My name is XYZ.  Is the studio still available for rent?  
**me:** Yes it is. The studio is best for one person. (I have to say that since I have learned that people generally don't read ads completely)  

**Gentleman:** I live with a child and dog is that fine?   
**me:** 450 sq feet is really small. It's best for 1 person. If you like, you can come and see it but I don't think it's big enough for you.   
**Gentleman:** That is perfectly fine. We don't need much space. What time can I come.  
**me:** You can.... (I'm trying to omit irrelevant details that needs to be anonymized)  

So at the appointed time. An old minivan parks near the building. The Gentleman steps out wearing a suit you would expect a british butler would wear, he's African-American and very thin. I assumed that a child stepped out next but I quickly realized that she was a midget. She wore a purple tutu, had a multicolored mohawk and leather jacket with a pair of heavy army boots. The driver also stepped out and he was wearing an identical suit to the Gentleman and a dog collar and much younger than he.  The Gentleman lead the pack to me.   

**me:**Hello. Are you here for the studio.   
**Gentleman:** Yes. We are.   
**me:** It's 450 square feet. It's too small for three people.   
Gentleman gestured to his two companions and said: It's perfect for me, my child-@#$ and cur.   
The Younger man slapped the back of his head so hard that the Gentleman staggered forward. The Gentleman turned to face him and got an uppercut to his groin by the midget. He crumbled to the floor.   

The younger man strode back to the van and the midget in a voice far louder than I thought could come from her said, ""I told you to @#$ quit with the profanity and to @#$ing find a proper apartment for us you little @#$!""  
The Gentleman looked up at her not in fear or horror or surprise but of total love.   
**The Midget:** I'm sorry the studio is far too small for our needs. Do you have anything else that is big enough to accommodate 3 people?  
**me:** No Ma'am.   
The Midget smiled at me and said, ""Thank you and I'm sorry we wasted your time.""     
She then spat in the Gentleman's face and strode off to the minivan.   

The  Gentleman got up, dusted himself off with a brush that he pulled out of his pocket. He combed his hair and made himself look more presentable again. He then started to apologize for the event that occurred and then asked me if I had anything else for rent. Then he face scrunched up with pain and with what I think was pleasure. The midget had came back and from behind him, grabbed his groin hard and started to pull him back to the minivan.  
**The midget:** You @#$ing @#$! Would you get you ass back to the van already!  
When they got back to the van I heard a series of profanities that ended with, ""You came! You could even wait till we got home?! You are @#$ing getting the cane when we get back @#$!""  

I didn't move from my spot the entire time. I am still not sure if that was real or if it was some sort of elaborate prank.  ",2015-06-18 18:20:05
Rock Factory 4: The High Speed Atmosphere,19,39tlop,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/39tlop/rock_factory_4_the_high_speed_atmosphere/,0,1434303019.0,"They've been having me float around the rock factory lately, helping whoever needed it. It gave me an opportunity to get away from Onions and see some of the other people around the factory. Although, I do want to tell one quick story about Onions that also sort of illustrates the chain of command in the factory.

I'm at the peon level. Even though there's a running joke that I'm actually the High Speed lead, I'm just at the same level as Onions and the rest of everyone in that area. Redwood, in addition to running a machine, is the actual High Speed lead, so he ends up stopping the machine a lot to address everyone's issues. Above Redwood is Tom, who's the production supervisor. He's in charge of making sure everything in the actual factory is running smoothly. Above that is Singer, the plant director. He's more in charge of strategy than tactics; he orders new machines and hires new employees. He's also one of the Big Four. If the Rock Factory was a video game, the four biggest bosses would be Singer, Mechin (the facilities, maintenance and safety director), Chester (the supply chain director), and Baller (the CEO).

Now, Singer interviewed and hired Onions, and Techin gave him his orientation tour, but Tom is the one who trained him and told him what to do from his first day of employment. Now, a month later, Redwood happened to mention that Tom was the supervisor in a story or whatever, and Onions is completely surprised. I remember one day Tom told Onions that he would be loading in the 6Barrel area instead of Pez. Onions straight up told him that's not what he got hired for. It makes a lot more sense that he'd do that, not knowing Tom was his boss's boss...

This story, though, is about some of the others around the factory, and what we put each other through. There are a lot of people who take jokes really well, so there are always pranks. Usually they involve someone getting chemicals on them. A classic one is when Redwood was working in the APP area, the lead told him to ask the then-supervisor about an order. The then-supervisor was a woman, and she's since been promoted to the Head of Sales. The APP Lead told Redwood there was an order that had to ship today that he couldn't find, and that he needed Redwood to go ask the supervisor about the ""cunnilingus"" order. At the time, Redwood was apparently pretty naive, because he did. Luckily, this is the rock factory, so everyone thought it was hilarious. Redwood was thoroughly embarrassed, and there wasn't any sexual harassment BS.

I used to be the Warehouse Lead, but then I took leave for a couple months and ended up back at the bottom. Zany, the new warehouse lead, is an awesome guy, but he hates his job because he has to deal with cleaning up after everyone else. While I was bringing a pallet to shipping, he was following behind me in his forklift, trying to get around me to return to the stacks of his lair. He didn't honk or anything, and I'd only barely noticed him out of the corner of my eye, so he was just following behind me since I was walking lively. We got to a choke point right before our paths would split, and I slowed way down, eventually stopping with his way completely blocked. I stand there and start scratching my ass for a second, then turn around at him, grinning. He's just sitting there with his arms out and his head back like ""ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?"" Then he sees me looking at him and knows I'm just messing with him, and he just bends over, laughing and shaking his head at me.

It wasn't too long ago we had a guy with us in High Speed we'll call G. Now, G was a big black guy, but he was also the biggest pansy. He called me OG after I walked up to another machine operator (we'll call him Emo) and turned his music down. To be fair, Emo really tried to project this tough guy persona, but to me he really just came across like a teenage emo boy. The way he dressed, the music he listened to, the way he acted... yet he's older than everyone else in High Speed. Apparently G was a little intimidated. To be fair, we lost G one day when a burner malfunctioned and caught fire. When the flame rose up, G just screamed, ""OH, SH*T!"" and bolted. The burner just got hosed down with a fire extinguisher (PASS is an important acronym in our factory) and the maintenance lead replaced it. We never saw G at the rock factory again, however. He's the kind of guy who abandoned a car on the side of the highway because it broke down, though...

Besides being called Princess Hitler and OG, lately they've been calling me the Honey Badger. About a month ago, a 20lb box of rocks dropped on my head. I ended up being absolutely fine. A couple weeks later, while we were installing new racks in the warehouse, a 200lb beam landed on my foot. Of course, it was literally the one day that I decided not to wear my steel toed boots. Everyone else pointed out how nonchalant I was about it (""Hey, guys, can you get this off my foot?"") and between that, the rocks dropping on my head, and an incident where I started my shift by walking to High Speed, throwing up, then immediately starting doing my job, now Honey Badger is apparently a thing. Although, I'm rather partial to Princess Hitler.",2015-06-14 20:30:19
Rock Factory 3: On the Indivisibility of Orders,20,39cjr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/39cjr1/rock_factory_3_on_the_indivisibility_of_orders/,2,1433970743.0,"Onions doesn't just lack common sense; he seems to go in complete defiance of it.

I'm fairly lucky in that my interactions with him are limited. Mostly we only see each other when he brings me boxes and paperwork, although sometimes he fails to do that and I get to hunt whatever I'm missing down myself. Although, today, he'd been really good about remembering to bring me things. This story, however, is about when he came down just to try and help me get caught up.

There are a number of reasons why the QA position that I was subbing in for is the single hardest in the factory. There was a rotating schedule of which lines would be used by which teams each week, so that the QA guy on the line I'm on this week doesn't get burnt out catching the heaviest, most difficult rocks day after day, week after week. Today, it was probably about 90 degrees where I was standing, and the rocks from three different orders were coming out of the machine at once. It was apparent that I was fighting a losing battle and would have to press the kill switch when Onions came by. He grabbed the (correct) gloves and started helping me with the rocks for two of the orders.

Now, there were three orders coming down. One was the 1"" tall rocks, and the other two were for the same type of rocks, but they were two separate orders. Once you look at the rocks, you can tell what chemicals have been applied and make sure they're right. Y'know, basic QA. After you check them, you box them up and throw them on a skid. 

About three hours later, I'm looking at the paperwork for one of the orders Onions inspected, and I realize the numbers are way off. So, I open the boxes and, lo and behold, Onions has put two completely different orders together. Not like mixed up Order A with Order B. Not even just mixed up the boxes. He put rocks from different orders next to each other in the same box. I was already having a stressful day from looking at the literal three tons of rocks that had come down the line since he had helped me, so I just grabbed the box, found the lead Redwood, pulled two that didn't match out, and gave him a look like ""wtf."" He asked, ""Who did that?"" I turned and glared at Onions, grabbed the box, and went back to grab the rocks coming out of the machine. The QA guy on the line next to me saw the whole thing about about hit the floor laughing. Redwood told him, ""I'm really surprised, usually PH (me) is brutal with Onions.""

Onions ended up coming back and sorting the orders out. Him, my brother and I are also going shooting, ATV riding, and swimming at his place on Sunday.

Bonus story: Redwood got me good today. 

Two of the methods we ship by are freight and courier. Naturally, a pallet travelling by freight is going to fare a lot better than the same boxes being handled individually, so we have special boxes for the courier orders. Now, Onions has no idea about this. Hell, he probably has no idea about what he's doing half the time as he does it. 

Onions comes down to my end and says, ""Hey, Redwood said something about this being a courier order?"" I would not only have to go through and open all of the boxes that I had just taped closed and transfer their contents to the other boxes, but I would first need to trek to the shipping department, grab the boxes, bring them back, FOLD THEM, and put their inserts in. Did I mention we were 50 boxes deep? I about had an aneurysm. 

Onions then said, ""He also told me to tell you he was just kidding."" I walked to the side of the machine and looked down, and he was standing there doubled over laughing. I flipped him off. Both hands. I already have my revenge mostly planned, but that will have to be in Rock Factory 6 or whatever.",2015-06-11 00:12:23

At the very end of our production process in the rock factory, the QA guy checks that the rocks are good before sending them to the customer. It's an exhausting job, and entails checking rocks, box‌ing rocks, stacking boxes on skids, and pulling skids to the shipping department. Most people in the factory are cross-trained to do this so they can jump on and help out as well. 

As it ended up, I was the one who ended up training Onions to check rocks. The rocks come out of the machine several hundred degrees, so there are special thermal gloves that are used to make sure that you don't burn the hell out of yourself. Onions was familiar with how hot the rocks were at this stage of the process, having spent a few previous sessions with me at that end of the machines. At the start of this session, he wasted no time in first grabbing a box, then immediately trying to grab a hot rock with his bare hands.

Now, I could have said something and stopped him, but I'm kind of an ass, and watching him juggle that rock into the box amused the hell out of me. He shook his hands, trying to dissipate the heat left in his fingers, before sheepishly saying, ""I guess I should have worn gloves."" I told him there were some on a table in the vicinity, and then went back to looking at rocks.

When he came back, I'm sure I laughed at him, but Onions is pretty dense, so he carried on with his plan without noting that omen. Again, I could have said something and stopped him, but it was hilarious to watch him try and pick up four hot rocks simultaneously, with his only protection being latex gloves. Needless to say, he got burnt again. I let him just deal with the boxes.

And of course, that incident isn't the end. In the first week since he joined our team, our team ended up having to print the Dark Order. Now, in addition to being an asshole, I'm also pretty anal and demanding about how my rocks and chemicals are. In fact, High Speed has affectionately dubbed me ""Princess Hitler."" My standards are NOTHING compared what needs to go into the Dark Order. The Dark Order calls for a set of several very precise chemical recipes for the rocks. Not only is the customer that places the Dark Order a regular; that customer also regularly returns things that are just not perfect enough. In fact, I think that the ratio of the number of times they've ordered and the times they've returned something is probably 1:1, if not worse. One month, the Dark Order was the ONLY order that any of our customers sent back.

Onions had been learning how to mix chemicals, and was willing to try to make the chemicals for this job himself. The first step is to add various pastes in different ratios by weights. Essentially, you set a container on a scale, then pour in the pastes from thinnest to densest. The weights need to match at every decimal level of precision that our scale has. Also, the pastes aren't very viscous, so you have to make sure you aim for the bottom of the container when pouring or scooping them in so a whole bunch doesn't just get stuck to the side.

Anyways, Onions comes up to the scale, puts on a container, then proceeds pours paste not only into the container (good for him) but also all down the side of the container and even some on the scale as a nice touch. Naturally, the response would be to wipe the scale and unusable part of the glass with solvent to remove the paste, then continue measuring from there. Onions just confidently grabbed the next paste and started measuring it in.

I strode up to him and again stressed how this was the Dark Order, and he didn't want it to come back on him. I pointed out he had to be incredibly careful with his measurements, and that the part all over the side was going to stick to the side, not to mention the part on the scale wasn't even in the glass, yet the scale was measuring them anyway, so his chemicals were inaccurate. He looks at me and says, ""Oh, it's okay, I was way over weight on that paste anyway."" I grab the container out of his hand, throw it in the trash, and tell him to start it over and walked off.

Now, Onions and I go back a ways. That's why I got him the job. And I know that despite being an asshole to him, we're still friends. Or at least, I hope so. I know he used to have an anger management problem, and he actually broke one of his teacher's arms. So far nothing like that's manifested itself at work yet, but I'm kind of nervous with the way that I things I do to him. For example, when I told him that everyone at work called him Onions behind his back because of his bad BO. He raised his eye and said, ""Wait, is this a prank? Because I'm not THAT gullible."" His fiance was there, and she just said, ""No, honey... it's true."" There have been times the man has smelled of literal feces.",2015-06-06 02:13:42
A New Guy Approaches the Workstation,33,38lej4,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/38lej4/a_new_guy_approaches_the_workstation/,0,1433461299.0,"The factory that I work in makes a variety of related products, but the methods by which they are made drastically differ. The station I work in is called High Speed, and I don't want to post exactly what we do (we're big enough it would violate Rule #1), so forgive me if I'm being a bit vague when I describe our process. Essentially, in High Speed, there are teams of three men. The first man goes and grabs the rocks from the warehouse and gets them ready and in reach for the second guy, who puts them in a series of two machines. When the rock comes out of the second machine, the QA guy checks the rock, then boxes it up and hauls it to shipping. Or, if they're bad, he smashes them in a bin.

Now, lately had been a time of great restructuring in the factory. New machines were being added all over the factory, and there was going to be a new line of machines at High Speed - as well as a new team of 3 to run them. Things were getting juggled around so people could get trained, so I became the QA guy, and that left us needing a new stager.

Now, I said there were different products at different parts of the factory, and the other relevant area is known as Pez, because of the way the rocks get stacked together after they're put through the machine over there. It was a different, slower pace over there, and plenty of people who couldn't make it at High Speed were more than capable at Pez. So, when we got our new replacement stager, he had already spent some time over at Pez, and had heard plenty of horror stories from others over there about how brutal High Speed. 

I remember once, I was operating and we had a stager call in sick. We got a temporary replacement from Pez who had never worked at High Speed. The poor guy went from staging 20 pounds of rocks a minute to easily four times that. Not to mention the pallets the rocks came in were 10 feet tall, so he had to repeated climb a stepladder. After less than half an hour into an 8-hour shift, he looked like he was going to die from a heart attack. Apparently he asked the lead if I was mad at him or something because of how hard I was making him work, and got told that that's just how High Speed operated. We ended up switching him out for another guy who had some chops.

Back to the new line woes, though. Our stager-in-training was known as Onions behind his back during his time in Pez. This is because his BO was so bad, your eyes would water up like someone was cutting onions when he stood by you. Not to mention that he had to be told time and time again how to perform basic procedures. He was pretty naive when it came to work, though. One time, the plant manager and the production supervisor were discussing something importannt on the factory floor, and he interrupted them to ask if he had enough job security to quit his other job. They essentially didn't give him an answer either way, and he didn't get the hint his job security would probably improve if he got back to work, so he asked them about four more times before he finally wandered off to whatever he was supposed to be doing. The managers chuckled about it.

At High Speed, he didn't do much better. He could keep the pace up just staging rocks, but he didn't have a good idea of what to do next to keep the line moving. A few incidents that stand out... He got told to make 150g of chemicals for a job, and asked if he could make 200g instead because ""math is hard."" He brought paperwork to my side of the machines, then when I brought it back and told him to fill it out (after showing him how to do it for the second or third time), he brought it back, blank again. And lastly, in High Speed you ""push down boxes."" It's a thing. And he did it wrong. We showed him where to push the boxes and he did it wrong. We went down and rearranged the boxes so they were in the right place, then the next time he pushed down boxes, he did it wrong again. I put an empty skid in the spot where he was pushing the boxes, in hopes of guiding him into the right spot. He put the skid up, then he pushed the boxes into the wrong place. 

It's sort of fun in some ways, though. He's sort of naive about the workplace, having gone to college and not working until he graduated. This leads to some hilarious reactions. For example, when the machine operator on our line flipped off the Facilities Manager, Onions about peed himself out of fear. The operator and that manager were actually really good friends and the type of blue collar people who do that, but it was hilarious to hear Onions say, ""I can't believe you just FLIPPED OFF your BOSS!"" 

One prank we want to pull on Onions has actually been successfully done by our operator before, when he was a measly stager. Our Warehouse Lead was this really extroverted half-black guy (we'll call him Zany), and he was friends with our current operator, Redwood. Redwood was staging for Beelzebub, a quiet guy. Redwood and Zany got the idea to stage a fight in front of Beelzebub where Redwood would end up calling Zany a ""stupid n****r."" When they did it, Beelzebub's eyes shot open, his face immediately flushed red and he suddenly acted VERY interested in the rocks that he was putting into the machines.

There is no real end to this story yet. Onions is gradually improving, but he still has a long way to go. I'm sure that I'll have plenty of other stories about him. Like the time we went out to shoot pool, and he comments about how we weren't playing slop and needed to call combos while literally simultaneously lining up a combo that he didn't call. But, there's one detail about Onions that I haven't mentioned, and it's something about him that brings me great shame. 

Onions only works in my factory because I gave him a referral.",2015-06-05 02:41:39
Making sure people aren't having their money stolen makes me the worst human being ever.,46,380r1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/380r1x/making_sure_people_arent_having_their_money/,6,1433118244.0,"I work as a teller at a rather well known branch in my state. The day this happened, we were rather busy, as we only have three teller windows. To add to this, we are also the drive-through tellers, and have to bounce between customers in the lobby and outside. This Old Lady was in the drive-through. I have a quick glance in the tube before I greet the customers, so I can verify what we're doing.

Me - Welcome, were we just cashing this today?   
OL - *blank stare*   
Me - *seeing another piece of paper* Oh, you're depositing?   
OL - *blank stare*   
Me - *realising it was a post-it* Oh, nevermind, I...   
OL - I JUST WANT IT CASHED

So I go back to my computer, and see we have a cheque for $1,000. But her note is for 3 $100 bills and 2 $50 bills. 

Me - Ma'am, since I'm not familiar with you, and you're cashing for a large amount, would you send through your license for ID?   
OL - *blank stare followed by sigh*   
Me - Thank you so much. Also, I see you only specified for $400, did you not mind how you got the rest back?   
OL - *glaring* WHAT?   
Me - You only specified how you wanted $400 back, so...   
OL - I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS!   
Me - *fed up at this point* I know that ma'am, how did you want to other $600 back, or do you not care?

She confirms she doesn't care about the remainder, sends her license through, and I get her taken care of. At this point the line is growing, and I want her gone.

Me - Ok, that's coming back out, have a great day.   
OL - How do I close my account?   
Me - ... You'll need to come in and speak to someone about it.   
OL - WHAT?!   
Me - You would need to speak with a banker.   
OL - Well, what if I just wrote a cheque out for the full amount and deposited it at another bank? Hm? *smug face*   
Me - You could do that, but there's a difference between a closed account and an empty one. That's just a good way to get hit with fees.   
OL - *starts sputtering and gearing up for a melt down*   
Me - Ok ma'am, have a great day and a fantastic weekend! *mute*

TL;DR: Having an account here doesn't mean I magically know who you are, and it doesn't stop your cheque book from being stolen. You're driving a car, you should have your license, and me asking for it does not make me the scum of the earth. And we don't really care if you take your $1,500 to another bank.

I don't owe you anything! I'm not paying for something I didn't receive!,64,37d80h,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/37d80h/i_dont_owe_you_anything_im_not_paying_for/,13,1432669596.0,"Ok, so I work in a counseling office and due to HIPPAA rules, I am unable to disclose the location or name of the office I work for. Any names have been altered for their protection. 

So I wear many different hats at my job, from doing normal data entry, to working the front desk, call center and even doing billing and collections. The only things I can't do is actually diagnose anyone or sit in on groups as I'm not a counselor or clinician. Every Day, and I do mean EVERY DAY, I have someone or multiple someone's that need to pay their bill and argue with me that they don't owe. On the rare occasion I encounter individuals who have half a brain cell and understand that we provide a service, and yes they have to pay for it. I love these people. I give Discounts to these people. They pay without argument, they smile, they're happy about it and understand that although they are not getting a good (like they would in a grocery store or book store) they are receiving a service for one problem or another. 

Enter Jose. 


I hate this guy. He's in a 2 year Chemical Dependency program. At the beginning of his treatment, we told him clearly that he owed 231.25$ a month, and it was due on the 1st of every month (but we had a leniency that it had to be in by the 15th of the month to avoid a 30$ late fee). He signed a contract to this degree, so he obviously understood it.

Every Month he comes in, and I'm usually at the front desk so I have to ask him for his payment and he argues with me. 

""But, I haven't received anything yet. I'm not paying for something I've never gotten!""

I don't know how many times I've had to tell him that he IS receiving a service from us, and therefore he needs to pay for his group and individual sessions as well as the UA tests that are sent out when he has those sessions with our counselors. After arguing he always ends up paying, but he only pays about 50$ every time, because ""that's all I have. Just take that and be grateful that I'm giving you anything."" This is a Monthly occurrence. And I've told him multiple times that he can pay the 50$, but he'll have a larger balance at the end of his program to pay off before he can be discharged, to which he brushes me off and walks off every time. 


Finally it happened a couple weeks ago. He came in to have his very last session with his counselor and be discharged from the program. I presented him with a bill of 2300$ because the doofus hadn't paid nearly anything towards his program for the whole two years he'd been with us. He'd also accrued late fees because he NEVER paid on time. His face went pale, before it went scarlet with what I can only assume was misguided rage.

""What!? I am not paying this! I never received anything!"" But I was ready for this. I was ready for this idiot to tell me I had to give him a discount, and give him all this for free. So I pulled out the 3 page long invoice of Every Group session he attended, and every Individual session he attended and was getting credit for. 

""Oh.. really? Well then I guess we can let your Parole Officer and Attorney know that you never attended these groups or individual sessions. And if that's the case, then you would certainly be Non-Compliant in your program. Is that correct?""

Being non-compliant can range from having an angry family member at you to jail time. For Jose, it's Jail time. 

Jose was silent. He carefully thumbed through all the pages I handed him and I could see the wheels turning. He stuttered a few curse words, some other words in Spanish that I didn't understand, before reaching for his wallet. He pulled out one bill at a time until it totaled the full amount of 2300$. It was probably the most satisfying moment I've had at work. ",2015-05-26 22:46:36

THC is Apparently... Not a Drug..,53,353k3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/353k3y/thc_is_apparently_not_a_drug/,13,1430944166.0,"Ok, so I originally posted this in Tales from Retail, but was told Rudely by a Mod that it was not appropriate there....so since there is not subreddit called ""Tales from the Counseling Office"", I'm guessing this is the best place for it....


Ok, so this happened to me while I was at work a couple weeks ago. I work in an office that specializes in chemical dependency, alcohol, domestic violence, anger management and mental health counseling. A lot of what we do has to to do with group therapy and individual sessions with counselors for chemical dependency (aka drug use). It's a huge bulk of our clientele, and with that we regularly admit new clients and do a standard urinalysis test to gauge what drugs (if any) are in their systems.


I've worked at this company for nearly 2 years. I've done well over 300 piss tests. I know what is Positive. I know what I'm looking for on the test. It's seriously not difficult. 2 lines is Negative. 1 line is Positive. Plain and Simple. The test we use only looks for 4 main drugs; Methamphetamine (Meth), Cocaine, Opiates and THC (aka, Marijuana, including Medicinal Marijuana).
That being said, I was at the front desk, checking in clients for group and their individual sessions when a new client (NC) had just come out of her evaluation. The counselor who had been speaking with her explained everything that was needed and asked me to do the piss test for her since her next appointment was waiting. It's not my favorite part of the day, and usually I make the counselors do their own piss tests with their clients, but as I had just gotten caught up I put a smile on and said Sure.


I walk this new client out to the UA room just outside the office in the hallway. It's basically a large closet, but it has a sink to wash hands and a small counter to do the necessary paperwork, along with the sticks for the tests and the cups to pee in. I instruct the new client to take the key to the bathroom and a cup and come back when she's finished. She comes back and because they don't pay me enough to touch this stuff, I make the clients hold the sticks in the cup. I go through the same sch-peel every time with every client when I do a piss test.


Me: Are you taking any medications at all? (I'm writing down the ones she says on the test paperwork)


NC: Yeah (blah blah blah)....Oh and I have an Rx for Medicinal Marijuana.


Me: Ok great. I'll just write that down here too. No problem. (My state just legalized Marijuana, so it's really not an issue. We still have to write it down and our tests still test for it regardless, but again, not an issue.)


NC: Ok, but it's not going to make me test positive right?


I pause briefly. Yes... yes it is... But again... not a big deal so I brush it off.


Me: Probably. But because you have a Medicinal Marijuana card, it wont' matter, so don't worry.


NC: Oh, ok. I just don't want to get in trouble because I'm not taking Drugs.


Inwardly I correct her because she obviously is taking drugs, even if they are prescribed to her. It's been a long day, and while I was in a good mood, the stupid is strong with this one, and it's starting to wear on me. When the test comes back positive for THC there's a slightly different procedure with the test. Instead of signing a line that says they agree that they are negative for all substances (just the 4 we were testing for), NC has to sign the line that says they agree that they are Positive for one or more of the substances listed (I checked THC because that's all that came up). Now there's a problem.


NC: Wait a minute... I'm not signing this.


Me: ? It's just standard procedure. You tested positive for THC, which you knew you would because of the Medicinal Marijuana. It's not a big deal, but I need you to sign saying that you agree that that is in your system.


NC: Well I'm not signing this saying that I've taken drugs!


Me: But... Marijuana is a Drug. Just like all the other medications listed here. Like I said though it's ok because you have that card...


NC: Listen, you obviously don't know what your talking about. I'm Not on Drugs!


Defiantly she takes the pen and crosses out the term ""listed Drugs"" on the description above the Positive line and manually writes in ""Medicinal Marijuana"" even though I had Already Written that on the ""Medications Taken"" Section of the same paper. At this point, I've lost all the fucks I had to give and let her. She's signing the stupid thing and that's all that really mattered. It was just an eye opening experience that in all the other 300 piss tests I've administered, 

I:
1: don't know what I'm talking about as far as Drugs are concerned and 2: had no idea that THC was not a drug.......

Reader Calls to Inform Me She Will Ask The Mayor to Make Sure The Newspaper Uses a Larger Photo,45,34s36k,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/34s36k/reader_calls_to_inform_me_she_will_ask_the_mayor/,3,1430705273.0,"Hi all, very new user to Reddit, longtime lurker, first-time poster, etc. Hopefully this is the best place to share this tale.

I work as an assistant editor/graphic designer/writer/sometimes customer service rep at a small weekly newspaper company. Our newspaper published an article on a Vietnam veteran who had a banner installed in the city as part of the city's military heroes banner program. We publish a weekly features piece on every veteran with an installed banner, as it's a series. 

Sometimes we receive photos from the installation ceremony from the city clerk's assistant. Sometimes the photos aren't as great a quality when we receive courtesy photos, but we make due with the content we receive. 

After this article published, an older lady called to complain about the photo we used; it was a photo with several people included and was placed width-wise, already taking up several inches of print space as it was. 

Me: thank you for calling (newspaper), this is fatbabyotters, how may I help you?

Old Lady: I want to talk to your editor.

Me: Yes ma'am, I am an assistant editor, how may I help you?

OL: This photo you used, I don't like it.

Me: Ma'am?


*after several minutes figuring out which edition, which newspaper and which story she was referring to (we publish 6 each week), I was finally able to understand. By now I was annoyed with the amount of my time she was wasting.*


OL: I can't see the faces.

Me: Ma'am, it's a large photo that expands the width of six columns on the front page. The people in the photo are visible and you can even read their names from left to right in the caption.

OL: I still can't see them. You should reprint this and make it bigger.

Me: ma'am, there are no factual fallacies in the article and it will not be reprinted. The photo already takes up several inches to make it clearly visible.

OL: I just don't understand why you people can't do your job and reprint this photo so it's bigger. You take horrible photos.

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry to hear you don't like the photo, but it was a photo we received, not one that a photographer from our newspaper took. It is already quite large and cropped so you can view the subjects' faces. If it were to have been made any larger, the quality would have been blurry.

OL: I will call the mayor, he will make you print better photos. He can do that, you know. I am calling the mayor's office right now.

Me: *(thinking) you do that, I'm sure he'll drop everything to listen to your complaint about a photo you can't see probably due to your own poor eyesight.* yes ma'am, I speak to the mayor every week, I will wait for a call from him on this matter. Is there anything else I can do for you? 

OL: No! *hangs up*


I promptly told the ridiculous complaint to every colleague within earshot. We all had a good laugh. The mayor also laughed when I asked him if he'd recevied her call, which he had, and jokingly ordered me to print better photos.",2015-05-04 05:07:53

So for the past year she's been pestering me to replace her sliding screen doors that lead out onto a back patio. I've repeatedly told her no, because a year ago when I got her new screen doors they mysteriously ended up shredded a week after I had them installed. Of course she has no idea who did this, despite only her and her two sons having access to the unit. 

Two days ago, her son comes storming into my office, interrupting my meeting, and *throws a fucking shredded screen door across the room*. He yells that now I have to replace the screen door because the apartment doesn't have one. Lol okay buddy. It's important to note at this point that there's still a glass door, which is the main insulator against the elements. The screen door is just for summertime. So I'm standing there, absolutely flabbergasted, when he tells me that their toilet is also overflowing and has been doing so for the past hour, and that I needed to come look at this burbling shit-fountain *right now because it's super important, man*.

So I dispatch my superintendent to take a look the clusterfuck that is Elizabeth's apartment, and get back to my meeting.

Stupid prepubescent co-workers,37,345hfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/345hfk/stupid_prepubescent_coworkers/,7,1430228233.0,"Yeah, so I just had my first major WTF moment.

Background: I am German, working at a data center. I consider my english to be quite good, at least when reading/writing.

A few days ago I had to open a ticket describing construction works at our datacenter.
Since we operate world wide at least the title of a ticket must be in english.

So I use a translator (www.leo.org) to get the title right and to make sure that I am not making a stupid mistake.

The title reads: Erection of superstructure

Nice and easy right? I mean, correct me if I´m wrong, but this a is rather normal sentence/expression.

Yeah, no. Germans with VERY limited english knowledge.

Weekly team conference.
""Pfffff, hahaha, erection!""
""Does our erection have a super structure? HAHAHA.""
and. so. on.
Acting like 14 year olds.
I am the youngest. I am 33. Most of them are 40+.

Yeah, I get it, there is only one meaning for ""erection"" in German.
But this is FRIGGIN ENGLISH! And I do read a lot in english and my mind is not constantly in the gutter.

""Hahaha, yeah, no, you´ll have to change the title. Pffffffaahaha!""

Sex. With Carpet.,27,342nh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/342nh4/sex_with_carpet/,4,1430167632.0,"Part two of my new series of Tales (part one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/33pu4o/i_want_a_girl_to_come_over_and_play_monopoly/)) from a job I left a decade ago, where I was a manager of a classified ad section in a weekly community newspaper.

One day, Earl came in. In his 60s, a tall, thin man wearing a dirty t-shirt and shorts. We sat in a conference room and he told me about how he had been a succesful doctor in Arizona. So successful, he said, that the other doctors and hospitals had chased him out of town because he was too good at curing the sick. *Without sick people, they'll go out of business*, he told me. He was hoping to set up shop in my town, to cure everything that ailed everyone. We talked shop, I explained rates and contracts, etc ... and I thought maybe down the road he'd be a client.

Didn't hear from Earl for a while. And then he arrived, once again. He placed a personal ad seeking a woman he'd had a chance encounter with, a woman with *the forehead of a dolphin.* He came in every week thereafter, increasingly agitated, seeking the dolphin headed woman. Each week, I dutifully kept his money, placed his ad, and knew I'd see him next week. (Because really, what woman is going to read the personal ads, see ""Seeking Dolphin Headed Woman"" and think, THAT'S ME, I HAVE TO ANSWER THIS AD!)

Then one week, he came in with a bigger idea. Why pay small amounts of cash for a tiny ad, when he could pay hundreds of dollars for a big print ad in the front of the paper? I set him up in the conference room, as he designed his ad, checking in every few minutes to see if he wanted help, ideas, spell-checking, etc. No, every time. And then he presented his masterpiece. Two ""mug-shot"" type drawings of the dolphin headed woman. One, a profile, the other, a face shot. And a description of their meeting, where she touched his life.

I took his money. His ad ran on the cover page. I enjoyed the commission.

A month passed with nothing from Earl. And then he arrived. *I had an experience with Meth last night. It was like sex ... with carpet* (at this time, he pointed at the floor). He went on to tell me about how it was time for him to leave town, but he wanted to trust me with a set of documents to deliver to the Dolphin Woman.

What was in those documents was madness. A screed that started with a version of the Moses story that involved Egpytian Lesbians teaching him to swim with the crocodiles and feces, through proof that God's punishment to man was to eat feces and how to become true beings we needed to eat gold, to a dozen pages about how the dolphin woman was the reincarnation of God, here to teach Earl to eat gold.

In the early 2000s, I managed the classifieds department of a weekly newspaper. Part of my book of business was ""Adult Services"" (read: Escorts). I had a pretty good group of repeat clients, but revenue is revenue, so on weeks where we had a spot to fill on the page, I'd drop a little ad with my office line in there to entice aspiring escorts to place their ad with me.

One Monday, I came in to see my voicemail light on. (What follows is my slightly fuzzy recollection from more than a decade ago of a transcript of the message. Read this in the voice of a grizzled old man, obviously drunk.)

*Yeah. Hello. Yeah, so I want a girl to come over. Tall, blonde, early 20s. Maybe 30s if she looks young. She don't have to do nothing, just come over, wearing just a rain coat. Nothing but a rain coat. She can come over and change if she wants. I have a rain coat. Two girls. Bring a friend. A blonde and a brunnette.

So I guess that something people do,32,33knsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/33knsb/so_i_guess_that_something_people_do/,5,1429776493.0,"Been lurking for a while and I figure this sub would be the best place for me to share this narrative. A little backstory. A few years ago I worked a part time second job for the county’s medical examiner’s office for a little extra cash. It was my job to pick up dead bodies either from hospitals or from where they died and transport them to the ME’s office. I have many, MANY stories but I figured I would share my most memorable. On hospital calls we would transport solo. On home pickups we always had a partner. This instance is of the later variety.  He doesn’t add anything to this story, but he does in others I may tell. 

Its my first night on the job. We get a call from dispatch to collect a body we head to the address and talk with the cops on scene. (Side note: every death scene will have police officers and a death investigator from the ME’s office.) Their only words are “HA. He’s all yours guys”. Awesome….

So we head on up to the second floor apt of a duplex. Door opens directly into a kitchen. We wait in the kitchen for the death investigator to do his thing. In the meantime we take in the sites of the room. Harley-Davidson. Everything is emblazoned with Harley. Pictures on the fridge are of his Harley, him on a Harley, some girls on a Harley, etc. Alrighty. Whatever. People have their own interests. So the doorway from the kitchen to the living room has sleeping bag stapled above it to act as some kind of curtain. Again, whatever. Not my place, people can live how they want I suppose. So we make into the living room which is where the man collapsed on the floor and died. I have no idea what from, its not my job to know. Me and my partner are taking in the scene while the DI does his thing. Now this room is where things get weird. On one of the end tables is a pile of pot, some rolled joints and some cocaine. Cops are busy bagging everything up while we wait. Next let me describe this gentleman. He is naked from the waist down (which is oddly common among the dead) and wearing a Harley t-shirt. Ohh and how I wish that’s all. On top of that he is wearing a pink negligee, pink thigh high stockings, and makeup. We move him to start the transport and we find the matching pink high heels underneath. If that wasn’t enough of a show, the room has about 20 didoes scattered across it. About 10 in a tool bag next to the TV and one suction cupped to the coffee table with dried shit still on it. What a great day my first was turning into. That was only my third pickup of six that night.

I will never be able to, for as long as I live, remove the image of that pickup from my head.

III: Legislative Laziness,9,33ef0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/33ef0b/iii_legislative_laziness/,2,1429650978.0,"“We need a goal,” he said with a disgruntled look on his face. This was him, my official, addressing myself and my other two co-staffers in the office today. My Chief of Staff, ever the man of action and arguably the most important man in this entire puzzle, was out of the office. I think it was a meeting, but he was most likely trying to decompress from all the stress he’s been under lately. As I said before- he tries to move the world by himself, and doesn't let anyone try to help him. I personally think it’s because he doesn't want anyone to bear his burdens, but I also think it could equally be his work ethic makes him too proud of the burden itself to lighten it at all. Whatever the case may be, the only person in the office worth their weight in gold was out, and here we were, staring the man without goals in the face as he told us “we need a goal.” 

In many dictionaries, a goal is defined as a sort of milestone someone would want to achieve. To have a goal itself is to imply ambition, drive, or some sort of work ethic. Antonym: laziness. 

The usage of the word “goals” is also a funny thing for a person who absconds from having them in the first place. For some people with my boss’ job, they’d set goals. A great many might even set the goal to be submitting bills, or maybe getting a reform passed. Possibly you might suggest that they set the goal to be to help over 1,000 constituents in a single term or less. It would also be honorable to think that a good goal would be to try and work behind the scenes of politics itself to move the wheels just *that* much faster. 

My boss’ goal?

Not too sure. He wants to be an ambassador to some country. He also wants to do stuff for education. Jokes on him though- he’s already past the prime, and then some, of his life. He has literally no political power, because he never had any ambition to get any, and all he has is seniority in the state legislature, which is of itself hilarious because everyone in the know itself knows that he’s someone who votes whatever way he thinks looks politically the best. This is used to great effect by his party superiors, so I’d wager. The education thing is a joke too. If he was genuinely interested, he’d actually try. He’d get into the more closed political circles- he’d rub shoulders with the movers and shakers. Hell, he’d *become* one of those sort of people. 

But we’re here to talk about goals. 

Goals. Funny things. Good things to have, if you do. If you don’t, sometimes you float by. Sometimes you can ride the waves of others, like a surfer over a vortex of deep blue. If you are particularly good at clutching coattails, you may appear to have satisfied faux-goals; ones that you set, or are at least saying you set while sitting in a press conference while in reality you made up those goals just now to make it seem like you achieved something.

Signing onto a bill, for example, is a good way to say you achieved one of your “goals” when it comes time to grab some glory. That way, when it’s passed, and you no longer have to worry about it (as if you did in the first place), you can roll up to any constituent and say that not only did you vote in favor of it, but you *helped* to pass it. Although in reality, no work was done by you, no work really was ever thought of by you at all, and instead you may simply staple yourself onto the backs of others. You now look like you did something.

Now, you've achieved your goal. Now, your constituents realize something- you’re a leader.
You can move mountains.
You can make things happen.
You can produce.
You can meet your goals. 
You are a mover and a shaker.

And now, you have their vote. 

Goals… If your only goal is to get re-elected, you can pretend you have a lot of goals. Boy, you can pretend to have the most important goals in the land. Then, when none of them come through, and because you already had so little (see: nothing) invested in the first place, it’s so easy to drop them that you can avoid any scandal. But any successes…. 

Well, it’s like fishing. 

You have to find a worm first. Remember to dig where it’s moist- where it’s been raining. Somewhere the clouds have given a lot of attention. Find a big one. Find something that will attract a lot of fish. Make sure your hook is sharp- you want to be able to pierce that fish’s mouth. But not too sharp, otherwise you might cut right through it and the worm could fall off. Stick your hook into the worm. Live ones are best, as they dance with it. Fish get attracted. Bites happen; small at first, then a few, big crunches. I feel bad for the worm at this point, but that’s it’s job. Pull when you feel a tug. That hook has a job to do too, and so does the fish- but it’s just not conscious of it yet. Pull hard, now. Reel fast, then slow, then fast again to make sure you don’t stress the fish out. Work with the motions. Let it jiggle on the line- make a few waves here and there. Once you pull it out, you become god. It’s gills; now cemented together outside of the watery, self-suspending environment, are useless here. It can’t breathe, but you got the prize. Unhook it, and throw it in the cooler. Get it stuffed, and mount it. It’ll be a nice trophy over the fireplace, next to all the other ones. ",2015-04-22 00:16:18

They told me ""Oh, it doesn't matter. As long as it looks clean, the customer won't care. So just use whatever."" At the moment, I felt I had no choice but to oblige. Who was I to question my new employer and risk my job?

However, the following day I had off and I couldn't stop feeling so wrong about it. We only wipe things down. We don't clean. We're paid to clean and we don't. It was gross what they considered cleaning.

I explain to her that they will be outside and in the evening.  She never elaborated on why she was asking or any of the normal conversational things you might do to get someone to understand your point of view. 

So now, I ask you. Do people put on fireworks indoors? Around a 3k+ crowd? In the summer?

Vendetta against V,38,316kdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/316kdy/vendetta_against_v/,3,1427975576.0,"As I’ve outlined in my [previous post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/311shf/the_meeting_of_the_fire_chiefs/) about *Contract Publishing Company*, where I work, the sales staff have few scruples. The worst one is undoubtedly a man (in the loosest sense of the term) who we’ll call V. Words I would use to describe his personality include ‘abrasive’, ‘greedy’, ‘idiotic’ and ‘careless’.

For example, when sales reps sell an advert into one of our publications, they’ll also typically include a half page or full page of commercial advertorial (an article that looks like a regular article but is actually paid content) for free, as a sweetener. Unfortunately, when V makes a note of this generosity on our internal systems he often forgets to tell the client, which can make for some embarrassing or awkward moments when they haven’t got a clue what I’m talking about.

I’ve quietly nicknamed him the Penguin, because he looks exactly like Danny DeVito’s character in Batman Returns - balding head and scraggly hair, harsh, grating voice and a huge beer belly that wobbles when he walks. His favourite thing to do in the office is nap, and at lunchtime he’ll recline on his chair and start snoring. His shirt buttons don’t always remain closed. He’s also got tonnes of money and a big Mercedes jeep yet he apparently doesn’t have access to a shower or soap. What makes it worse is that he thinks he’s some sort of player, and gets very handsy with female co-workers. One girl in particular, who is about 23 and more than half his age, is the recipient of a number of gifts that she finds very creepy, and immediately gives them away. He’s also married, with children, however that happened.

These are some of his highlights:

In the past V has promised field interviews for half page commercial profiles (consisting of only 250 words), has sold cover stories [yes, some of our larger magazines have cover stories that are sold to a particular client, meaning there tends to be some repetition involving companies with deeper pockets] that have already been sold by other sales reps, and then he fights until he gets his way. V usually gets his way because his regular clients are among some of my country’s biggest businesses. If he goes, he takes tens of thousands of euro in sales revenue with him, probably more.

Voice impersonations are a large part of V’s repertoire. One of the most famed stories about him around the office is that of a client who was becoming more and more impatient with V and his manner, and hung up on him. V immediately called back, put on an accent, and attempted to sell the ad again. The client knew who it was straight away, and hung up once more. 

The worst story I heard about V only happened a few weeks back. Several staff members attended the funeral of the mother of one of our senior sales staff; our boss, heads of design and editorial, and V. V travelled to the funeral in his big 4x4 with several young members of our Events division, who obviously couldn’t get a lift with anyone else. When they arrived, V pulled in behind another car that happened to belong to our design director, J, who was retrieving an umbrella from the boot (trunk for you American folk) as V arrived. V began inching towards her, smiling away, pretending to trap her. But where normal people would stop, V kept going and eventually pinned J to the boot of her own car. J was pounding on the bonnet (hood) of his 4x4, screaming at him to back up, the Events team in the back of V’s Mercedes were screaming at him to back up and all the while V was nodding and smiling, having a great time. Eventually he backed up and got out, and couldn’t  understand why everyone was so mad at him. For a relatively accurate graphical representation of the inner working's of V's thought processes, please see [here] (https://img1.etsystatic.com/014/1/8195938/il_fullxfull.465378139_8tih.jpg).

V didn’t even apologise until he realised J was ignoring his cheery greetings in the office, and was continually blanking his design requests. When she pointed out exactly why she was annoyed (understatement of the year) with him, he tried to deny any wrongdoing. But J was having none of it and eventually made him apologise in front of the entire sales floor, and he disappeared back to his pen with a very red face. In my opinion, J should have made use of a thick wooden stick in getting the point across. To each their own.

J’s back is also quite sore since it happened, and apparently she’s going to find out what’s wrong and maybe pursue him for it. One can only hope.

The meeting of the fire chiefs,23,311shf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/311shf/the_meeting_of_the_fire_chiefs/,3,1427892046.0,"A little set-up is required for this tale. I work as a staff editor for one of the largest contract publishing companies in my home country. We mainly produce magazines or yearbooks specifically requested by clients, which will be distributed to members or customers rather than sold on shelves.

At the helm of *Contract Publishing Company* is our boss, Glorious Leader, a former salesperson who appears to have zero understanding of editorial, design or tact. What he does understand are sales, and the fact that the more ads they sell, the more money finds its way into his pocket, and so the Sales department is deemed to be the most important. Not Editorial (who actually write each publication and guide it to print), not Design (who create masterpieces from shit specifications), but Sales. The former are considered useful on certain occasions, but not indispensable.

As a result they’re given almost free rein and routinely ignore client requests about certain ads not appearing in their publication, or go on selling frenzies and transform titles with great potential into magazines chock full of often unrelated ads. Deadlines have essentially become nonexistent and in my time here I’ve had approximately two publications go to print on time. The rest are always held up because Glorious Leader sanctions the selling of more ads, despite having promised the client personally that we will deliver by a certain time. Cue unpleasantness between each editor and the client, as they wonder why their publication hasn’t gone to print yet. 

Unfortunately, even the more human sales reps are prone to this sort of irritating behaviour. One of these is someone I work with on a semi-regular basis: D. 

D is a lower-level salesperson who sells ads for our smaller titles, including one of mine that focuses on our city’s fire service. The client is a high-level officer in the fire service and while it’s not an official publication, we still have invaluable access to fire service personnel and stations across the city. One day I get a call from this client. We’ll refer to him as G.

>G: Hey, I have a new story for you, here’s the details. Oh, and we have a fairly serious issue involving your company that I need to talk to you about.

>Me, obviously a little taken aback: Oh? Ok, what is it?

>G: Well, we attended a fire at a university apartment complex a few weeks back, and we recently got a call from them. Apparently D from your organisation called them and pretended to work for the fire service. He told them all about the magazine you do and asked if they would like to support it with an ad, considering the great work the fire service did in saving their building. Then he told them they needed to make a quick decision as he was meeting the ‘fire chiefs’ later to discuss this. They have a recording of this conversation.

**[Aside: the fire service in my city has one fire chief, not several. Despite the fact that D has worked on this publication for a number of years, he still doesn’t know enough about the fire service to create a more believable lie].**

I don’t say anything for about ten seconds. I’m gobsmacked, really. Sales staff have pulled some pretty fast moves in the past, but I’ve only heard about those in stories. Now it’s happening to me.

>Me: Uh...let me pass this onto my editorial manager (ED) and out head of sales (HS) and we’ll get this sorted.

>G: Ok, thanks. Just so you know, I haven’t passed this higher up the chain. If the fire chief found out he’d immediately stop access to the stations and personnel, and the magazine would be finished.

I duly passed it on. Glorious Leader, ED and HS all sat in on a conference call with G several days later, and the recording was played. ED pulled me aside after and told me how embarrassing it was. Even Glorious Leader cringed, and if he has a moral compass then I’m a banana. In the end it was all resolved, D was given a strong warning and the client was satisfied. Whether it’ll sink in for D, however, is another story.

II: The Emails,69,30ucg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/30ucg7/ii_the_emails/,22,1427745323.0,"

When I started working here, and by that I mean being paid actual money to show up instead of showing up randomly as an intern for a day or two, I started by doing emails. It wasn’t like I’d write emails to important people or change lives through my writing. What I would do, and still do, is read them. Every day. I’d log into Outlook under my official’s credentials, go through his inbox, and read the hundreds of unopened emails we get every day. All of the complaints sent in by constituents- all the requests for new legislation, asking for his support for this bill or that resolution, would be ignored by everyone. Everyone but me. It was my job to read them, file them away, and try to reply back in the voice and opinion of my state representative. 

There are a lot of these. They’re sent in by computers, really, so technically they don’t count as constituent emails per se, but the websites that send them are political organizations which people sign into and give permission to use their name when sending letters asking for support or opposition of laws in the state. So although they’re almost always the same, generic, walls of text that no one cares about, they’re always recognizable as inhuman. And we get these. Every day. 90% of the emails in the inbox every day are these. 

Sure, we get emails from constituents that are written out carefully, with time taken to make them personal and seemingly intimate. “I voted for you last cycle, and I did this year as well” some read. It’s nice to show support. Others simply say “I vote and I will remember your decision on this!”, warning the elected official, supposing he read them, of course, of the impending retribution he will face should he not abandon all previous positions in favor of this one single issue. 

Here's the fun part- I have to reply to these emails. The grand irony of this all is that every single email, from the Governor right down to the constituent farmer who lives in Bumshart, Nebrahoma (Credit: The Oatmeal), is addressed to my elected official. He will never see them. He hasn't opened his email in around three or more years. I think the one time he did was the day after it was given to him by the state after he won his first election. Since then he waves it off like it's a bag of toxic waste. 

Now when I reply to these emails, I have to not only form an opinion on behalf of my boss, but I now also have to *sound* like him. The trouble is how do you reply to an email in the voice of a condescending asshole without coming off as an asshole in the first place? 

There is a light at the end of this torturous tunnel. Thankfully, all of these constituent emails and issues are filed immediately into a tidy little folder never to be seen again, titled ""Handled"". Job done. 

So at the end of every day, I look at my pristine work inbox, now cleared, and realize, that many people today have contacted an elected official of the State gov't with hopes of getting their point across to the man they were told would listen to them and weigh their opinions when voting in the legislature. I regret the lie that I have to tell many people- in his name- that *I thank them* for contacting *my* office, and for giving me their opinion. ""I'll"" be sure to think of it when I'm voting next. 

Noticing my few hours are up in the day, I close Outlook, log off the state computer, turn it off, and head home. This process repeats every day. My chief of staff looks at the inbox the next day, pats me on the back and says ""good job in keeping it clean.""

I: Years in the Making (Xpost /r/talesfromtheoffice),30,306ttn,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/306ttn/i_years_in_the_making_xpost_rtalesfromtheoffice/,3,1427238578.0,"I've been working for this government now for a few years. Started as an intern, and before that a campaigner on the trail of a candidate or two. That was back in highschool. I was still somewhat hopeful, and in turn interested in politics. However interesting my life was back then, I consider the more recent years to be some of the more... humorous ones, to say the least. 

The life of a civil servant isn't easy. It's filled with trials and tribulations; a constituent is stuck in a life-threatening bureaucratic paper loop, or a local's Social Services paperwork didn't go through and now they might be stripped of their medication, and a local charity stopped half-way through paying some guy's bills and now he needs help before he becomes homeless. It's our job to help those kinds of people.

So I imagined, three years ago when I signed my name on a slip of creamy light-khaki colored paper that told me to swear to protect and preserve the Constitution of this state. So I have experienced, anyway, once or twice. Although we don't really get that many cases in my office specifically, we do get them once in a blue moon. The time in between those long, dreary, weeks-long stints of boredom and hypocritical ""civil service"" is spent doing other things. Reddit is popular between my coworker and I, while my Chief of Staff attempts to fix the world and doesn't let us help. He's got a great work ethic, but sometimes it isolates him. 

The office itself is sort of an indicator of our productive output to society. The white-washed walls, now slightly darker due to a rooftop heater expelling black snowflakes of carbon everywhere, smearing black streaks and cracks throughout, encase a small area of roughly 30 square feet. A long, black, rubberized carpet leads from the doorway to the front divider, behind which sits my fellow Redditor. The carpet was supposed to keep the floor generally clean from the assaults of salt and gravel used by the highway department outside. Success has been varied. People rarely come in to warrant having it in the first place. Fluorescent lights indiscriminately illuminate the room, throwing harsh white light over files which haven't moved in an unknown amount of time.  

A single, long, equally as bland corridor stretches the length of the office. The first door, encountered immediately as you begin the trek to the back room, is *the* office. His office. My boss' office. It's small, relatively speaking. Elected officials usually have more spacious rooms, fitted out in all the decorations and rights of splendor which would present an air of authority and governing tradition to those who enter. This all is enforced by the fact that the couch, angled to face the door, forces you by the way it's positioned to awkwardly angle your head towards a large desk, pitted against the opposite wall and arguably taking up the other half of the already claustrophobic room. That's *His* desk. So it says in the paperwork, anyway. The last time he used it was... I can't even remember. I've used it more times than he has. It's great for napping in. A single, lonely portrait of JFK lingers near the corner of it, by the wall. It has the most melancholy expression

Further down, by about three feet, is another door on the left. The conference room. It's just a conference room. Lit by the same fluorescent lights, stuffing the room with an awkward, immature lighting which reduces any meeting to an almost impolite silence with their intensity. The large, needlessly expensive granite long table is encircled by a number of executive chairs. Each is identical, with the same ass imprint engraved into the depressed seating foam as the one next to it. 

At the end of the hall is a single store room. We technically don't own it. It's donated by the owner of the building. Because of this loophole, we keep all of our election material in there. Legal, but sketchy. The weird-smelling microwave, decrepit minifridge, and pile of assorted plastic silverware is also in there as well. The cleaning crew somehow managed to make that room spotless, while the rest of the office walls are stained black from the soot. 

And this is the place I work. Five days a week, and now four because of my college classes, I've been coming here for between 3 to four hours a day. I've done this now for three years, and I've grown to appreciate the finer things of government work. I've helped with presidential elections, congressional runs, county legislature campaigns, and State Legislature bids, but nothing prepared me for the irony that is the hypocritical work I don't do on a daily basis. I'll post more, but for those wondering- I'll be chronicling the hypocrisy of my State Legislature office through this account. I've had an itch to begin writing them since last year, and since I'm leaving in five months due to transferring to a four-year university from the one I'm currently in, I think now's a good time. These are the tales from my office.

Time to GTFO...,31,2zjphv,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2zjphv/time_to_gtfo/,6,1426734831.0,"Little bit of a rant this time about my employer. 

I work for a family run electronics chain. I ""run"" the cell phone department (basically the manager, but without the title). I've been in this position for close to 3 years. I got this position through a friend, who was the cell phone department manager at the time. 

There is one guy at this particular store that is pretty much untouchable. He is the typical ""sleazy sales guy"" and is usually one of the top sales guys of the entire company, which puts him on the map with the big boss. We shall call him DB (douchebag for short). 

In the time I have been employed with this company, I have witnessed DB, shout, threaten, intimidate, harass, bully AND physically throw a punch at employees (he had to take anger management classes for the punch. It never actually connected). This guy also steals sales. As we are commissioned, it's a pretty big deal for the person that loses the sale. I've personally lost $10,000 gross profit deals (we get 25% of gp). Management ignores it and makes provisions for DB. I've even been told that everyone else BUT him are replaceable. 

I have seen 4 people leave the company because they cannot work with DB. 2 of them were hired after me, 1 was the previous store manager! I have spoken to clients that refuse to shop our store after buying from him. This week I overheard him complaining to a coworker that he should have ""charged more"" for a certain TV as it was worth way more than $1000. He sold it to a little old lady, who for some reason, loves the guy. If only she knew!

Fast forward to last month. Big boss visits our store (will call him BDB for bigger douche bag). Decides to ""have a chat"" since the cell department isn't making him enough money (mainly because he cut back on the cell department's commission 6 months ago, but hey, that shouldn't matter...). Until last month, DB was not permitted to go near cell or satelitte sales as he's, well, an idiot and would screw up the contracts. So BDB in his infinite wisdom, decides that DB can ""pre-sell"" to a client and expect a cut from the sales person he sends the client to. Basically giving DB more money for less work and forcing me (sucker) to do it with a smile. BDB also hired an extra person for the cell department so the pie could be split even thinner than it already is. 

Fast forward to this month. Note this is the 6th. DB has been passing deals to the newbie, knowing that the newbie will just gladly pass him his cut, but newbie doesn't KNOW how to actually do the job, so newbie comes to me for help. DB has already claimed his percentage, so in our pos, we can split things to 2 people. So now, I do ALL the work, for free! Newbie is currently sitting pretty at $450+ while I'm sat at $45. Go figure. Guess I should ""up my game eh?"". 

DB continues to give these deals to my coworkers while I'm sat at the desk, basically sitting on facebook thinking ""f**k you!"". Am I bitter? Damn right! I have been treated like cr@p with this company from this guy, the store manager and upper management for a long time. I have been insulted in front of clients. Have had my disability blatantly made aware of TO clients (I have a fake eye, which usually doesn't get noticed). I have been manipulated into handing over deals to DB, repeatedly. Been told I can ONLY sell cell phones while EVERYONE else can sell anything. The list is on-going.

To quote Milton... ""I'm gonna burn this place down!""


Thanks for listening. Feels a little better.",2015-03-19 05:13:51
"Been at a new job for 3 days, and the boss has a ""team building"" meeting...",43,2y0t3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2y0t3e/been_at_a_new_job_for_3_days_and_the_boss_has_a/,2,1425564758.0,"...at least that's what the meeting request says.  I get there, there are cookies and coffee and all of my new team, about half of whom I've met.  The boss who hired me comes in and closes the door.  She proceeds to explain how her boss has given her a terrible performance appraisal.  She makes several points about how she has been accused of unreasonable demands, poor communication, using charge accounts as punishment, and insulting her team in public.  There is nothing but silence in the room.  She says she is going to leave the room for 20 minutes and that when she comes back, we should have solutions to this problem.  So she leaves and closes the door behind her.  After about 30 seconds of silence, I say ""Wow, that was uncomfortable.""  The lead engineer says, ""Welcome to the team.""

So there is a relative consensus in the room after about 10 minutes that it has gotten better over the last 6 months.  But that there is still a communication issue.  She keeps priorities to herself, and when they shift, there is no explanation offered.

The conversation degrades after that, but it seems there is way too much nervous laughter.

She comes back and almost immediately someone tells her it has gotten better over the last 6 months.  She is happy to hear it.  After some more awkward conversation, the lead tells her, in a very round about way that she needs to delegate more of the priority setting to team members.  She responds with, ""But how am I going to do that?""  And waits for the answer.  I'm thinking, well duh, you give up some authority, but it sounds like you don't do that.  More awkward conversation, but nothing of substance.

**TLDR;** The parallels to an abusive spousal relationship are uncanny.

Any way for me, I'm stuck in this new team for some time.  I'm over 30 years into my career, so I think I can handle this, but wow, that was a interesting introduction to a new job.",2015-03-05 16:12:38

----------------------------------------------

So, at this point - I'm on my way out, and I have no fucks to give. So GeekEng and I decide to pull our picture prank, and don't care if it pisses anyone off. From last time:

>Well, we decided to change that, and ASAP. We hatched a plan to replace every single picture in the office on anyone's desk with a picture of myself and/or GeekEng recreating the picture - Just to see what kind of reaction we'd get. But, we would have to wait until no one was in the office - We didn't want anyone to know about it, and wanted to see how long everyone took to catch on.

So, we decide to pull it off in the office once everyone leaves, print them right there, and just replace all the pictures in 1 night. We waited til the last person left the office (about 7:30, go figure) and got to work. When it was finished, we had a few pretty damn good pieces of work. QuietGirl's engagement photo? Imagine ex-con looking me being the little spoon, embraced from behind by a portly bearded man, with creepy/loving smiles towards the camera. It only got better from there. Pregnancy announcement cards, wedding photos, children's yuppy glamour shots, nothing was sacred. We finished and headed home around 10pm. Totally worth it. 

The next morning, I show up at 8:30, and the reaction is golden. Most people are absolutely laughing their asses off. They're taking the pictures and showing each other, etc. Well, most people are. The managers? They're quietly sitting at the desks. They had all quietly taken the pictures and thrown them away. Time for work, people..

--------------------------------------------

So, they're at their last ditch attempt to get me to submit working 45+ hours per week minimum, and they need a plan. They got it! They'll write me up! This is going to go over great!

So, Next week in the office, I get a meeting invite. It's me, Dumb-As-A-Post, CBA, and HRGuy. Like this isn't obvious. I am told that because I'm not getting my 50+ hours a week of work done, and because of my attendance problems, they're going to implement a Performance Improvement Plan. PIP, for short. 

Things are always more fun when you use an acronym.

So, now there's more of a paperwork trail to detail my refusal to do my job. You know, because I wasn't told what the job entailed in the interview. That's my story, at least. Their story is that I'm a shitty employee. 

*Side Note - PIPs and the like are almost always a method used by companies to create a paper trail for people they want to get rid of - It covers their ass in the way of unemployment, since they don't want to pay it, and their unemployment insurance goes up if they do. Most of the time, If you get put on one of these, and you haven't been getting along with people at your job, update your resume.*

-------------------------------------------------------

In the meantime, I have met with my future manager, and am just waiting on HR at [EnergyCo] to put the paperwork through on the new job. This would end up taking about 1 1/2 months, because they're lazy as fuck. More on that in the next series.

So I know I'm getting my new job, and am just playing the waiting game. Every week, I go to our little PIP meeting, where I get told I need to work extra hours, and I sit there silently thinking, *""The fuck I do, I'm dropping every project I'm on in your hands and walking out the second that I can.""*

----------------------------------------------

So, after 5 or 6 of these weekly meetings where they would say something along the lines of, ""You're not improving.""

and I would think something along the lines of, ""You'd think you'd be smart enough to realize by now I'm not going to do what you want me to."", we were at wits end with each other. They needed someone to go on a fast 2 day trip to a cheese plant in New Mexico, and decided that my life was less important than the other engineers, so I was chosen to go, with 1 day's notice. Ironically, I was offered the job at [EnergyCo] the afternoon before I left for NM, and my PIP meeting was scheduled for Friday at 5 pm. Hmmm - that's a bit too obvious, fellas.

Now, I could've just up and quit, and not shown up for the airplane (the company had it's own airplane - Nice for situations like this), but that would've been the obvious move. No, we'll play the long game. I was getting a free 2 day trip to NM out of this.

So, the next morning I get up, and head over to the airport. I was in a pretty chipper mode, understandably at this point. I started to type out a resignation email, but all I could seem to muster without losing focus was, *""Fuck you guys, I'm out.""*

By the end of the plane ride to NM, I'd gotten it typed out. The airport had wifi, so I sent that bitch off and closed Microsoft Outlook. I'd let em sweat it out for the rest of the day. I then called GeekEng once we got to the plant, and let him in on the knowledge. I called another friend at work, one of the IT guys, and let him know too. He said he'd seen some weird stuff come across his desk as well - He wasn't told why, but they needed him to stay til 6 on Friday. Apparently, they didn't want me even having the possibility of access once I was let go. I told him now that he probably wasn't going to need to worry about staying late. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

Now, I set about getting my shit done for the next 2 days. In about 5 hours, I had everything done that I needed to for the 2 days, but of course I normally would have to act busy since I wouldn't be able to leave, and didn't want to look lazy. However, this time was different, because I didn't care what they thought now. So I strolled over to the electricians' work trailer to see what they were up to. 

The foreman was in there, talking about how the project was going to unfold. I started zoning out, and snapped back when I heard, ""and /u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 will be taking this over and running with it.""

My response?

*""Nope.""*

Cue foreman's confused look while he says, ""Yeah, you were assigned this now. It's yours.""

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Well, that may be the case, but I'm not going to do it.""* I wanted to drag this out a bit.

Foreman - *""Why can I ask?""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Yeah. I quit today. I'm done in 2 weeks.""*

What followed was a rant by the foreman about how no one in the Engineering sector stuck around to finish projects, that this was the 3rd engineer assigned to this project and how now it was going to take longer to get the design done, etc, etc. - I just smirked. 

The team of electricians on the project - 4 of them - were a bit miffed, to say the least. I walked up to one that I'd worked with before.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Hey, I'll buy you guys a couple rounds tonight to make up for it. My bad dude.""*

And that solved that.So, the day moves on I bum around the plant (side note - cheese plants are clean as fuck), and we leave to head to dinner. I completely forget where we ate - along with pretty much everything else that night. What I do remember is heading to the ""bar"" with the electricians. Apparently, there's some weird law about bars in NM, which makes Applebee's the night place to be - I'm not kidding. Picture the middle bar area empty of chairs, with young'uns grinding on each other to dubstep, while right over the wall is a WASP family of 4 eating their bourbon street steak and chicken fingers. It was surreal.

So all 5 of us grab a table and start drinking beer. It doesn't take them long to ask why I quit. I tell them what I've told everyone here only the 5 minute version, and they aren't surprised at all. They say that's what every new engineer seems to do at [Company]. I figured as much, but it was interesting information nonetheless. 

---------------------------------------

So the waitress came around again, and I ordered a shot of Patron for everyone.

Electrician 1 - *""Dude, you don't need to do that. We don't care that the project is getting reassigned, really.""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""What do you mean? I ain't paying for this shit. It's going on the company card.""*

It simultaneously dawned on all 5 electricians what I was doing. The waitress came up with the shots, and I just said, ""Add it to the tab.""

Electrician 1 ordered another round, and the waitress said, ""Sorry, we aren't allowed to put one drink in front of you until your current one is finished.""

We all looked at each other, down the shot, and Electrician 2 said, ""Just keep looping around with more shots. We'll let you know when we're done.""

Then I woke up with one of the worst hangovers I've had in my entire life. I'm pretty sure the only reason I woke up was because the foreman was pounding on my door, which matched the pounding in my head, jarring my to consciousness. I stumbled over to the door, opened it, muttered ""I'm not making it in. Come get me at lunch."" closed the door, and puked all over the bathtub.

------------------------------------

By the time I got back to the office the next day, the story had already made its rounds. It was epic, when compared to anything that had ever happened at that company, from what I hear. All I'd done is quit and then go out that night on the company card. In all fairness, I'm told the bill was over $700. I don;t know, because although I signed it, I don't recall ever seeing a receipt. Oh well. I remember trying to take the waitress home, failing miserably, getting in the truck, and that's about it.

I have a meeting about 4 pm with CBA, and he starts peppering me with questions, about New Mexico, then about my other projects as well. I can see where this is going, so I just play dumb. I don't know the status on anything, I don't know what's been ordered, I don't know what designs have been completed. You want that info? Read my email.

At the end of the day, I was called into Dumb-As-A-Post's office, for what I assume was going to be a reaming. Instead, it was decided that I would be paid for my full 2 weeks' notice, but they didn't want me coming into the office anymore. I signed some papers, cleaned up my desk, and had 2 weeks' paid vacation on top of my banked vacation pay before I started my new job. I'm told that to cover for me not giving CBA any info on my current projects, he killed it on overtime for 3 weeks straight to get caught back up to where I was. Serves him right.

--------------------------------

**Epilogue**

GeekEng - He still works there to this day. He's going to get his P.E. license with them (they pay for all of it) and then start looking for a new job.

QuietGirl - Quit about 6 months after I did to go back and work for her parents at their cabinet shop. I told you she wouldn't last long. The pretty funny part was that her friend from school started there before QuietGirl left - after QuietGirl left, her friend left, too - to join the seminary... You know a job is bad if they leave to be a nun.

The other engineer that was under CBA with me quit about 6 months ago, and now works at [EnergyCo]. [Company] is hemorrhaging engineers like nobody's business.

HRGuy has moved to a different division, but is still there. I did my exit interview with him, and was told later that Dumb-As-A-Post was in complete denial mode about it - the hours aren't what are driving people away, it's the town - If they could just find people that wanted to move there, it'd be fine.

CBA - still works there. Still an asshole. I heard rumors of him being demoted, but I'm not 100% clear on that yet.

Dumb-As-A-Post - still reading self hell books, and trying to shoehorn them into others' lives as well. I've heard the other divisions want him gone, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.

**Sorry this didn't flow as well as the rest, I'm in a hurry to tell you guys the next story about how I got fucked over and fucked up my job at [EnergyCo] now. It's like I just don't learn that good... I'll get started on that one soon.**",2015-02-27 10:23:02

-------------------------------------------------------------

My non-passive-aggressive attitude wasn't getting me anywhere. Of course, this didn't matter to me, because I didn't want to work there anyways - I didn't see myself there for more than another few months while I searched out a new/better job.

So, time to update the resume. My first stop was GeekEng, to see if he knew of any job openings in the area. He didn't, but the drafter in his group did - it was a position at a company he used to work at. He gave me his old manager's number, and I gave him a call and set up a time for lunch. With a bit of my stress lifted for the day, I went over and shot the shit with GeekEng for a bit. We talked a bit about how the atmosphere was dead in the office, as always - no joking, no fun. 

[Scarily accurate depicition of Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjJCdCXFslY) 

Well, we decided to change that, and ASAP. We hatched a plan to replace *every single* picture in the office on anyone's desk with a picture of myself and/or GeekEng recreating the picture - Just to see what kind of reaction we'd get. But, we would have to wait until no one was in the office - We didn't want anyone to know about it, and wanted to see how long everyone took to catch on. *Edit - This will be described in the next writing.*

In the meantime, Dumb-As-A-Post and CBA (Competent But Asshole) decided that I needed to be ""educated"" on what being an engineer meant. They seemed to think if I was just shown that people who work 60 hours a week get more out of work, I'd want to do that too. That was wrong, but it didn't stop them from trying.

Their first attempt was to have a meeting for all the engineers that discussed ""Time Management Strategies"". I was really tempted to decline the meeting and say ""I don't have the time to attend this."", but as they had put HRGuy in the middle of this and had him conduct the ""meeting"", I didn't want to put him on the spot. So, like a good little employee, I went to the meeting. Of course, there was another self help book that was required reading beforehand, but I skipped that. Once in the meeting, you could tell that it was geared towards me and thinly veiled to be a meeting for ""everyone"". HRGuy had a piece of paper he kept reading from, and the questions seemed to come straight from Dumb-As-A-Post.

HRGuy - *""So what strategies do you use to organize your work?""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - .......

and on. The one great response I had that didn't just play the game went as such:

HRGuy - *""So what do you do when you find that you can't finish the work you have in a given week?""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""I go home.""*

Both QuietGirl and HRGuy fidget uncomfortably in their seats. GeekEng smirks.

HRGuy - *""But what do you do to finish the work that was scheduled for that previous week?""*

The funny part was that you could see him going down a script for this - It's like they expected me to answer this way. 

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""I push it forward to the next week. If I can't get it finished in the 40 hours that I'm working and it isn't absolutely needed on Monday, I'm going to leave it for the next week.""*

GeekEng is in a full on grin now - He caught the 40 hour remark, and wanted to see this out as much as I did. I was silently pleading with HRGuy to push the 45 hour work week, so I could unload. Alas, he was smarter than that, and dropped it with a, 

HRGuy - *""Well that is an option, but it does hurt your 'Percent Complete"" metric which affects your year end bonus.""*

That's fine, I don't plan on being here that long.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Attempt 1 to get me to ""fall in line"" obviously had no effect, and even emboldened me somewhat - I wasn't putting up with their shit.

Their next strategy? Publicly put everyone except me on the ""management track"" - Basically make an example out of me to the rest of the company. *You want to stand up for yourself? Well look what happened to /u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - you really want that to happen to you??*

They actually made a point of sending out company wide emails discussing the management training, and mentioning all the engineers that were doing it, while making sure I wasn't included. ""QuietGirl, GeekEng, etc, etc will be meeting this week to discuss such and such, /u/LostMyPassswordAgain2 will be working on such and such project"" type shit.

I laughed about it to myself and let it slide - really don't care, guys. This pissed them off to no end. Who wouldn't want to advance in the company, and spend more time here? You get more money!!

-----------------------------------------------------------

They were at a loss of what to do. It was about this time that a cool new project came up for bid. It was for a potato processing factory in Idaho (go figure) that basically was going to make hash browns, french fries, etc. HUGE plant. Problem is, everyone dropped the ball - Deadline was approaching, and they didn't have anyone working on the bid - They didn't even have a motor list set up yet, and the controls division was having a conniption. They had to come and ask me to work overtime to finish it by Friday. It was Tuesday. 

I took the prints home with me that night, and went to fucking town. Cranked Foo Fighters, Metallica and more while I hammered out the motor list. Ended up with over 800 motors, with all info organized into an easy to read chart. at 4:30am, I emailed the list to the entire management team.

*<All -*

*Here is the completed motor list for [Project]. I know it wasn't due until Friday but I wanted Controls to have time to get their bids done as accurate as possible. Let me know if you have any questions.>*

Controls loved me. CBA and Dumb-As-A-Post hated me now. Why? Remember, they loved to play Pass-The-Buck. When they assigned the project to me, they didn't want it to get done in time - That way it was my fault, and the blame was shifted from them. Now, I had made it public that I had worked an all nighter to save their asses. Come 9:30 am when I strolled into the office with 4 Rockstars in my arm for the day ahead, I didn't even get so much as a, ""Thanks, /u/LostMyPasswordAgain2, we really appreciate it.""

Which I knew was going to happen. However, the controls division made their disdain for my managers and company clear to me in the Reply All emails - *<Thanks SOO much, we didn't think we were going to get this in time to put the bid in! I owe ya!>* and the such. I smirked, and went back to work. I couldn't wait to get out of here.

What did catch me off guard was the email I received around noon from my manager, CBA.

*</u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 -*

*It has come to my attention that you were not on time this morning (approx. 20 minutes late). We have our core hours from 9am-4pm that you are required to be at work, so that meetings can be scheduled easier and people can contact you if need be. Please work harder on being at work on time in the future.>*

So now we're playing the ""rules are rules"" game - Even though I just saved their asses by working all night, I still wasn't ""on time"" to work so they were creating a paper trail showing me not performing ""to standards"".

-----------------------------------------------------

Later that week, I got a phone call from GeekEng's Drafter's old manager, and we talked about the open position at the company that will herein be referred to as [EnergyCo]. I was told to throw my application into the online site and he'd push it through, and get me in for the interview. 

I was getting out of here, and it couldn't come sooner.

The party finally shows up at 6:50, ten minutes before their time is up. I have a bit of freedom with the time. Unless we have another session planned for later, I can end when I want after the two hours are up. As they pulled up to the arena, I was planning on letting them play a game or two after a very abbreviated intro.

That didn't fly well with them. They wanted a full two hours. I told them that they would have to reschedule, since I had other plans. I told them again that I would let them have a game or two, even though just explaining the hardware would take most of the time left. They tried to call the boss, but had as much luck as I did.

One of my duties is basically being the receptionist. Since my ""office"" is the front desk, I have to keep it tidy. The only personal things I have are my one-a-day trivia calendar, and my quirky mug. Every else is office supplies, work I'm doing, etc. As a naturally ""ordered chaos"" sort of person and someone who likes to personalize space, this has been a trial in patience on both accounts. I have learned a lot though, and gotten better at straightening things. For example, I have paper organizers and such in my workspace. It's not messy, but it's not super clean.

Currently, I'm also working on helping bring us into the 21st century. We replaced the phone system last year, to a VoIP from a legit old-school system purchased in 1986. My boss mentioned to me like, 2 weeks ago, that the president was interested in moving the fax to the mail room and clearing the space behind my desk. I am all for it--100%. We finally got it moved today, and another member of upper management passed by. I mentioned, How nice does it look now?

He affirmed it looked nice, but then backhandedly commented that now we just need to sort everything else out, while his eyes looked directly at my sorted paperwork. Then he followed up, asking if a machine near my computer needed to stay hooked up to the computer.

Why yes, that labelmaker *does* have to be hooked up there to print. 

It wouldn't be a problem, if everyone besides me had pristine workplaces. That's the thing. **No one does.** This guy, even, uses the ""spread out paper across my desk into piles"" method to sort things. We work in construction--an industry not exactly known for its neat-ness.

It frustrates me to no end, because I'm expected to work, but not have any work around me.

~Update!~

So, without mentioning who said it, I mentioned the comment to my direct supervisor after she commented on the now empty space.
Her response was to suggest how to clean up my workspace. -_-
So, now my workspace is barren. It's so sad.

Customer complained using nothing but exaggerations and lies,30,2rz07m,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2rz07m/customer_complained_using_nothing_but/,5,1420907195.0,"I work at a kids' birthday party place where kids play and then eat pizza, cake, etc. Last weekend I had to work a 1 year old's birthday party. They're not my favorite because you can't talk to them or do anything with them. But it went alright. The kids all seemed happy and the birthday child's mom was satisfied with the service, enough that she tipped me an average amount.

Or so I thought. When I came into work earlier this week, I was told that she called the store, had a list of complaints, and demanded a refund.

First off, she said that the pizza was cold and slightly burnt, and since I allowed the kids to eat it I wasn't qualified to do my job. The pizza was definitely not cold when the kids ate it and it didn't look burnt at all. Since we're not allowed to eat any of it, how would I know that? And I lol'd when I heard that she said I wasn't qualified to do my job. The pizza place that provides our pizza does a shitty job with the pizzas we order half the time and no one ever complains.

Secondly, she claimed I was inattentive to the children while we were in the room eating our pizza and cake. In what was even a bigger lie, she said she TOLD me I was inattentive. She did no such thing. And I was paying a lot of attention to my party. What else am I supposed to do when I'm working alone? I tried to cater to the kids as much as I could. But there were only 8 or so kids, and they all ate and drank extremely slowly. I tried to do a lot but for most of the time, I sat back and watched and waited for something to do.

Lastly, at the end of the party she gave me a tip, like most customers do. It was slightly below average, but I didn't think anything of it. In her long complaint, she mentioned she wanted a refund and that she wanted to take her tip back. You'd think that she wouldn't have tipped me in the first place if she was unhappy, so that part made no sense at all. We couldn't refund the tip, obviously, but we decided to refund her what she paid for her pizzas. Even though I knew they weren't cold and burnt (how is that possible, anyway?).

My managers were cool about it. I'm considered a good employee at my job since I consistently get some of the best reviews of anybody in the store. They dismissed this lady as crazy when I told them that nearly everything she said about me was an exaggeration or a lie. 

TL;DR: Worked a birthday party for a 1 year old, her mom seemed happy at first but later told the managers how terrible I was which was based on mostly lies.",2015-01-10 18:26:35

I demand you send me your personal belongings !,40,2qzgjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2qzgjf/i_demand_you_send_me_your_personal_belongings/,1,1420088802.0,"Hey guys ! [Obligatory introduction about being a long time lurker, first time poster]


I work at a distance education center. We provide education at home for people who can't/don't want to attend classes. We send you books, you do the assignments, and, if everything goes well, you graduate !


So I just remembered this story; it happened a little over a year ago, I had been working at my office for only 6 months. It's common that we get a lot of special snowflakes, but we have some that we especially watch out for, because of how bad they get and how much of our time they waste (some to whom we are not even allowed to talk to anymore, but that's another story.)


On the very last day before I went on a 2-weeks holiday, 10 minutes before closing time, this man calls and I'd heard about him through my coworkers, but never actually spoke to him. We know it's him because he always answers with ''Yes, hi, I'm a student from your school.'' in a very monotone voice. So when I answer, I immediately know it's him; we'll call him Monotone Man (MM) :


> Me : [Distance education center], how may I help you?

> MM : Yes, hi, I'm a student from your school. I'm currently studying [random book] and it says I need Microsoft Excel to do it, but you didn't send it to me with the book.


Now, it's common for people to believe we provide Microsoft Office with the courses, as you need Word, Excel, Access and Outlook, but unfortunately, we don't, and it says so in our information booklet. However, all students must complete the books in the order they appear in our information booklet and, according to where he was at, he should have needed Word and Access earlier in his course, so I'm slightly confused as to why he would not have Excel.


> Me : I'm sorry sir, we don't actually provide Excel with the courses, you must buy it from a store such as [names a couple stores] or you can buy it online.

> MM : My tutor told me she provided it for other students, so I demand you send it to me !

> Me : Well, sir, if your tutor said she would provide it for you, then you could ask her to send it to you. Here, at [distance education center], we don't provide it for students.

> MM : No, she said you had to send it to me !


And this goes back and forth for a couple minutes with him constantly trying to get the last word like ''Okay, so you're sending it now, bye !'' and trying to hang up on me (as if that would even work?) and me almost yelling ''WAIT, WAIT !'' everytime, until he eventually spouts out this gem :


> MM : Do you even know how expensive this program is?!

> Me : Yes, sir, I know it's expensive as I bought it for myself. Unfortunately, we have no way of-

> MM : Then you can send it to me !

> Me : ... I'm sorry?

> MM : You have the program at home ! Send it to me !

> Me : Sir, I bought this program with my own money, it is not owned by [distance education center], it is my personal belonging. Now-

> MM : I'm not going to steal it ! JUST SEND IT TO ME !


At that point, I should have been gone on a 2-weeks holiday for 20 minutes and was not getting paid to deal with his crap, so I simply hung up. I should have informed him I was going to do so, something along the lines of ''Sir, I do not like the way you are speaking to me, and will now end this conversation'' (as we are allowed to do), but I was so enraged all I could do was hang up and start crying.


He called back about 12 seconds later and demanded he be transferred back to me, to which my coworker replied it was not happening, and he told her to let me know I was a ''bad sprout''. 


Needless to say, he had to make a nice trip to the electronics store to buy his program *with his own money*.

I work in Discounty's shop of convenience, odd-job employee to be more specific, ranging from retail, to being a janitor.

Due to the holidays getting close, we have more shipments than usual, therefore more boxes, something to note here, we don't have a compactor, so all the boxes go in one separate dumpster of it's own.When I clocked in, the colleague before me (whom I shall refer to as Lazy Mcmittens) told me to get rid of the boxes before the end of the weekend. When I got out to clear the first few boxes, I saw that Lazy Mcmittens left a huge batch of box outside, I simply sighed and did the whole thing while I was at it.

During this process of destroying boxes after boxes, I decided to step in the container and compact the whole thing from time to time (since we don't have a compactor, it's quite easy for the thing to overflow with cardboard)I decided to check my watch, it took me 45 minutes to do half of the thing, that's when I stepped out and tried to do it quicker, when I finished, it took around 1 hour and 15 minutes (including me jumping in the cardboard dumpster like it was some sort of trampoline), when I got back indoors, the assistant manager asked me where was I the whole time (she thought I was late), when I told her of the cardboard, she said she didn't notice me taking them outside (it was in plain sight near the back of the store, back room was already full of them, we had to put them out there for all the customers to see).

I seriously wonder what got through Lazy's head, if anything, the wild boxes (the ones outside) should've been cleared hours before I got there, as the picker came the day beforehand.

Just had to blow off some steam about it, while it did happen a while back, I already had enough to do with furniture making, floor sweeping and bathroom cleaning, trust me, interruption there is a common occurence (I'm the odd-jober after all).

Hospital Woes: You probably should have asked that first.,26,2oekuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2oekuc/hospital_woes_you_probably_should_have_asked_that/,0,1417817442.0,"So I just found this forum on account of what just happened at my semi-new office job (my first office job after working retail)

So I work at at large hospital in my state and what my job entails is admitting patients who have an appointment for various scans-pretesting, removal and placement of medical equipment, etc. If you have a reason to be at the hospital and you're not going to through the ER or inpatient services, you go through us so we can check your insurance. What we do not do, however, is set up appointments.

About an hour ago, I had a patient come in with an insurance referral to have a drainage pump removed; okay, cool this is easy. So I go to find their account and...there isn't one. Strange. Okay, so I search their name....no record of their name. So I question the patient for about ten minutes about what all is going on, the steps they've completed, and who they've spoken to. All I get from the patient is:

**Patient**: ""I had a pump placed in me here and I had to change my primary doctor, so they told me to come here to get it removed because ya'll were the ones who put it in.""

**Me**: Okay, who was the doctor?

**Patient**: Well, I had to change it from MD1 to MD2 because I had to get this referral for my insurance.

**Me**: And they set up an appointment for you to come here?

**Patient**: They told me to come here to get it removed.

**Me**: But did they actually set up an appointment for it? I can't find you or an account in our system.

**Patient**: I'm not sure

(sigh)

So I call five different departments, all of whom have no idea what I'm talking about; talk to my boss twice, who says to call the primary MD's office; call said MD's office since that MD is not in our hospital records, the office which also closed early b/c it's Friday, and just when I'm about to call the medical exchange to page the MD personally....

**Patient**: All I need ya'll to do is set up an appointment so I can get this pump removed today. Can ya'll set up an appointment or not?

(insert sounds of screeching brakes)

**Me**: ....We don't schedule appointments, only MD offices can do that and they send the forms to our scheduling dept. who sets up accounts and put you in our system.

**Patient**: So ya'll can't schedule me today?

**Me**: No, only your primary care physician can do that, so you'll have to call them, but since their office is closed, you'll have to go to the ER if you need it removed today.

**Patient**: Oh...I probably should have asked you that from the start, shouldn't I?

In my mind, I was thinking, ""Yeah, you probably should have, before I spent half an hour fretting over why you're not in the system.""",2014-12-06 00:10:42

The park was a reservoir and a nature preserve adjacent to a large undeveloped hilly area. But on the side opposite the hills, the area is surrounded by a developing urban zone. Standing on the border where the hills meet the homes is like looking at two different worlds. It's like when old people tell you about how the mall you're shopping in ""used to be all orange fields"", and all you can think to say is ""Yeah, grandpa. Take your pills"".

The surrounding city isn't world infamous or anything like that, and it's certainly no Detroit...but with bulbous urban development comes the usual set of problems. Locally, the area is known for not being a great place...and working at this park on busy days, it's not hard to see why the park district has their own internal police force.

For the six years I worked here, I had a number of run ins with less-than-pleasant individuals. Nothing serious, but a lot of citations for public drunkenness, drugs, customer-on-customer feuds that rarely escalated into physical fights...that sort of misbehavior. Working the admission gate, you saw it all and sometimes you could just tell when things were going to get rowdy.

There were a lot of working-poor in the area, and a large population of immigrants (many of whom were likely illegal)...but, let me tell you, they were often the least of your problems...in fact, I dare say that many suspected illegals were downright friendly, pleasant, church going types.

Here, the two worst customers I ever had in my whole time working there were **two crotchety old ladies in their 60s or 70s.**

As a ranger, one of my duties was inspecting boats before they got into the water. Many parks are concerned about invasive mussels: quagga mussels, zebra mussels, etc. that can do a lot of local economic damage with their infestations. They wreck boats, pipes, and pretty much everything else they attach to.

So, these ladies were cordial at first...until I start talking about inspecting their boat. Making it clear they didn't give two sh*ts about ""barnacles"", they let me know that they had been on a long trip and just ""wanted to get in the f***ing water"". After a few minutes telling them that I was required by law to inspect the boat, they refused to submit to an inspection and demanded to talk to another ranger. Ultimately, my supervisor told them the same thing, and she even assured them that we could ""waive the inspection fee"" (8 dollars) to appease them.

Unhappy and irrationally angry, the two ladies decided to simply pay for parking for general park use. I thought that would be the last I heard from them, but sadly it wasn't.

Somehow, the two older ladies roped one of the newer laborers into getting their two-person rowboat down to the water near one of the fishing docks. The newer employee didn't know regulation about boat ramp usage and **the two ""sweet old ladies"" assured them that I said their boat had passed inspection.**

So, their boat (which would have passed inspection if they had simply yielded to it) got into the water, but after trying to board from the dock and almost falling into the water the new employee wisely decided to involve more personnel.

So, a game warden pulled them out of the water and with my statement, evicted them from the premise. They were not cited (I suspect because they were old ladies) but at this point I was just happy they were gone.

Days later, I got a message from one of the higher-ups about a complaint that the ladies filed with the parks...but when me and the game warden told him about the two old bats, all he did was laugh.

Toner deliver - COPS edition,24,2nu73t,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2nu73t/toner_deliver_cops_edition/,2,1417347989.0,"My job is mostly working as a printer tech for a small MSP. However when I'm not getting ready to go Office Space on your copier I deliver ink and toner to clients. This is a tale of a delivery.

It was a warm day this past summer. I had just loaded 32 toner cartridges into my SUV to deliver to the local Sheriffs department and courthouse. As I'm driving down the road to get there I drive past one of the deputies. I merge into the lane in front of him and the red and blues light up.

At this point I'm running through what I might have done. Speed: granny pace. Swerving: not hungover so no. Signals: crap. At this point I figure that he is just pulling me over to harass me. I roll down the window and the conversation got crazy in a hurry.

Officer: ""Do you know why I pulled you over?""
Me: ""I can't think of any reason sir.""
Officer: ""When you pulled back into the right lane you didn't signal""

I knew it. Either had a quota or was bored. About this time he looks in the rear window and sees that the entire back of my blazer is filled with toner boxes.

Officer: ""Where are you headed to?""
Me just blurting the first thing that comes to mind: ""The home of your people!""
Officer: ""Excuse me!?!?""
Me: Yeah the home of your people, the Sheriff's office.""

At this point I hand him the sales order from my office and a copy of the purchase order from the county.

Officer laughing hysterically: ""Just go! Forget about it. Just go!""

I proceed to the courthouse to make my delivery. Thinking to myself that I just avoided a giant pain in the rear I realized that my license plates had been expired for a good three months. I forgot all about it and the deputy didn't even notice. Good thing he never finished getting the tags checked!

I'm not signing that!,26,2ngi1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2ngi1x/im_not_signing_that/,1,1416985677.0,"This is a tale about a former employer. We shall call him Douchebag Dave (DD for good measures). DD owns a vehicle dealership with a male sheep's head as it's logo. While I have many MANY tales about DD's dealership, this tale comes long after I had broken free of his grasp. 

I worked for DD for about 18 months, sold 100 vehicles within 6 months and got promoted to Social media manager for the remainder of my time there (12 months of being paid to take pictures and chat. It's NOT all it's cracked up to be, believe me!). 

I left on my own good terms and occasionally visited my ex coworkers from time to time. Then I started a new part time business, where I could save business owners significant savings. I approached DD's in house controller with this prospect and was given a statement to check (normal day's work, check what is being paid out, suggest improvements, carry on with sale). After initially processing the statement, it was discovered that DD would save $175 a month. A fairly decent sum of any business owner's profits. As required, after presenting my quote, I asked for their business. I was told that DD needs to look at the figures and decide but the controller was going on vacation first so I could return in a few weeks. Few weeks later, I return. Now DD is busy, so I was rescheduled again (it happens, owners get busy, make another appointment. Rinse repeat). Finally after a number of emails (3 months later) I get the all clear to come in to get the paperwork completed. This is where things hit the wall. 

I handed the paperwork to controller, who proceeded to complete the required info. While she was completing things, she asked questions and carried on. The entire process took about 30 minutes. She took the papers to DD to sign and they got faxed away to my boss. Controller had made a mistake by stamping the documents so the documents had to be resubmitted (argh). This time, DD wasn't happy. Something he had initially agreed to, he no longer thought he should. 

""I bought a $500,000 photocopier without signing a guarantor. Why do I need this?!""

I felt like asking if I could buy a car without signing but I held composure and left. After speaking with my boss, he got on the phone to an even higher boss and called me back. 

""We have approval for DD without him signing. We will call him for you!""

GREAT news right?! Yeah not so much...

DD basically told my boss to ""go f**k yourself"" after wasting all our time involved. Even though I didn't get the sale, I smile while driving past now, knowing that I COULD help him, but every competitor that I sign around him, will gain instead. 

""Go f**k yourself too DD"" :)",2014-11-26 09:07:57

The Amazing Vanishing Trainee,22,2m3bjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2m3bjl/the_amazing_vanishing_trainee/,1,1415814765.0,"Context: I'm a trainer at a call center. This particular post will tell you about the an employee that got on my nerves this week.

When I started this week's new hire class on Monday I had four trainees - D, J, S, and M. They all seemed reasonable people and M in particular seemed quite sharp. He also happened to be the boyfriend of a current employee and came highly recommended. Normally we give them the new hire paperwork during the interview to fill out and bring back with them when they begin training. With this particular class, however, our hiring manager had gotten a little behind and none of them had been given paperwork. No big deal. I give them the packets and ask to have them back the next day.

Tuesday comes around and M is a no show. At first I figured he was just late because we got hit with a snowstorm and driving is tricky. After 15 minutes I call him, got no answer, leave a voicemail, and start class. Two hours later when we take out first break he still hasn't showed or called. His girlfriend happens to be off today too so I can't ask her what the deal is. I call and leave another voicemail and long story short he never shows up. That sucks, I guess he didn't need the job that badly.

Now it's Wednesday and all morning long our center manager has been getting on my ass about M going AWOL. We have to pay him for the day that he was here but don't have any of the paperwork. Apparently it's my fault for letting him take the paperwork home, never mind the fact that we have always let them take the paperwork home and the other three trainees didn't have a problem showing up.

How was I supposed to know he'd never come back?",2014-11-12 19:52:45

"There are bad smells, and then there are stenches.",32,2kwx16,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2kwx16/there_are_bad_smells_and_then_there_are_stenches/,2,1414784001.0,"Hello all! Usually read TFTS, but this doesn't exactly fit in there, so... tada!

Way back when I was in high school, I worked over the summer for the family business, a local ice cream company. Not only did we produce ice cream, we rented freezers for clients to sell it out of.

One of our customers was a factory, and sold ice cream out of a refrigerated vending machine in their break area. To stock the vending machine, they had a chest freezer with a solid lid. (As opposed to the freezers you see in convenience stores with the glass lids you can see the product through. The chest style are more efficient, as they are insulated on all sides and have a rubber gasket around the lid that controls airflow.) 

Eventually, that factory decided to go with another supplier, but didn't actually tell us this. They just unplugged our freezer. Still full of ice cream. FULL of ice cream. In July.

At least two **weeks** later (I don't remember the exact timespan), they decided maybe they should give us a call to come pick up our unit. The head of service and I know what's coming, but we drive up to the client, load the freezer into our truck, and head back to our shop.

We get back, and finally open the thing up. All of the ice cream had of course melted and gone sour. There were 5 inches of rotten milk/chocolate/nuts/fruit bits/packaging floating the in bottom of the unit. The sides of the unit were completely (And I mean *completely*) covered by hatched maggot shells.

It was, hands down, the worst thing I have ever smelled. I couldn't get within 10 feet of the thing without nearly retching.

Of course, being the high school kid, I got to be the one to clean it out. (The service guy certainly didn't want to do it.) I wore a painter's respirator so I could get close, kicked it over so the mess would flow into the parking lot drain, and used a kerosene-heated power washer to clean it out.

It still took a good 3 hours just to make it visibly clean, and longer to get the smell out.

I hope to never smell anything that bad again.

(And now a small twofer; same thing happened to my grandfather decades before. The store was up in the mountains, and went out of business. For this one, it was a month before we found out. So my grandfather goes up there with a coworker, pulls the freezer unit out of the shut-down service station into the parking lot, and kicks the unit over on its side. He then looks at his coworker and says ""Alright, let's go."" Two weeks later, he came back and picked up the cabinet, after the racoons etc had had time to clean the worst of the mess up for him.)",2014-10-31 21:33:21

"Hi, Mrs. Hernandez, do you have cancer?",31,2k3ipg,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2k3ipg/hi_mrs_hernandez_do_you_have_cancer/,1,1414074411.0,"As an administrative assistant, I don't take very many days off because too much crap goes down whenever I'm gone, so naturally, when I took a sick day yesterday, the spaghetti hit the fan and I returned to an excellent story I'd like to share with you all.

First, some background. I work for a field office for a small sub-contracting corporation in Indiana, far from the prying eyes of corporate on the other side of the country. We have a love-hate relationship (more hate than anything) with the corporate HR lady, Midge*. She usually makes life more complicated than is absolutely necessary, but sometimes, when the moon is full and we're in on the joke, she's not so bad. This is one of those times.

Upon returning to work today, my boss, Bill, informs me that I missed some serious stuff yesterday and begins to fill me in. As a sub-contracting company, many of our clients require our personnel to complete safety training on-site before beginning a job. Sometimes, they also require a drug test. Whenever this happens, we usually try to give them a heads up just so they aren't caught completely unaware (which would make us look bad as a company). Usually, this doesn't pose any problems since most of our guys are on the road so much, they would be hard-pressed to smoke weed every night as it is.

We have one employee, Jose, that lives out of state. He returns to the office after a job and informs Bill that he has to return home because his wife is in the hospital and she may have cancer, BUT he'll be back in two days. Bill senses something is up because it's really odd that he would fly back for just two days and the timing is really odd. I mean, this guy just found out he has to take a drug test, and now this bizarre thing with his wife? Yeah, no.

So, Bill fills his boss, Timmy, and Midge in on what's going on since we will now have to fly an employee from another location to our office to go on this job. They all agree that Jose's story is fishy and Midge gives Bill the go-ahead to request documentation from Jose showing when his wife was admitted to and discharged from the hospital and a date for when he will be moving to Indiana like he promised back when he first got hired on a year ago. When Jose doesn't respond for the next 24 hours, Midge schedules an appointment for him to get drug tested in Florida, but when Bill tells him he needs to be at THIS address at THIS time for a drug test, Jose says, ""I'm with family at the hospital and family comes first, bro. I'll go tomorrow.""

At this point, Bill, who hates nothing more than being lied to, is getting irate, and Midge takes matters into her own hands. She calls Jose's house ""looking for Jose"" and his wife, Mrs. Hernandez, picks up. Midge plays innocent and says she's looking for Jose. His wife is confused and informs Midge that Jose is in Indiana working. Then, Midge asks her if everything is okay and whether she's been in the hospital recently. Mrs. Hernandez tells Midge that she was in the hospital for an outpatient surgery a week and a half ago, but nothing serious.

Someone really ought to let Jose know that it's bad karma to lie about a loved one having cancer...

Maybe you shouldn't bring your infant into the cave?,69,2fborc,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2fborc/maybe_you_shouldnt_bring_your_infant_into_the_cave/,10,1409714842.0,"Sorry for the long post! I just discovered this place and am pretty eager to start sharing stories! :D

When I was a teenager, I got my first (and favorite) job as a cave tour guide. The area I lived in was well renown for its karst, and although most caves that were available for walking tours were owned by the government, the tour facility was owned privately.

The facility I worked at offered two different tours for two different caves: a 30 minute tour of a wet cave with lots of cool formations and an easy walking path, great for children and the elderly; and a 90 minute tour of a dry cave with a pretty rugged path, steep stairs, and sometimes very tight passageways. We usually recommended that families with small children use discretion when it came to tours of the big cave, since there were no bathrooms down there and it could get kinda scary.

Nevertheless, one day we got a family of three -- a mother, her 4 year old daughter, and her young infant -- who wanted to take a tour of the big cave. The daughter did not look thrilled about the concept of a cave, and I suggested the smaller cave might be better for ""beginners"", but the mother was pretty insistant that it was big cave or moot. She purchased tickets and they joined another couple outside who were waiting for the same tour. 

The cave tour began. 5 people in total. 10 minutes into the tour, the 4 year old freaked out. The poor thing was crying alligator tears and begged her mother to go back outside. To be honest, it's a pretty easy cave to freak out in, especially with so few people in such a big, dark place. I offered to take the family back to the entrance of the cave and give them a refund for their ticket prices, but the mother decided to stick with the tour. 

60 minutes into the tour, we got into our big cave's main attraction -- a giant room the size of a football field with a mountain of breakdown and a few formations in the middle. At this point in the tour, guides usually demonstrated how dark the cave truly is by turning off all the lights, telling a ghost story, then leaving the guests on a set of bleachers while we go climb up the mountain and do a fun shadow dance using a candle. I decided to skip the ghost story and shadow dance because of the still scared-and-silently-crying little girl... but I HAD to turn out the lights. The way the lighting system was set up, I could only turn off the lights from the base of the mountain (we were required to turn off the lights as we went, company policy to save on electricity and common courtesy for other tour guides), but could only turn ON the next string of lights from the top of the mountain. 

I told the group my plan to leave them in the dark, the lights went off and I began to make my way up the path to the mountain with my flashlight. The whole process took about five minutes, since I would have to break away from the walking path and actually climb up the breakdown to the lightswitch. I was about halfway up when the mother hollered up at me.

* Her: It's too dark in here! My infant is scared! Turn the lights on NOW!
* Me: I'm sorry, I'm almost there!
* Her: My infant is terrified!!! Turn the lights ON or show us your FLASHLIGHT!!! 

Note that her infant hadn't made a peep the whole trip, and I couldn't divert my flashlight from where I was shining it... or else I wouldn't have been able to see where I was going. 

* Me: Don't worry, ma'am, I'm almost to the switch!
* Her: TURN THE F***ING LIGHTS ON, NOW!!!

At this point, two things happened. First, I dropped my flashlight and it rolled down the mountain and got stuck in between a few rocks. Great. Then the infant, probably scared by its mother's yelling, began crying louder than anything I'd ever heard. Even better. I had to feel my way back down to retrieve my flashlight, and it took me even longer to get up to the lightswitch. The infant could not be consoled. I then realized that we weren't going to make it out of the cave in 90 minutes, which meant I'd be getting no breaks in between tours. 

Eventually I got all the lights back on and got the group into the next section of the cave. The mother kept giving me the most evil stare and the other couple on the trip was rather unamused. 80 minutes into the tour, and the mother stopped the group so she could change her infant's diaper. She was upset that she had to change it on the dirty cave floor. Then she wanted to leave the dirty diaper in the cave, and told me I could just ""get it later"". I told her that tour groups were not allowed to leave any trash inside the cave and that she would have to carry it out with her. She refused.

* Her: YOU carry it out! It's your fault there are no trash cans in here! And besides, I'm carrying my baby. How can I carry my baby AND the diaper?!

I ended up finishing the rest of the tour while carrying that dirty diaper out of the cave with me. The infant never stopped crying, and at the end of the tour she complained to my manager that I scared her children. We ended up refunding the tickets of the other couple since I was sure their experience was not enjoyable, but luckily they were very understanding and equally perplexed as to why that mother took her kids on that tour in the first place.

tl;dr - Mother stupidly took young kid and infant on a long, rugged cave tour. They got scared and poopy.

Organically Yours,22,2f4zy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2f4zy5/organically_yours/,1,1409541913.0,"Prior to working retail, I worked 5 years on and off at an organic veggie packing facility. It's some of the most mundane, repetitive work I've had the pleasure of doing. I have many stories from that place, but could never find the place to post them. Former job wasn't quite a kitchen, rare contact with customers so it filled a bit of some roles, but nothing where I could see any of my stories fitting. So lets give this place a go. 

I found working there to be grossly unfair. They'd treat certain employees extremely well to keep them around, giving them lighter work loads and more days off while putting more pressure on the other employees to work faster, work more days and longer hours just to keep up with the product demand. If you took complaints to the office about a coworkers bad behavior or work ethic you were accused of bullying them, even if said person said racist things about coworkers while they were working beside them. You had to work overtime with no overtime pay because of farm status for the garden in the back that they sometimes used for profit strictly in the summer months so it wasn't uncommon to work from 7 in the morning to 5 at night. The management sat in the office most of the time and were barely hands on with the new recruits, or anybody for that matter. They put on smiling faces when they had too, but behind closed doors, there was a lot of bickering between the 6 or 7 management team members as they struggled for their say. They often talked about employees to other employees or left the office door open during breaks so employees sitting in the break room could clearly hear everything being said. There was no room to grow, promotions were given randomly to the inexperienced, raises were scarce and you'd be lucky to see much higher than minimum wage ($10.25) after 3 years of service. In fact, if you're hired strictly to pack, you cap out at $10.75. They'd often give certain employees raises to keep them quiet or to keep them around longer, claims from one woman were she was making $12.00 but spent much of her time bitching about everything and did bare minimum work. Mind you this is in CanadaLand, so there's that to consider when talking about minimum wage. When I first started working there back in late 2005 during my first three year run (I left for a year and half about and then went back), about 5 or 6 of the employees were sleeping with each other, there was a chlamydia scare shortly after, they had various points had hired people who actively drank booze on the job, showed up to work high on a cocktail of drugs ranging from pot to coke, ecstasy to mushrooms and any mixture of any of them (once had a coworker show up high on horse tranq's but said it was okay because she mixed it with coke), Rarely did they fire anybody because they were hurting for the workers. During the year and a half I was gone, they cleaned up their act after their food safety was questioned and wound up laying a bunch of people off before hiring me again. I spent the next three years coasting at this job until I couldn't take anymore. So r/talesfromthejob, where should I begin?",2014-09-01 06:25:13

We started in a small office with just a few of us and soon grew to 250 people, taking over the building space on all sides of us.  In that first location, I was centrally located -- all the senior people tended to be in the middle since that's how the company grew.  When window offices opened up, I didn't want one since it would move me away from the center of the action.

About 10 years ago, our company moved to another building.  As is typical, the windows seats were assigned to those with seniority, so I had a window assigned.  I sat there for a day and hated it because of where the sun was in relation (glare, heat, brightness), so I moved away from the window.

About 3 years ago, we were moving again.  Of course, seniority would get the windows again, and I knew that my department was on a non-sun side, so I thought I'd want it.

Enter the antagonist, Mari.  Mari had also been with the company a long time, so had about a year or two less seniority than me.  She currently had a window office, and key to the story, she currently had a window office and has had a window office for much of her time at the company.

Also key to the story is that I knew she was getting a window office in the new building because I saw the ""secret"" (not secret, but not disseminated yet) list.

Mari comes to me in an indignant mood.

>Mari:  We need to trade offices in the new building.  So, I'll go tell Rob, OK?

>Me:  Why do you want to trade offices?

>Mari:  Oh, you're just sitting where I want to be.  You'll like it better if we switch.

>Me:  (Starting to suspect what was going on.)  Oh?  What's better about your future office?

>Mari:  Oh, it will just be closer to the conference rooms and kitchen.  You'll like it better.  I'll go tell Rob, OK?

>Me:  (Playing dumb.)  Well, if you think I'll like it better...  But what I really want is a window office.

>Mari:  Oh, no you don't.  You'll like this other office better.

>Me:  Do you know if I'll be getting a window office in the new building?  I don't have one now and that makes me sad.

>Mari:  Oh, no, you don't want a window office.  They get hot sometimes.  You'll like this new office better.

>Me:  So, are you saying that I've been assigned a window office in the new building?

>Mari:  Well, yes, but you won't like it.  I'm sure you won't like it.

>Me:  Oh, I've always wanted a window office.  That makes me so happy that I'll _finally_ be getting one.

>Mari:  No, you don't want it.  I have a window office now and I'm sure you don't want it.

>Me:  So, you want to do me a favor by switching offices with me?

>Mari:  Well, yeah, I guess so.

>Me:  (She still hasn't recognized that I'm messing with her.)  That is so nice of you!  Will I owe you anything in return for the favor you're doing for me?

>Mari:  Well, no.  We'll just switch offices.  I'll go tell Rob, OK?

>Me:  No.  I've changed my mind.  I want to try out one of these sucky window offices.  I've _never_ had a window office.  I'd like to try it out.

>Mari:  (Suddenly getting miffed now that the prize was so close but now seemingly lost.)  Look.  I have a window office now.  I've had one for 10 years.  I'm _used to_ having a window office.  I cannot go back to not having a window office.  But you, you've never had a window office, so you're not used to it.

>Me:  So, I should give you the future window office because you have one now.

>Mari:  Yes.  I deserve the window office because I have one now.  I like looking out the window at the trees and the birds.

>Me:  Oooo!  I want to look at the trees and the birds.

>Mari:  Well, that's the thing.  You won't miss it the way that I will.  I deserve your office.  I'll go tell Rob, OK?

>Me:  So, since I've never had the luxury, I won't miss it, but you, who have had it for 10 years, deserve to have it forever.

>Mari:  Yes.  I'll go tell Rob.

>Me:  I'm messing with you.  I'm not trading offices with you.

>Mari:  (Suddenly very angry.)  You're being difficult!

Mari then leaves.  I assume that she's going to talk to Rob and will find out that both of us are getting window offices and so there's no reason for her to want to switch.

Mari comes to me the next day.

>Mari:  So, I was thinking about our argument all last night.

>Me:  Yeah, I was surprised you got all upset about it.

>Mari:  Yeah, so I think you should apologize.  And then I'll go talk to Rob, OK?

>Me:  What?  You still think that you deserve my new office instead of me?  You're being silly.

>Mari:  (Suddenly furious.)  You're the one who is being unreasonable!  (Storms off.)

Again, I assume that she'll go talk to Rob and realize that she already has what she's coveting.

A few days later, I see her in the hallway and I decide to mess with her again.

>Me:  So, I talked to Rob.  It turns out that you were getting the corner window office, and I was just getting a regular window office.  I like the idea of having the corner office.  So, I'm taking you up on your suggestion, and I told Rob that we're switching offices.  So, I'll get the corner and you'll get the normal window.  So, now you should be happy since you're getting your way.

>Mari:  But!

I then walk off.  Again, assuming that she'll talk to Rob about this, but I don't know that she has never had a discussion with Rob on this topic.

We move into the new building.  We both have normal window offices, and we're neighbors.

>Mari:  I'm still really pissed at you.

She basically then didn't talk to me for the next few years until she left the company.  I tried bringing it up once again, but she still insisted that I was being unreasonable and had a bad attitude.

What happened to that? All the stories vanished, and all I can imagine is that MD has killed the author, and hidden her body in a lake, and is deleting the stories to hide the evidence.

Although nominally an engineer, I also handled IT tech support, sales, system design, unloading the fucking truck on deliveries and providing space heating in winter. Worst of all, I handled the phones, and customer support.

Now, how he business usually worked was that we'd quote for a system, the customer would pay for it, then we'd hire an installer we liked and who lived nearby to go and actually do the job - which involved roof work and heights.

All this comes around one morning when I'm in hole-scratching mode on my own in the office because business is on the downward spiral, and the phone rings.

Never, ever have I longed for the ability to just reach down the phone and fucking strangle someone. She didn't give two wet shites about whether the man who fell off her roof was OK, just that she made certain she was getting money off. She didn't even call the ambulance first.... No, it was the discount that came first. 

Reminding her that, if he fell of her roof, it was her responsibility as a homeowner and we could sue her for it, made her forget all about it. What I wanted to tell her was exactly where she could stuff her poxy discount - and a word that was spelled very like count indeed.

If only I had the stones.

So, we've established that I'm working for a group of assholes. 

You have no idea.

Fast forward a few months from Part 2.

My manager (CBA for refresher) was a world champion Pass-The-Buck player. He was extremely disorganized, and delays that were caused by this were often blamed on either myself or the other subordinate engineer under him. When I say OR, I really mean mostly me. The other engineer in our group, who had been there a few years, grew tired of this and really was managing his own projects at this point, and bypassing CBA altogether. He wasn't being paid more for managing his own projects, he just wasn't getting his ass chewed because CBA fucked him over in meetings when asked why certain milestones weren't being reached. CBA liked this, because it lightened his workload and made him look better.

Fuck that. I'm not doing someone else's job, just because I don't want to get yelled at. I'll just yell back instead.

------------------------------------------------

Now, a prelude to explain a few things. Have you ever seen those self help books aimed at managers, who want to fix things at work? If you ever interview and your prospective manager starts bragging about how they're reading these books and starting to implement them, walk away. Is your current job asking you to start reading these in a workplace-type bookclub? Update your resume. The president of [Company] who I'm going to call Dumb-As_A-Post from now on, had a hard-on for these things. At one of our monthly meetings, he rolled out the new idea we had to do - The [BHAG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal). It was painful to say the least. Another idea that he got from watching a Youtube video was to implement [20 Time](http://www.9inchmarketing.com/2012/12/10/before-20-time-there-was-15-time-3m/). Basic premise:

>If your idea is beneficial to the company, you can spend up to 20% of your time on it, if you so please. It can be any project you would like to work on, just have the passion to follow it through.

The problem is, he didn't use it in that manner. See, Dumb-As-A-Post saw it like this: If everyone works on an idea that will be beneficial to the company, they'll save all kinds of money!! So, instead of allowing people to work on projects they come up with that sparks an interest, he had us ""submit"" projects to the admin (himself and the project managers) where they would then be approved or sent back down and tweaked - i.e., we want you to do something else. For a non-creative person like myself, we still had to do this - there was no option to opt out, and just work. Nope, we had to. Not only was participation mandatory, but we weren't allowed to work on this whenever - Once every other month, 2 days were set aside where everyone had to work on their projects. No matter what. Didn't matter what jobs were coming up on deadlines, etc. You're working on your cute little science projects.

So, with looming deadlines, we were told to turn Outlook to out of office and even set up an auto reply telling vendors, customers, and our electricians they would be contacted the following Monday (it was Thursday). Needless to say, this didn't go over well either. Nonetheless, Dumb-As-A-Post pushed these every 2 months. I was starting to see why everyone in every other division of [Company] hated him.

------------------------------------------------------

Before I had even started this job, there were metrics for *everything*, probably based on some other book telling him to monitor this and monitor that. I wish I had kept some of the metrics sheets (they were even posted in the bathroom stalls, that way you could read through them in your ""free time"" in there), as they were just ungodly ridiculous. I understand wanting to have numbers to compare to, but there comes a point when it's overboard. One of these metrics that was monitored was the ATC (Assigned Tasks Completed) percentage. Being that we were a [Design-Bid-Build](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design-bid-build) company, we weren't billing our time to the client, that was all coming out of our bid price. So in all fairness, time management is a good thing for a company like this to look at. They just went at it all fucked up.

See, at the beginning of every week, we were assigned enough tasks to fill up our 45 hours, more than usually though we receive about 48-50 hours of tasks. Either way, at the end of the week a calculation would take place based on the tasks you marked complete out of the amount assigned to you. So, if you had unfinished tasks on Friday afternoon, you had a couple choices. You could let them slide to next week, and take a hit on the metric, or get them done on your own time, and not take the hit. Since this metric was used to calculate your year-end bonus, you can guess what a large amount of the engineers did. See, we not only did this work to keep our own stats up, but one of the drafters may be depending on you to get something done next week so they can do their assigned tasks associated with that same design path. If you didn't have something done, the drafter would go to CBA and say, ""Hey I don't have the material to get this task done."" and CBA would come back with, ""Well, leave it on your task list and you should have it by Wednesday.

Of course, construction being the beast that it is, things often get shuffled around. This system fucked everyone. And here's the kicker. If you didn't finish all your tasks in a week like above, you still had to finish them or take a hit on your metrics. But, say you get lucky and finish 48 hours of works in 40 hours or so, and it's Friday at noon. You gonna head home for the weekend, get out for a bit? Don't think so. If you finished early, you were then expected to pull more work forward from the next week. So your hard work was rewarded with - more work.

This all came to a head one afternoon in Dumb-As-A-Post's office, as I had another bi-weekly meeting with him, I'm sure another idea taken from a corporate book on how to connect to your employees. Side note - he actually had 15 minutes a week scheduled into his calendar to walk around and ""converse"" with workers. If you're scheduling social interaction, you're doing it wrong. So, on to the meeting.

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""So, do you have anything else today?*""

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Yeah, I do actually. I'd like to talk about how work is assigned, along with the [design class homework](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2c7d11/fuck_this_shit_part_ii_the_desolation_of_my_will/).""*

At this point, he finally closed his laptop, and started listening. During these meetings, he would usually talk with you while answering emails, or doing whatever else on his PC instead of actually listening to you. This was going to be interesting. I continued.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""It concerns me that my performance metrics are based partially on things that are out of my control. Say, if someone else runs into problems with their assigned tasks that are prereqs to mine. Now my metrics are lower because someone else ran into problems that may or may not have been their fault either.""*

*<Dumb-As-A-Post's eye starts to twitch a bit.>*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""So at this point, it forces people to take personal time that should be spent outside of work on work related tasks, just to keep a metric high enough to get a bonus.""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""Well, my first impression at that point is that you're just not managing your time effectively enough.*""

Oh, fuck you. I can see him shift his weight back in his chair, probably about to lean back and grab one of his self help books off his bookshelf for me. I jump back into it to keep him from doing just that.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Actually, I would say I manage my time very effectively, and that's where the conflict here is. I want to keep work and work, and actually have a home life away from here. If I've work 45-50 hours in a week, I don't see how it can be requested that I work even more just to get a task done because it wasn't ready for me at the beginning of the week.""*

Now he's pissed. Fuck it, nothing to lose at this point.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""This actually goes right to the other topic I wanted to talk about: Design Class. Why are we required to be doing any work that pertains to this outside of work hours at all?""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""All engineers spend time outside of work hours improving themselves, Lost. I don't see why you think you would be any different...""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""You're correct, engineers with PE licenses do spend about 16 hours a year on continuing education. They're also making six figure salaries. What I'm referring to is that this company wants brand new engineers to spend 6-8 hours of their off time each week working on assignments without pay for this company.""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""Well I don't see a problem here, you're gaining knowledge and experience that you can take with you wherever your career takes you with this class.""*

Now my eye is starting to twitch. Note that our volume has been escalating this entire time, as both of us are getting frustrated.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Yes, but it's also helping this company, as we discuss the exact design standards wanted here. I'd say that makes it a situation where the company benefits as well, moreso than the engineer actually. Not to mention that it's a mandatory class. If it was optional, I could see your point. I just don't see why I should have to do more work for [Company] after I leave work and drive 35 minutes home.""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""Nobody forced you to live that far away.""*

I'm losing focus.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""No, but if you're asking me to do company work once I get home, that still is an issue. I have no problem driving that far to work. What I have a problem with is getting home after driving that far and being required to do more work that benefits [Company].""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""Yes, but it still benefits you as an engineer.""*

This is going nowhere.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""I never denied that, I'm just stating that it should be paid work, as it benefits this company more.""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""Well, I don't see why you're upset about this, every other engineer has gone through this without complaining. Even I went through this class when I started.""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Well, I guess I actually enjoy being around my family more than I enjoy working.""*

<INSTANT RAGE>

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""WELL IF YOU'RE SAYING YOU'D RATHER NOT WORK HERE AS AN ENGINEER -""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH. I never said anything of the sort. I simply stated I think it's grossly unfair to be expected to perform company tasks on personal time.""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""WELL IT ISN'T A COMPANY TASK, IT'S A PERSONAL TASK.""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""I guess we're going to have to disagree on that one.""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""Is that all you had this week?""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""Yep.""*

Dumb-As-A-Post - *""OK. Good talk.""*

He opens his laptop and goes back to work.

I get up and walk out of his office, and see GeekEng [giving me a look similar to this](http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Shia_LaBeouf_surprised.jpg). I shrug my shoulders, shake my head and go back to my desk. I think it's time to start updating my resume.

I head home for the night around 6 or so, have another argument with my girlfriend, and go to bed. When I get into the office the next morning, there's something in my inbox.

[Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/2xc15y/fuck_this_shit_part_v_the_engineer_strikes_back/)

So, to recap:

I got the job I thought I wanted, turns out it isn't as perfect as I thought. What job is though, *amiright*? At least they didn't try and hide stuff from me going through the interview process th.... Wait. Crap. Well,we'll make the best of it, and get some decent experience nonetheless. 

So my first day, right after the awkward staring contest between myself and HRGuy over minimum hours required, I get introduced to my first co-worker. HRGuy brings me in, we do the, ""Hey, how ya doin',"" etc, etc. I'm going to be sharing this cubicle with one of the other engineers that we'll call Mary, who commutes to my office but works from Office #2 a couple days a week, so save on gas and such.

- *Side note - I would commute to this job once working full time (35 mins. each way - driving east in the morning, and west at night - yay for the little things that annoy you), as the state the corporate office is in has an income tax, and since I personally don't agree with that, I wanted to pay as little as possible. Plus, I wanted to live in my home state where I like the gun laws better, like the CCW permitting process and such.*

So I sit down, and open my laptop, and get to organizing my desktop the way I want it, etc. I open my Outlook, and see I already have a few emails. Makes sense, IT has probably had the laptop set up for a couple days with my info. So, I start reading through them. The first message I read:

*All - please consider this my official resignation from the position of Electrical Engineer at [Company]. I have decided to pursue other opportunities in this field, etc, etc.*

""Huh,"" I say. ""Not the first thing you want to see when you start a new job, not exactly a good sign, eh?"" I say over my shoulder in a cynical manner. Remember, construction worker cum engineer. We aren't subtle. 

*<Silence>* 

Mary looks at me out of the side of her eye, smirks slightly, then turns back to her laptop. Hmmm.

So, on and on, I work part time until I'm out of school, get to the corporate office, start full time, and get to find out about other fun items. During the real orientation, I then learned about the other ""work"" (in parenthesis because I consider it work, they didn't) that I would be expected to perform.

Industrial electrical design is covered by the NEC (National Electric Code) same as any other electrical work in the country. It's a MASSIVE code book, and has a large amount of nuances, exceptions that are noted in the book, etc. as there should be; electrical work is complex and there are a multitude of different situations one can encounter. I went to school for and was an electrician before I went for my EE degree, so I was familiar with the NEC, but knew that it was a massive book and I could use the knowledge as much as the other new engineers. So, once a week we would meet during our lunch hour (in all fairness, this counted for 1 hour of the 45 during the week, so it did have that going for it), and discuss certain Articles in the NEC. This is cool. What engineer doesn't like to talk about the nuances of their work with other like engineers? That wasn't the shitty part. The shitty part was what came next during out first ""class"". 

I started the class with 2 other engineers, one that I graduated with. She was a nice, quite girl (herein known as Quiet Girl) - extremely naive, and to be honest I didn't see her making it very long in the real world. She had never had any job growing up, other than teaching figure skating. Mommy and Daddy bought her a condo near campus so she didn't have to live in a run down apartment like all those other lowly students, etc. But, being a figure skater, she did have a cute ass, so she did have that going for her. And, she did have some of the high grades in the class. However, she would later learn that an electrician on site doesn't care what your GPA was, they just want to know if what they're going to do is legal and if it will work. That's it. She didn't like that.

The other new engineer was the epitome of geek, and I loved him. Beard, didn't give a shit what he looked like as long as he followed dress code, fun to discuss games with, fun as hell to talk to in general actually. We're going to call him Geek Eng.

>This company is in the middle of [Dutch Reformed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church) country, so making religious jokes is probably a bad idea. Everyone stares at him in shocked silence. Quiet Girl's jaw is resting on her chest almost. He's clearly confused as to why, as he wasn't being derogatory, just being silly.

>Everyone laughed extremely uncomfortably and GeekEng and I embarked on a year long relationship of ""Fuck this place, we should quit. Wait. We need money, let's not quit. Yet.""

-------------------------------------------------------

My project manager, who from here on out will be referred to as CBA (Competent But Asshole), lead the class, as he had a number of years doing design work, and apparently drew the short straw. Moving on. 

CBA - *""Alright, since this is the first class for a few of you, I'm going to go over the requirements.""*

...Requirements?

CBA - *""Each week, we'll be covering a different section of the NEC and discussing the design implications that it has for us.""*

Yeah, we've already talked about that. Let's get to it.

CBA - *""Before each week's topic, you will be required to read some ARTICLES...""*

This is in caps, because as he said this, he started handing out the three 4"" binders to each of us that contained the articles for us to read. Clearly not quick or light reading. 

CBA - *""ARTICLES... about the topic that we will be discussing. In addition, these binders also have questions that need to be answered about each subject before we discuss it in class.""*

Fair enough, we need to at least have a rudimentary understanding of the topic before discussing it. I raise my hand.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""So, is there a certain day that will be scheduled for us to do this, or do we just schedule it in for whenever during the week?""*

CBA looks confused. Not a good sign.

CBA - *""You should be doing this at night, when you're at home?""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2 - *""So, you're saying this doesn't count towards the 45 hours a week of work, we're just supposed to do it in our free time?""*

CBA - [*""Yes.""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRp_mVi969I)

*<Uncomfortable silence>*

CBA - *""...OK, so let's get started...""*

GeekEng looks at me, and I confirm the look back to him.

I plan on making this a multiple part series if there's interest at all, as a somewhat tribute to my late grandfather, a wonderful mentor and friend.

A little backstory before I start. I'm an electrical engineer, and I work in industrial design. I like to think I'm what an engineer is supposed to be - a construction worker who came up through the ranks, and then got the extra education to work as the engineer on the jobsite.

I may be a bit young (30) for people to think I have extensive construction experience, but I started working when I was 5.

Yes, 5. 

My grandfather was remodeling a college that he bought, and was turning the dorms into apartments. Since my dad wasn't around, grandpa was a good babysitter during the summer. Hence, my construction education. That first summer, I cut every single piece of pipe (copper and PVC) and wire that went into these buildings, in addition to pouring/finishing concrete, cutting lumber, etc. Through the years, I worked with my grandpa on many projects. I worked in his sawmill during middle school, and built industrial warehouses with him in high school. Suffice to say, I've had a bit of experience, and have grown up in the construction industry. 

While that gives me much more experience and insight compared to most kids who get engineering degrees it seems, it can also put me at an extreme disadvantage - I didn't have to play office politics at all growing up. I had a few other jobs while in high school, but I didn't like any of them - and to be honest, they didn't like me. Working with construction laborers, you become used to the brash, in-your-face style of communication at the workplace.

Have a problem with someone's work? Tell them. Simple as that. If your foreman has a problem with you? You'll know, trust me. While that may sound stressful, I don't see it that way, and I don't think most all construction workers do either. I'd rather have this then sitting in a cubicle, thinking you're doing a good job, then getting blindsided with a shitty performance review 3 months later. Construction workers may be brash, but they'll never be passive aggressive, that's for sure.

-------------------------------------------------

So, I have my difficulties transitioning to the workplace after getting my degree, and this series of stories will illustrate such.

My last semester of college, I started looking for employment. There's no shortage of need for engineers around the midwest, so I didn't need to start looking any sooner. However, I want to stay close to my hometown. It's got a population of about 250,000, so it isn't huge, but not small either. This narrowed my search a slight bit as The industrial construction industry isn't the biggest employer for EEs to begin with, but I still have quite a few options. 

The first company I interview with seems to really fit what I'm looking for when I speak to the HR lady (herein referred to as.... HRLady). This was where my construction worker mentality put me at a disadvantage - I was naive enough to actually believe people meant what they said, and weren't just telling white lies. She started in on the, ""[Company] is a family oriented company, who believes time with family is *just* as important as the job we do at work. After all, a happy worker is a good worker!"" and on. Cue me with the doe-eyed look across the table, eating this shit up. I get a decent salary, and normal hours? I'd never known what it was like to get off work before 7:00pm unless it was storming outside and the roof wasn't on the building yet. And this company actually values an employee's time at home with the family? Fucking score!!!

This is exactly what I wanted with an engineer's job. I get to work on construction sites still, and be home at a decent time to spend with my SO. Couldn't be happier. Until 3 weeks later. I received a phone call from the other HR person in the engineering department (who will be called HRGuy from now on).

HRGuy: *""Hey LostMyPassword, I know you don't graduate for another month and a half, but we've got a couple projects that we'd like to get started on, and are wondering if you wouldn't be interested in working part time until you graduate?""*

I had saved up enough money to not work for my last year of college so I could concentrate on my senior design project, which had paid off as we'd finished it much earlier than the deadline called for. So I did have some free time, and the money sounded good.

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *""Sure, I can fit in some time after classes.""*

HRGuy: *""Alright, great. Does Monday work? I'll meet you at Office Site #2 on Monday afternoon to go over the orientation paperwork and get you started if so.""*

So, Monday rolls around, and I head into the office to start my **first job as an ENGINEER**!!! Yeah, I was that geeked out over it, like it was some amazing accomplishment of mediocrity. Stupid when you look back. So, we start to go over the company policies as he reads through them as fast as possible, because they're boring as hell, right? Right.

HRGuy: *""OK, Dress Code - khakis and collared shirt, business casual basically. Good? Good.""*

<Flips page>

HRGuy: *""Sexual harassment policy - don't do it, yada yada, you'll have to sign this here saying you won't, etc. There'll be a more formal part of this when you start full time, There's a whole video and everything you have to watch. This is just so you can get started now. Cool?""*

<Hands me paper, I give it a cursory glance, yep, I won't grab a secretary's ass, got it. Sign, hand back.>

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *""Makes sense.""*

It was at this point that I should've seen that there was a reason that he was moving through this stuff as fast as possible. I'd find out why soon enough.

HRGuy: *""OK, while you're working part time, you'll be on an hourly wage instead of the salary that was agreed on before, which you'll start receiving when you start full time. Sign here.""*

Huh? Seriously, you guys can't pay me the hourly equivalent of what my salary would be when I'm not even 2 months away from graduation, and will be doing the same job that I'll be doing then? (It was about 1/2 rate of what my salary was going to be.) Fuck it, whatever. No biggie, it's only a few weeks, then I'll start making good money. I sign it, hand it back. HRGuy starts rattling off more company policies, but I glaze over slightly, mostly annoyed about the wage thing. Then something caught my ear.

HRGuy: *""And a normal work week at [Company] is considered to be 45 hours, so that's the minimum expected time salary employees are expected to be at the office.""*

Wait. What? [Cue me remembering HRLady](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGH2zNU29FU) 

>*""[Company] is a family oriented company, who believes time with family is *just* as important as the job we do at work. After all, a happy worker is a good worker!""*^After ^all, ^a ^happy ^worker ^is ^a ^good ^worker! ^^a ^^happy ^^worker ^^is ^^a ^^good ^^worker!

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *""I was never informed of this before.""*

HRGuy: *""It should've been discussed in the interview...""*

/u/LostMyPasswordAgain2: *""It wasn't.""*

HRGuy seems to be paused, waiting for a response from me. I take it that he's had this happen before. After about 15 seconds of awkward silence, and me waiting to hear an explanation of this fuck-up of a ""policy"", he continues with other HR like duties to have me hear about and sign.

What the fuck? I'm not happy about this, and to make it worse, It's the end of the semester, all of the jobs I wanted are now filled with other people that applied for them. Looks like I'm gonna be sticking this one out for a bit.

Karma Collecting Pt. 2,33,25ykes,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/25ykes/karma_collecting_pt_2/,5,1400523202.0,"Previous story can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/25qzfj/karma_collecting_pt_1/)

To pick up where I left off from the last story I have been at my new company now for about two and a half years (Time flies!).  About six months ago I got promoted out of IT into a Manager position on the operations end for a newly formed department that required a lot of technical knowledge.

The transition between the two departments (which is a novel on its own) was not the easiest thing, but I was able to get through it clean.  After a few month of developing the department things were getting a bit too heavy in terms of a work load so I put in the request to hire my first employee for the department.

After getting approval I went to go to talk to my old IT supervisor who was in the process of trying to expand the IT department.  I asked him if he could pass onto me the resumes of people that he may not have hired - at least they have already been screened by our recruiter and maybe I could find someone that could be useful for my position.  I needed someone with a technical background but maybe not an expert which was needed for IT.

The next day I had a slew of resumes waiting in my email inbox and I started to go through them.  There were a few that looked promising and others that were not very appealing.  I am almost through them all when I come across *the* resume.  I always start reading through the work experience and education without looking at the name just so I dont start forming opinions based on anything else except their work history and knowledge.

I was going through and this resume looked really good - the person had worked in a collection agency before and did some IT work and had some experience in my new particular department.  I then saw that they worked at my old place of employment so at that point I looked up at the top to see the name of the person.

OldBoss

I just sat and stared there and started to laugh - I knew it was a small world but this sort of stuff happens only in TV shows and movies.  I knew this was my chance to get back.

Normal procedure requires a phone interview before an in person but I forego the phone interview and called our recruiter up and asked her to set up an interview with OldBoss ASAP -- I asked her not to mention my name as the person interviewing since we had a past together I told her I didn't want them to act over confident that they got the job I wanted them to be prepared.  The recruiter agreed and a few hours later I had a interview meeting request in my inbox.

Perfect.

I asked one of the other managers if he would be willing to help me out on my first interview.  I gave him the background of the story and he couldn't stop laughing.  I said I wanted him to interview the guy first as like the first round of interviews and then I would interview him second.  He only agreed if I would tell him what would happen in my interview with OldBoss.

So OldBoss comes in and I make sure I am not seen as he sits with the other manager and ""passes"" the first interview.  The other manager said he asked questions primarily on his knowledge of collections nothing technical so it seemed legit.

The other manager asked him to come back at 2 if it was possible for the second round of interviews as he would then be interviewing with the person that could be his future boss.

2 o'clock came around and OldBoss was on time (a plus) and he was taken to the interview room.  I decided that I would make him wait 15 minutes before I arrived - maybe it was cruel but I wanted to have my bit of fun.

I walk into the interview room at 2:15 and introduce myself

*Me: Hi OldBoss congrats on passing the first round of interviews - I will be interviewing you on other items related to the position that <other manager> did not cover.  Shall we get started?*

*OldBoss: ..uhm wait...uhm*

I wish I could record the look on his face.  It went completely white and he looked like a deer caught in the headlights.  He just sat there with his mount slightly open and silent.

*Me: Shall we proceed?*

*OldBoss: Yes*

*Me: OldBoss - There are several things you can learn on the job here, the work flow operations, the software we use and you will get the opportunity to make changes to these things if it results in higher efficiencies.  Based on your experience I am not really worried about your abilities at all.

My foremost concern is creating an environment of learning, positivity and honesty.  You could be my first hire so I need to start right now in establishing that.  I want this place to be something more than a job.  I want you to want to come into work, but for me to create something like that I need to be able to trust you completely and you trust me.  I would need you to be completely honest and I need to have the other managers here also say the same of you.

Let me ask you Oldboss - has there been anything in any of your old jobs where you may have been accused dishonest or unethical?  If so how did you handle these false accusations?*

*OldBoss: I have not been accused of anything in the past, but had I been I would handle it in a professional manner.*

I was thinking of pressing of asking him what he means be a professional manner but I let it slide.  At this point he probably had sweat out about 2 liters of water.

*Me: I see - now something we take very seriously here is sexual harrassment.  This position will require you to go through the manager's sexual harrasment training and not the employee one.  While you will not be any of the agent's direct supervisor or manager you will have some measure of authority over them so thats why its required.  The demographic of our call center agents are primarily female aged 18-25 - this would not be an issue for you, would it?*

*OldBoss: Not at all*

*Me: Good to hear the last thing I would want is to have an employee have a 'fling' or 'one night stand' with another employee.  It causes a lot of drama and headaches.  Trust me at one of my old employers I had my boss sleeping around with the head of HR.  Could you believe something like that - the head of HR and my boss?  Anyways good to hear that - I really want a positive working team here - now lets move on.

I see that you use to be a Manager and Director yourself - why do you want to move down from management?*

His face was the palest I have ever seen and he was super uncomfortable.  I could tell her wanted out but I wanted to keep him in there as long as I could.

*OldBoss: Its not so much that I want to move down, but its not easy to get those type of jobs so right now I want to get something that I know I will do well in to move back into those roles.*

*Me: If you don't mind me asking - why were you let go from your last position?*

*OldBoss: We were bought out by a company and my job position became redundant so after a year I was let go.*

*Me: Hmm - you did have a full year to show your value though - interesting.

So you had originally applied for an IT position here but this position isnt strictly IT - its more about operational items and some technical reasoning and logic.  Is this something you would really want to do?  Or is IT going to be something you will still want to do?*

*OldBoss: IT is where my heart is, but I love new challenges and want to succeed at everything I put my all into.  I like the fact that this is a new department and will be growing - I want to be part of that growth.*

*Me: One last thing and I will let you go.  I am a little over 10 years younger than you - would that be an issue?  Have you had a younger boss before?  Again I rather you be completely honest over giving me the answer I would like to hear because I have seen it before and even here sometimes people have a hard time with a boss thats much younger than they are.*

*OldBoss: I am young at heart so things like that really do not make a difference to me.  Each person is different and thats what matters.  I rather have a great boss who is 20 years younger than me than a horrible boss who is older.*

*Me: What about a former employee -- I was your employee for a long time do you think that would be possible?*

At this point OldBoss was completely speechless he had wetspots under his arms and they wre about the size of cantaloupes.  He didnt say anything at all to that question and just looked down.

I decided to let him go - he already was going through a rough time having lost his job I didnt want to rub it in more.  

As I was escorting him out of the building he kept looking down and couldnt look me in the face.  

*Me: OldBoss - I know you treated me like shit before I left.  I know thats why you can't look me in the face right now, but I do want to let bygones by bygones.  Honestly you are beyond qualified for this job and I do want to hire you, I just dont know if you would be willing to take the job.  I honestly would not seek to get back at you for anything done in the past.  I think Karma has more than taken care of that part for me.  I just want someone who will work hard and be honest.  If you are willing to do that the job is yours - let me know in the next 48 hours if you wish to accept it or not.*

OldBoss finally looked up - he had a look of shock on his face.  What I had said was true - he was the most qualified and would probably do quite well - Life had brought him down and humbled him to a point where he was willing to work hard again.

*OldBoss: Wait, really?  I will need some time to think about it.  I will let you know soon.  Thank you for the offer.*

He extended his hand out and I shook it and we went our separate ways.

The next night I received an email from OldBoss.  He apologized profusely over his behavior and told me everything that had happened since I left.  The old HR head moved on from him and found a different 'sugar daddy' for herself and his marriage was barely holding on by a thread. He wanted to move on from everything that he did and had happened to him past few years.  As much as he needs the job and knows its a good opportunity for him he would not be able to come in every day and look me in the face.  The guilt would be too much for him still.  He thanked me for the chance and that he was happy that I was able to move on and up with my career and wished me nothing but success.


I replied thanking him for his honesty and accepting his apology and that if he ever needed him he was more than welcome to reach out.

And with that Karma had closed the loop on this crazy chapter in my work life.  I ended up hiring a different person who has been amazing and I do not regret for a moment hiring.

Karma Collecting Pt. 1,37,25qzfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/25qzfj/karma_collecting_pt_1/,6,1400279559.0,"Quick Background:

I worked as tech support for a collection agency for five years - I've seen my share of nonsense all around.  Part 1 of this story deals directly with myself and my ex-boss.  He was the head of IT and was the one who hired me.  For the first two years there he was a good boss, I learned a lot (albeit self-taught) and was starting to make a career for myself in the tech/IT world.  During the last year though my relationship with my boss changed completely and this is where I start my tale.....

It was a breezy spring day - I remember it vividly I had just come back in from picking up some snacks from the 7-11 down the street.  Looking on my list of things to do I saw I had a pending ticket to check one one of the tape backups that should have completed.  My boss generally came in a lot later in the day (around 11am) than I did, but he was the boss he could do as he pleased I felt.

I started on my way to our server room, its a small closet of servers in there.  The room could hold three people at max, but it was a small size company so there wasn't a need for racks and racks of equipment.  As I worked the KVM switch on the console in the server room to connect to the backup machine I switched over to our camera system.  We had cameras all over our main suite and we had three cameras in a secondary suite that used to be a second office, but after downsizing was just used as a storage facility.

Something was off though today - the lights were on in the other suite - that never happens only 4 people have access to that suite.  Myself, my boss, the owner of the company and the head of HR/accountant (its a small company so people wore multiple hats)

As the feed rotated between cameras angles - I found out why the lights were on - my boss was in there along with the head of HR.

She was on her knees - he was standing up - her head bobbing up and down -- you get the picture of what was going on.

I felt a knot in my stomach - I mean like every guy I've seen my fair share of porn and all but I had no interest in seeing my boss getting 'serviced' by her of all people.  Not to mention my boss was married with two kids.

I quickly switched to the backup machine went about doing the rest of my tasks and hurried back to my desk to continue my day the best I could.  I told myself that whatever they do is really none of my business and I shouldnt get involved.  More importantly who could I go to? HR -- she was the one who was on her knees!!

A few months pass and my boss and her are basically in that other room almost every day for an extended period of time.  It started to effect my job as people kept looking for my boss and couldn't find him.  I was getting dumped with more and more work as he wasnt able to do his end of things so left them for me to do.  After a while it was pretty obvious to the whole office what was going on between the two of them but since the company was on thin ice no one said anything as my boss and her were two people the company needed to stay afloat.


I started to look for other jobs as my boss started to treat me really bad during this whole sequence.  Subtle jabs at my performance (which was great but he kept putting down so he could justify not giving me a raise) and not so subtle jabs at my life at the time.  I was in my late 20s and was getting by but I was single and being able to be completely financially independent/debt free was still some time away considering how little I was getting paid at the time.  But it was a tough time to even have a job so I did my best not to complain.

After a few months of dead end interviews and offers of jobs that paid less and worked me more I finally landed a great new job that paid me significantly more and gave me a lot more responsibilities and new tasks.

My new employer wanted me to start the next day but I felt it was proper to at least give 2 weeks at my old job.  I didn't really feel I owed it to my now old boss but the owner of the company was always great to me and always took care of me and if anything I felt I owed him the courtesy of two weeks.

I walked in the next day with my resignation letter typed up and I handed it to my old boss.  He looks over it and reads it and just shrugs his shoulders and sets it aside and doesn't say a word.  I sit down at my desk just adjacent to his and get started on my day - at this point I have also emailed HR and the owner about my two weeks as well.  After 45 minutes of quiet I finally speak up:

*Me: uhm, so OldBoss did you want to talk about my resignation letter?*
*OldBoss: Whats there to talk about?  Are you leaving for more money?  If you think you can get a raise here by threaten to leave - think again buddy.*

I was shocked - I know plenty of people leverage that but I never have nor do I ever want to pull that sort of stunt.  Even if the new job paid the same amount or just a little more I would have left for the opportunity of growth there - getting a 28% increase in pay was the proverbial icing on the cake.

*Me: No - its not about the money I will be getting paid more at my new employer but its time I moved on there is nothing left for me here to learn and I have to think more about whats best for me going forward.  They actually wanted me to start today, but I said I need to put in two weeks I didn't want to leave without helping you transition and possibly help train a new hire or even you on some of my daily tasks*

At this point my old boss calls the HR lady and asks her to come into our office

*OldBoss: I don't know if I need to hire anyone I am sure I can handle everything you do and not have to spend money on someone new.  I know you don't want to hear that but its true.  Oh here is HR Lady -- hey so techcollector is giving his two week notice so he says just wanted to let you know*

*HRLady: oh yeah he emailed me.  So you are leaving?  You know you wont be able to be on those websites and chat with your friends all day like you are here.  You'll be expected to do actual work.  You sure about wanting to leave?*

I was about to go off on them but thats what they wanted I somehow kept my patience and replied

*Me: yeah it will be nice not having to kill time by having to do all that I'll be challenged and will be doing a lot of new things at the new place so I am looking forward to it.  I was just telling OldBoss that maybe he should put up a job posting for a replacement so I can help train before I leave.*

*HRLady: Maybe if you showed some initiative you could have been asked to do more here*

At this point I did lose it 

*Me: Sorry maybe I should have just fucked my way up to the top right?*

That just cut through the air and it was dead silent.  I knew I probably shouldn't have said that but it hit home.  The HR Lady left the office right there in a huff and my boss was quiet the rest of the day.

The rest of the week passes by and its the following Monday - no job posting has gone up.  I ask my boss if he plans to put it up because if he doesnt plan to then if it would be ok for me to just leave now since I would like to start at my new job asap.  He laughed and said he knew I wasn't going any where and that I should be more worried about doing my current job than some make pretend job I have.

I was thinking of quitting right there but I had a week left - I rather not say I quit a job like that in the future and I felt it would be far sweeter to go through the motions of getting my final check and all on the final day and leaving with no replacement and no way for me to not tell them 'I told you so!'

The next day though the HR dept from my new company called my old company for employment verification and to have some paper work faxed over.  Standard stuff I was in the office working when HRLady came storming in.

*HRLady: Where is OldBoss?*

*Me: Its 10 am when was the last time he got here before 11?  He 
should be here in an hour.  Why something urgent?*

*HRLady: I need to talk to him right away when he comes in.  You better not waste a second in letting me know when he gets in*

She storms off and I am not sure why she was all in a tiff, but an hour later my old boss shows up and I tell him HR Lady was looking for him. 

She walks into our office and I get asked to leave the room.  I leave and I am just chilling with some co-workers and I walk over to HR Lady's office and was talking to the other accountant who shares an office with HRLady.  Acct was one of my few friends in the office and she was super happy I was leaving she couldnt wait to leave herself.

*Acct: Oh man techcollector you really did it now.*

*Me: What did I do?*

*Acct: You're quitting! That's what!  She didn't believe you but we got a bunch of calls and faxes from your new company requested certain documents to be sent over ASAP today and it freaked her out.  She screamed actually - 'He's actually fucking going that asshole!""*

*Me: So I guess they never took my word and my letter I sent over a week ago - it took that phone call to get it through their heads.  She is talking to OldBoss right now - probably over that.*

I go back into the office I see OldBoss frantically putting up job postings all over every free website for postings he can.

*Me: So you're going to hire someone after all then I take it?*

*OldBoss: Yeah well you aren't given us much time here to find someone good*

*Me: Well I told you last week, you chose to waste a week not believing thats not my fault.  I will help train whoever you hire up until the 28th but after that I am gone.*

Over the next day people come in to interview and a guy is selected I have 3 days to train him.

I spend the days training him - he didn't seem too enthused by all the various processing tasks - 1/2 the job was on report processing and handling of new accounts and the other half was IT.  I am not sure how the job presented itself but he kept asking about various IT aspects that the job didnt really include.

My Final Day - OldBoss is happy to see me go.  He was able to hire someone at less pay and would do everything I had did.  He stops being subtle with his jabs and is now constantly just making fun of my abilities and talents.  I felt kind of bad for him having to do that but I do my best not to bite back at him.

Its just before lunch I look at the new guy and ask him if there is anything else he wants help with and he says no.  I ask OldBoss then if I can just call it a day and get my final check and go home.  I would like to just take it easy and maybe get a massage before I start my new job the next day.

OldBoss is surprisingly agreeable to this but says instead of paying me 8 hours for the day that he was going to have the final check cut for the 4 hours I was there.  I was fine with that though it was always customary to pay the full day even if the employee went home early on their final day as a final gesture of good will and faith.

As I left the parking garage I told myself - never again from him.  I dont care if he calls, texts, emails - there is no way I will ever contact or talk to this person again in my life.  After all he put me through and quite frankly all that I took (and shouldn't have) I have no reason to entertain him ever again.


And then Karma came knocking...

I am at the masseuse when I hear my phone go off.  Judging by the ring tone I realize its OldBoss and I let it go.  The phone does not stop ringing - the masseuse asks if I would like to pick it up - I said to her to hand me the phone so I can turn it off.  Sure enough besides the 4 phone calls there were several texts.    I get 5 more phone calls and several texts and ignore them all.

The next day I am at my new job and I get a text from Acct asking me to call her on my lunch break so I did.

*Acct: So you have to hear this.  You wont believe what happened after you left yesterday?*

*Me: I am curious because OldBoss kept calling me over and over and sent me a ton of texts I havent read them yet but I can only imagine its related*

*Acct: Yeah!  So about an hour after you left.  The NewGuy - your replacement came back from lunch and quit right on the spot.  Said the job wasn't what was describe in the ad and that it would be a step back for his IT path if he was there.  OldBoss was livid because he had no idea what to do and couldnt train any one new.  He has been going all over the office this morning trying to figure out things.  We have our clients demanding to know why their things are not ready and what happened to you the whole thing.  OldBoss is completely losing it and the owner is not happy.*

*Me: wait really? he quit? thats freaking awesome.  Karma really bit OldBoss in the ass there.  I haven't picked up a single phone call or responded to a single text and I dont plan to.  this is could not have worked out better or happened to a nicer guy.*

*Acct: the owner has been on him all morning demanding whats going on and HRLady is taking some of the heat of it as well since you took care of some of the reports she needed.  Oh its a glorious mess all of it.*

And with that I was happy - I didn't have to get back at my old boss - Karma took care of it for me.  I just didnt expect it to happen that fast though.

But Karma wasnt done with my old boss.... that is going to be in part 2",2014-05-17 01:32:39

My descent into workplace hell Pt. 1,40,25jwoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/25jwoh/my_descent_into_workplace_hell_pt_1/,5,1400088250.0,"2011, Fresh faced designer, having graduated from architecture school in 2010. Did internships during college, but just landed a job at an up-and-coming architecture firm. Interview went great; got real casual with the two owners - knew I would get the job. They asked me what I wanted to make. I said $17-$18 an hour. Thought that was fair based on what my graduate program classmates were making.  
  
Boss 1, let's call him Joe.  
""Don't undervalue yourself!""  
  
Wow... I think.  
""What am I worth to you?"" I ask.  

""$26-$32.""  
  
Jesus Christ. ""Awesome,"" I say.  
  
Long interview story short, they wrap it up, and call me like a month later to offer me the job. They e-mail me an offer letter, and to my surprise the salary is listed at $24,000 annually, or around $11.50 an hour, for a college graduate with internships under her belt. (That paid much more, too.) 
  
I call them back and ask what's up with the salary.  
  
Boss 2, let's call him Mike.  
""That's all we can offer you. I'm sorry.""  
  
Me, thinking I need this job in order to get credit with my graduate program and for ADP (architecture licensure exams), begrudgingly accepts.  
  
Start my first day. Seems like a good place, except for the really cold treatment I am getting from my new bosses for having asked about the salary. Finally, later in the day, thy bring me into the conference room and announce they have raised my salary to $26,000 annually. I was slightly happier, but felt I was still worth way more -- according to my classmates and payscale.com.  
  
Every day I was learning more (decided to write it off as a learning experience). Mike is really cold towards me still, treats me with hostility. Joe is a very casual, easy going guy, who was a bit sleazy with the casual attitude that was a cover for his games. There's a couple other employees, all male. I'm the only female.  
  
I'm working my ass off, staying late, coming in early, and being an all-around awesome employee. I start to notice that I have to try harder anyway, because it's a boys club. (There was one female who left just prior to me starting..... which was convenient.... I'll explain why later.)  
  
The guys chatted a lot. Things like ""Females should have to take an exam to have a baby"" were said by my boss, Joe. I sat there, clearly uncomfortable, ignoring them. They were all about the ""cool atmosphere and cool people"" so they only hired people they thought would fit the bill. Mike said similar things about how women getting a degree is a waste because they'll just end up having a baby and never go back into the field. The list went on and on.  

An intern student guy starts working there, seemingly doing a great job, but come to find out, he was half-assing all his great work. We didn't find out till after when we would have to go into the files and everything was a rats nest and virtually a disaster. It's my job to work on it, therefore it's my job to fix it. I spend nights until 1 AM working on it, for days. One day, before it's finished, I come in and my computer is logged in with the file open. My boss takes me into the conference room to tell me I made an awful file and how all my other work is poor too. I give point after point and reason after reason how I am good. And I explain how this kid fucked it up, and I was fixing it.  
  
A couple weeks later, I receive an e-mail about how I fucked something else up, that was sent to the whole office. I wasn't even working on this project. I was humiliated. I had walked into work on my birthday to be lectured and yelled at, when I was working my ass off - and I knew I was doing well.  
  
So, at another point, I find out from a coworker that does the same job as me that he makes double what I make. I find out my bosses give themselves $115k each in salaries while I am making $12.50 an hour for an entire year, aka $26,000, and can never ask for a raise because they find problems with me just in time for each review. The interns made $12.00** (fixed to correct pay, sorry) an hour. I was a full time employee with health insurance (that I paid half for, in addition) and more prior experience than most people who came into my job with.

At that point, and with dozens and dozens of comments that were utterly degrading and inappropriate, I decidedly to file a discrimination complaint. I wait days for them to get it, before I say anything - because without receiving the letter, they can claim they fired me for other reasons than from receiving the letter. (It's illegal to fire me after getting it.)

They take me into the conference room and tell me they are utterly confused as to what happened and how they feel betrayed. I tell them about the pay, about the comments I kept record of, and everything. They claimed they thought I was asking for $17,000-$18,000 annually. I told them that didn't even make sense because that's either at or below minimum wage. They claimed they didn't understand it either, and I called them out on what they originally said I was worth. They said they meant $26,000 to $32,000, to which I responded, you originally offered me $24,000. They had no good reasoning for any of it.

So, I told them I am taking them to court for all the emotional damage they inflicted, as well as for everything else. (They had had me in tears for degradation many times, that weren't my fault, and were made public. But they never did it to the guys.) All the stress and crying caused gall bladder issues to surface in a way that sent me to the ER, etc.

I get to mediation, which had to come before court. They somehow have the mediator, who is supposed to have no bias, on their side. She's telling me that by not asking them if I was paid less because I am a woman made my point invalid. She told me my case wasn't worth even a couple thousand. In the end, I came out with about $6k, which made my salary that year $32,000. I accepted because court fees and time were honestly too much, and in reality, it at least made my salary the higher end of what they claim they said I was worth... Anyhow.

Later on, I found out that the woman who worked there before me left because she was pissed off, too. It turns out they needed to have a woman at the company at all times for tax benefit reasons, and that's why I was hired when it was such a male oriented place. 

Just as a point, I currently work in an all male place, and the guys are great. I've been here 2 years. I would never think to automatically go to court over something like this - but after being yelled at, treated awfully, etc., I did it as a last resort. If I had quit, I would not have been entitled to my dues.

Micromanagement at its finest,39,24sw54,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/24sw54/micromanagement_at_its_finest/,2,1399320150.0,"A few years back right after I graduated high school, I landed a job at a small non-profit organization I will call DerpCorp as a Database Administrator (most of my job ended up being file clerk in the end). My job mainly consisted of managing our small MS Access database, making occasional changes, inputting data, and basically making sure the system was up and running. The rest of my job was filling away our client files at each of the offices (a job that could be finished within about an hour).

DerpCorp's purpose was good enough, helping those in need in the community and for a short time I actually felt proud to work there.

Soon enough though, I started to learn how bad the company actually was...

The office had about maybe 100 employees and had several small offices across our state with about a dozen employees in each office. Due to the companies size, the entirety of IT was managed by one person who we will name ITManager. He would normally work from home, and rarely ever showed up at the office, and we he did he always acted bitter and angry.

I worked the only other tech related job at the company so anytime a tech question came up I would try to help, but would then get berated by management because it wasn't within my job description/duties..

Lets start with the main villain of this story, she was the Director of Quality Assurance and managed my position and about a dozen other people. We will call her QAManager.

QAManager was a mousy lady, spoke very faintly, normally fairly pleasant to be around at first until you actually got some time to work with her...

As I said before, my job was fairly limited, so constantly I would find myself finished with my daily workload and would ask her if she had anything else for me to do. She would respond ""Just find something to do"", so I would go around seeing if any of the other departments needed help with anything, and when nothing came up, I would go back to my desk and browse the web (facebook, at the time digg, twitter) to pass the time.

It was about a few weeks in while working that I was called into her office. I walked in and noticed she had a stern look on her face as I sat down in front of her.

QAManager: Gunhaxx I called you in here because I was told by ITManager that you accessed non-work related sites on company time.

Me: I did yes, but it was only during downtime when I had no other tasks assigned for me to work on, and they were only sfw sites.

QAManager: That is unacceptable! You are only allowed to use your work computer and internet for work related reasons. If I catch you again accessing non-work related sites you will be reprimanded.

Note this was before the smart phone era, so all I had was your standard flip phone with no apps or internet

Me: Alright I understand and it will not happen again, but what do you want me to do when I have finished all of my work?

QAManager: I don't care as long as its work! Clean if you must!

Me: ....that's not part of my job description...

QAManager: You will do as I say, you should be thankful for this job....Oh and I will also need your work computer password..

Me: wait what?! Why do you need my work computer password?

QAManager: To make sure you are only using your computer for work, everyone in the office is now required to give me their computer passwords so I can make sure no body is slacking off.

Me:....ok....

So after the meeting I brought the issue up to HR and the ITManager and this ruling was approved, so now everyone had to give QAManager their work passwords so she could ""effectively manage"".

A few days later I came in a little bit early then everyone else, as I pulled into the parking lot I noticed QAManagers car already parked.

I walked into the reception area of the office and heard mumbling coming from the back of the office.

I slowly walked to the back cubicle area and found the QAManager sitting at one of my co-workers desks on their computer, checking their browsing history and work email account.

She turned to me to give a sneer and went back to looking around on the co-workers computer.

About a week later we were all called into an all-hands meeting with the QAManager at the lead.

QAManager: As you all know, we have been keeping close tabs on everyone's email and browser history and that company policy is that all company equipment must be used for work related purposes only...I have found that all of you are misusing your company provided equipment for personal use...thus to put a stop to this non-sense we are blocking all access to the internet from your company computers. If you need do any work related research you must do it from my workstation with under my watch...

All of my co-workers including myself groaned in unison

QAManager: Also! To prevent fooling around at work, we are banning all personal cell phones, music players, radios or any other personal electronic devices from the office. Please leave your personal electronics in the car before coming into the office..",2014-05-05 23:02:30
Tales from Transportation IV: What happens at the managers' retreat.....,21,230pyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/230pyl/tales_from_transportation_iv_what_happens_at_the/,2,1397496734.0,"In 2007 I worked as a recruiter at a major US Trucking company.  These are the tales from that job.

So it's middle of the summer, and as is the normal, the directors go away for a big summit meeting/team building retreat to discuss the outlook on driver retention vs hires, to set the projection for what we actually need vs what we're generating, and whose division is getting more heads (and have a little work party atmosphere without the rest of us).

Like the old adage goes: if the parents are away, the kids will play.  No directors and no VPs on the floor meant food days, Nerf football toss, Youtube, Facebook, and all the other trappings of having a free office.  I got beaned in the head twice with a nerf ball, on the 2nd time it went into my desk and stayed there.  Other than that, it was a week of excellence.  People were de-stressed and we actually got MORE done than usual.

Then the management team comes back and we had to put the toys away (GROOOOOAN!)  But there was something different.  Not one manager would talk openly about their meeting, or any projection, the only answer was ""get back to work"".

There was one manager in particular (whom I'll refer to as GM) that did not return for 3 weeks....and several people asked where he was but no answer was given.  

It wasn't until much later that I had found a memo to me from one of my soon-to-be laid off coworkers (as was I to be) about what happened.  It turns out that GM had a few too many drinks and passed out in his hotel room.  His dickhead roommate (DM, who was a floor VP at the time) decided it would be funny to disrobe, draw on the skin of, spray shaving cream on, and take pictures of GM.  He THEN went on to get a bunch of other directors (including female directors) to his hotel room and parade them around naked, passed out GM.  When GM came to, he was visibly and very noticeably angered, but DM and the other VP on the trip had told everyone to keep quiet or lose their jobs.

WEEEEELLLLLLL we get to the point in time where people are getting laid off, and one of the managers to be laid off writes a memo to the CEO, outlining what happened that week.  An investigation is launched, as are lawsuits, and DM is fired.  The other VP that threatened everyone with their jobs gets knocked down a couple pay grades, and other people get disciplinary action on their records.  GM ended up leaving the company.

TL;DR- A job-related offsite retreat function is no excuse to go Animal House on someone.",2014-04-14 20:32:14
My Unhappy Return...,55,21q7rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/21q7rm/my_unhappy_return/,7,1396156318.0,"A few years ago, I was working for a retail company's corporate office.  I was one of three people in my position and the most senior in that position, the 3rd guy was hired on the day this happened.  My cubical was fully stocked in supplies.  The day the third person was hired on (A Friday) I was rear ended in a horrible multi-car wreck.  It wasn't my fault, I was the first car hit and hit so hard that I was slammed into the car in front of me.  To make it worse, the freeway was closed down for another wreck, I was at a complete stop and the car that hit me was going approximately 50 MPH.


So I was on short term disability for three months.  Kind of needed to recover from rather severe injuries.  I knew that they had hired on a temp to cover for me while I was out.  I gave notice to my bosses that I was returning the week before I did.  


When I returned I found that the temp wasn't actually a temp, but she was going to not only remain in my cubical, but she was also going to remain in my job.  I was put into an empty cubical.  Well, not only was it empty, but it was the cubical that we had used for trash.  There was a chair in that cubical and the chair's cushion was stained, ripped, and most of the padding had been removed, the arm rests were destroyed.  It was one of the most uncomfortable chairs that I had ever sat on.  The chair was placed in that cubical because we had no where else to put it and my bosses had been working on getting that chair thrown away.  I had no computer, phone, pens, or any other item needed to complete my job.  I asked my supervisor: ""When can I expect to get supplies to do my job?""


Supervisor: ""I don't know.""


Me: ""So what is my job?""


Supervisor: ""Same job you had before you left.""


Me: ""When is the temp leaving so I can take my old cubical?""


Supervisor: ""She's not leaving and that's not your cubical.""


Me: ""So when, again, am I going to get the supplies to do my job?""


Supervisor: ""I don't know""


Me: ""Do I have a job anymore?""


Supervisor: ""Why would you ask that?""


Me: ""There is a woman who was hired to take my job while I was out following medical leave for injuries inflicted on me by a driver too dangerous to drive, and 
now that woman is in my cubical, still doing my job and I have no supplies, not even a chair to sit in.  I think the question of 'Do I have a job?' is a valid one.""


Supervisor: ""You have a chair.""


Me: ""We tried throwing that chair away.  You don't get to spend over a year trying to throw away a chair and then give it to me and tell me it's as good as anyone else's.""


Supervisor: ""Today you're job is going to this list, find the documents on this list and scan them.""


Me: ""And where are these documents located?""


This is a common part of busy work of the job.  Each week we, for tax purposes, had to scan every document that came across our desks.  The Supervisor ran a list whenever busy work was needed to see what wasn't scanned and have someone go through the files and pull the documents and re-scan them.  The Supervisor leads me to an empty cubical, with a perfectly good chair, here's the documents, pointing to twenty plus boxes stacked up.  Now, my supervisor visited me when I was in the hospital the day after the wreck.  She knew as well as anyone else that in that wreck I broke BOTH my shoulders.  I even had shoulder surgery on my right shoulder (and I am...or at least was...right handed).  


Me: ""Seriously?""


Supervisor: ""This was part of your job before and you have the document from your doctor saying you're fit to do your job.""


Me: ""I'm still in physical therapy, I'm coming back from breaking two shoulders and half my ribs and your first job is to have me pick up and move heavy boxes when it should be a physical lite job of mostly sitting?""


Supervisor: ""You don't have a computer to do your job on.""


Me: ""There's three people in my position who aren't me.  One of  them is a man about my age who looks to be healthy enough to do a physical job.  Seems to me you can have him do this and I can do my primary job.""


Supervisor: ""I'm not doing that.""  And she walks off. 


Me, I look at the chair in this empty cubical, I remember my ""new"" chair and figure, ""This cubical is empty, no one is using this chair, my chair sucks.""  So I push this chair out of the cubical.  The supervisor sees this and stops me.


Supervisor asks what I'm doing and I explain to her what I'm doing.  She says ""That chair is for managers.  You can't have it, you have a chair.""


Me: ""If you believe that my chair is as good enough for anyone to use, then you use it.  Use it for today and today only and I will drop it forever.""


Supervisor: ""No, put this chair back, and return to work.""


So I put the chair back and look at my list and the boxes.  My arm is still stiff at the elbow and at the shoulder it still hurts, and I can no longer feel it.  In order to do the job that I have to do, I have to move one box from one side of the cubical to the other in order to open it.  Worse, the first box I needed wasn't on top.  I don't do this quickly or quietly.  Three months prior this would have been nothing.  On this day, it felt like I was moving boulders.  


A couple hours later my Director summons me over to her.  Confused I walk up to her.  This is the first time I've seen her since the day of the car wreck.  She has me follow her to HR.  It seems my supervisor made a complaint to HR and my Director about me and my attitude.  So I'm sitting in the office of the HR VP.


HR: ""What is your problem today?""


Me: ""I'm having a hard time believing that I still have my old job?""


HR: ""Why would you say that?""


Me: ""I'm no longer in my old cubical, I have no computer, phone, supplies, not even an ink pen, my chair is the chair we tried throwing away and if it were possible for us to have chucked it into a trash bin we wouldn't have it.  What I do is a three person job, there are three people doing my job and no plans to move any of them, so honestly, do I  have my old job?""


HR: ""What did you come back?  I'm not sure you might be healthy enough to return to work yet?""


Me: ""I'm back because I got the call last week saying to return or be fired.  It seems you weren't expecting me back.""


Director: ""Janitor, you do have your job.""


HR: ""Why are you making such a big deal over a chair?""


Me: ""I'm here for 8 hours a day, 8 of those I will spend in that chair.  Eight and a half if I decide to eat lunch at my desk.  Why is it unreasonable to want a comfortable chair?""


HR: ""There is no budget for any more chairs for your department.""


Me: ""Here in HR you have more cubicals, computers and chairs than you have people.""


HR: ""We are expanding.""


Me: ""So at least temporarily you have a computer and chair to loan my department.""


HR: ""That's not how things work.""


Me: ""Do you know how asinine it is that I can't even get a chair?""


HR: ""You have a chair.""


Me: ""Have you seen this chair?""


HR: ""I still don't understand your anger right now?""


Me: ""If I took this to the work force commission and expressed my concern to them that I feared I was replaced while I was on medical leave.  Explained to them that there is a new permanent employee who was hired on while I was on medical leave to sit in my cubical to do my job and I'm in a storage cubical with no supplies and a trashed chair, do you think they'd see it my way that I was replaced?""


HR to Director: ""Janitor doesn't have a computer at all?""


Director: ""That's correct.""


HR: ""Janitor, we are happy that you are back.  We were shocked at what happened and happy that you survived and was able to return.  I'm concerned for you.  Take the rest of today off, with pay, and you can remain at home with pay, until you have the needed supplies.  I just don't know how long it will take.""  He then handed me information about a thing about seeing a shrink.


I return upstairs to my cubical to grab my stuff and find a new chair and that trash chair missing.  I grab my belongings and one of my VPs show up at my cubical.  


VP: ""Janitor, welcome back.""


Me: ""Thank you.""


VP: ""I heard about what happened.""


Me: ""I am able to do my job.""


VP: ""I know, I was actually talking about you and your chair and cubical.""


Me: ""Yeah, that's why I'm going home until I have a computer.""


VP: ""You're right, that chair wasn't fit for anyone to use and I'm sorry you had to go through that.""


Me: ""Thank you, you have no idea how happy I am to hear that SOMEONE agrees with me.""


VP: ""That's why I went down to HR and stole one of their chairs for you.""


Me, shocked: ""Thank you.  But they said...""


VP: ""Don't worry about that, this is your chair now.  You can't steal chairs, but I can.""


Me: ""Thank you.""

Venting and a plea for advice on a terribly managed company,25,20evb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/20evb2/venting_and_a_plea_for_advice_on_a_terribly/,10,1394815048.0,"My current position is a customer service/reception/accounting/administrative/shipping/whatever my bosses want to stack on me position.  I don't mind having many hats I actually welcome the opportunity to gain experience in multiple areas and I have always sought jobs that could promise that I would stay busy because I absolutely hate downtime at work.  I work at a photo processing lab that deals directly with professional photographers and has been in business for 30-40 years now.  I've worked here for about 2 years now and it has deteriorated very quickly.  When I was hired, my coworker told me immediately ""this place is horrible to work at.  If you can find a different job....find one.""  I didn't heed her advice because at the time I was making a 1.5 hour drive to work every morning and afternoon and was making less than this place was offering me.  I thought I could deal with a little bullshit.

I learned the software and the products to the same if not higher level than my aforementioned coworker within about 2 weeks.  I had no training at all.  I was given a sheet of paper that told how to run credit cards and a catalog to study.  Every single day I was expected to dress to work in a front desk from 8 to 5 and then go to shipping to help them from 5 to about 8 pm.  A little bit of training back there mostly because ~300 of our customers had special instructions for shipping and I was shown the list of those special instructions.  The money was nice especially since it was now a 15 minute commute instead.

At first it was just little things.  Having actual disciplinary meetings over things I didn't know was incorrect....most of those disciplinary actions were doled out to my by my coworker...not my manager.  Angry customers.  I was falsely under the impression that dealing with photographers instead of directly to the public would mean there were less angry people.  All of these people would call in because the pictures we sent them were wrong or were damaged....or we printed a photo on a mug upside down and shipped it to them like that.  

These things SHOULDN'T have been issues because we have a devoted quality assurance team.  I was told...""we do a large volume...mistakes are bound to happen.""  That rubbed me the wrong way because there was never any action taken to make the accuracy higher at all.  There was a digital log that was there for each person along the way to sign off on that they had completed a task (presumably for tracking and for accountability) but nobody used it...or if they did they used it sporadically.  We are talking about an 80% accuracy rating by my estimation (based on phone calls and emails versus actual volume) and I just don't feel like that is acceptable at all.  

So our accuracy is down...we must be very fast right?  Wrong....we quote a 3 day turnaround for most jobs and some of them we'll get out in 2 days and some won't get out for a week and a half.  A week and a half with no documentation on where the job is located within the company except for a printed stack of papers that travel through the building with the job.  Certainly nothing I can see when a customer calls to ask for their order status.  

During downtime of our slower season I created a training manual for the front office.  It had a training schedule, text and graphic based training on each of our 5 software systems (3 customer order based, 1 order entry based and 1 accounting), training on every single duty that I had been expected to perform at one point or another and it had a reference section for common questions.  

My coworker left shortly after that and my boss had me advertise on craigslist.  I did and we didn't get many good applicants so I posted over to my city's job board on Reddit and I found my current coworker there.  She was very optimistic and said that I was just being negative and it wasn't so bad.  We both get in trouble multiple times for answering questions for prospective customers when neither the owner nor our manager would pick up the phone.  She starts realizing how little we matter to anybody else in the company.

Business started stalling really bad at this point; the owner and the self-appointed operations manager were going to be gone for a week at a photo expo.  I sent the operations manager an email giving him a breakdown of accuracy and accountability problems.  I gave him details, possible solutions (none of them would have been an additional cost) and told him that I would gladly do anything I could to help out because I see the issue as being more in line with us losing good customers with shoddy work rather then us needing to attract more and more customers.  I told what I saw as problems in the company from my point of view and he agreed with me and said he was making a plan to talk to the owner about making some changes and I had a lot of great ideas that he would bring up as well.

He gets back and my manager hands my coworker and me a stack of papers with names and phone numbers and tells us to make cold calls.  This rubbed me the wrong way because....we weren't told what to say to these people AND....we'd been in trouble for answering questions CORRECTLY for prospects that called US.  My coworker accepts the stack and makes phone calls and does a great job.  She gets a 40% rate of return on people.  She has to fill out by hand...a form with their address and sample requests.  I create a PDF form that she can just tab through and type in.  I make it set up exactly like the sheets we had been using for years.  My manager hates them....prefers the handwritten.  The owner (who gathers the sample packets and catalogs himself) doesn't have a problem so for sake of ease and to keep legibility we keep using the form. It becomes obvious very quickly that we can't both be making calls because then there's nobody to answer phones and we get in trouble for not getting the phone.  SO we agree that since she does so well at it she will continue making the calls and I will see if I can find more information on the names that don't have phone numbers or email them if I can't.  This allows me to also answer the phones and direct the calls while still contributing.  

Manager bitches....I do not use that term lightly....he does not come to me to tell me his issues with this he complains to other people that I'm not doing enough work.  Coworker gets wind of it and tells him exactly what I'm doing and tells him that we are trying to make sure the phones are covered.  

I notice that this list of names and phone numbers has a lot of duplicates and it isn't in any sort of order so I start typing it into a spreadsheet along with addresses that we have gotten for people that requested a catalog.  THEN I find out that the operations manager sent this list IN a spreadsheet format to my manager to begin with.  My manager chose to delete the column that already had address information in it and print it out 3 times (43 sheets of paper each).  I ask the operations manager to send that spreadsheet to us and I go ahead and get rid of duplicates, combine married couples and partnerships, and create a graphical interface that shows which customers wanted catalogs, which were emailed, which we left messages on....so on and so forth.  Suddenly this whole thing becomes so much easier.

My coworker is now getting in trouble daily.  Too many calls made and the owner can't keep up...too few made.  Too much this too much that.  It becomes too much and she confides in me that she's close to quitting.  I tell her I understand and I'm planning on doing it myself when my boyfriend gets into grad school and we move.  We fantasize together outside of work how awesome it would be to just quit together with no notice.  It gets even worse and she comes in a morning early this week and tells the operations manager she's planning on quitting at the end of the week.  He asks why and she tells him EVERYTHING.  Everything I've told you and more.  I've purposefully avoided talking about the abject sexism in this company because it's so hard to prove something like that....but I promise you it is there.  He is surprised by all of this.  He says he knew our manager was lazy but he didn't realize how bad it was for us.  He tells her that he's not going to say anything to anybody but he suggest she not quit unless she has something lined up and in the time being we should consider reporting issues to beyond our direct supervisor.

Why Minorities Work for Universities,24,1xx779,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1xx779/why_minorities_work_for_universities/,6,1392406360.0,"Disclaimer: It is the internet; I probably sound like a racist asshole. I'm not. Pinky swear.

I recently served on a hiring committee at my job to hire two new employees for our department. One new hire would be working with a Native woman that does admin stuff with one of our sub-departments, and one would be working for us at the front desk.

We had 3 leading applicants, one of whom scored quite lower than the other two. This one happens to be a Native girl. At our University there is a stroooooong unspoken correlation between favoritism and Native students. Also sports players.

Interviews are over and what a surprise our Native admin lady just adores our lowest scoring candidate, who mumbled throughout her entire interview and could not provide a single example of a workplace conflict that she had resolved in the past. Other committee members, including me, sort of nod and smile and say, ""If you think she'd be a good fit for you, then by all means...""

Final scoring comes back. 121, 117, and lowest applicant at 103. There is still talk from my supervisor about our Native admin lady taking on the lowest applicant. I (foolishly) asked how this could be possible, and why HR would approve it.

Boss replies, ""Oh, I can word it in such a way that she'll get preference over the second in line.""

I come to find, later, that because the lowest applicant is Native, and can therefore speak a language that is *sometimes* used in our Native admin's office, HR should have no problem choosing her over a much more highly-qualified candidate.

Too bad the second applicant wasn't a hockey-player.",2014-02-14 21:32:40
Tales from Transportation III: Get along little doggies,17,1xjhq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1xjhq5/tales_from_transportation_iii_get_along_little/,5,1392059619.0,"In 2007 I worked as a recruiter at a major US Trucking company.  These are the tales from that job.

It was a mild mannered Thursday morning.  Thinking about the upcoming reprieve, making plans, etc etc.  Nothing too out of the ordinary.  Then they spring a surprise fire drill on us.

Now most everyone likely has a fire escape plan at their workplace posted on some bulletin board that no one ever looks at or thinks about.  When the fire alarm started, I knew to GTFO.  I kindly hung up on the driver I was calling and filed out of the floor and down the stairs.  The rest of the floor, save for about 5 people, stayed at their computers while the loud buzzing of the fire alarm was going off.  Went down the stairs and into the parking lot, as directed.  By the time I got to the parking lot, the rest of the buildings had emptied out and people were in the lot as well, watching for fire trucks, playing on their phones, etc.  It wasn't until about 4-5 minutes later that the rest of the recruiting department came out.  

Later, as we were working away in the afternoon, a message came to all of our inboxes concerning the absolute failure of a drill.  Our security department likes to dig it in when we fail something like parking in 2 spots or a car parking in the motorcycle spaces, or some other dumb thing has happened.  They took from the cameras in the building various pictures of people standing around, people having a smoke out back, someone was texting on their phone in the stairwell, and then the coup de grace....3/4 of the recruiting floor sitting in their desks.  With timestamps....on 5 frames of camera shot......for 4 minutes......

The managers and directors of the recruiting floor were called into a meeting with Security, our vice president, and our Executive vice president.  We then proceeded to stop everything for 30 minutes so they could hand out flyers with the buildings fire plan on it and everyone could have a look at it.  Every post in the floor had a sign taped to it for Fire and Tornado emergencies.  

TL;DR If there was a real fire, I'd be one of the few left.

I said I'd post this on Saturday, but I really started losing it around the time these last few stories happen. Looking back on it all, I probably overreacted to some of it in a way that reflects poorly on me, so it's unflattering, and I'm not sure why I cared about that, but I did. Fuck it. Judge me. I'd rather have the story finished.

One day, a man who rarely worked in the office came to the office to put together a proposal of some sort. And he couldn't work a printer to save his life. He had been bent over both of our very expensive printers all day long, opening them, trying to load them, poking at their controls and swearing. As I was leaving that day, I asked what he was trying to do. He took offense and started taking his frustration out on me. Yelling. Advancing slowly in a manner meant to intimidate and invade my personal space.

And while it obviously wasn't appropriate behavior for the workplace, I saw something far worse in him. Body postures, mannerism, facial expressions, a special and very particular type of anger that I had only seen in one other person in my life. That person this man reminded me of had committed a violent crime against me. I was incredibly shaken up. I went to my boss, thinking she would understand. And to her credit, I think she did understand. I told her that I didn't want to be in close quarters with him ever again. Not even in the same room. She said I could come to her office if I ever felt threatened, but there was otherwise nothing she could do. He went to one of the managers, who went to my boss. She defended me. I didn't end up in HR's office for this one.

I knew she was right about not being able to do anything, because nothing had happened other than an inappropriately angry exchange of words to which there had been no witnesses for an HR ""investigation,"" but I lost faith. I knew without evidence what this person was capable of, and I could do nothing unless he expressed it. I couldn't just go and say I was scared. I knew that would just make *me* look like I was overreacting. But I knew. Helpless. Alone. Flashbacks. I could barely make myself go to work the next morning. I was an hour late. My boss said nothing. I wrote it off as time in lieu.

---
Unfortunately, they had hired another man who came from a culture that didn't particularly respect women. The biggest way this showed through was that if he passed a woman in our narrow hallways, she would have to move or they would collide. He would never move out of the way for a woman. I was not the only person to notice this. 

And it was petty of me, but I've always been the type to give the amount of respect I'm given. If you turn your body a little for me, I will turn mine, and we will move past each other. If you don't, I will slam my shoulder into yours. I know it was petty, but by this time I was a burned out husk full of fake smiles and false interest in everyone's home renovations and barbecues and children. Just what they wanted me to be. The only real thing left in me was this sense of respect-me-or-I-will-not-respect-you.

So one day he tried to pull this on me with a door that I opened and he moved into quickly. I continued going through it even though he was already there. He paused and let me rub my whole body against him as I passed, chuckled, and moved on. The next time I walked past his office, I remembered HR's advice that I should confront the person instead of going straight to HR, and I did so. I said what he had done by blocking the door and forcing me to rub my body against his like that made me uncomfortable, that it could be construed as sexual harassment, and if it happened again I would be going to HR.

I was in HR's office within 5 minutes. He claimed I was rude to him. That I hated him. The he didn't know what he had done to me. I recounted my side of events. HR made their petty decree to solve the problem: From now on, *both* of us were to stand aside anytime someone else wanted to move past us. Then HR turned to me to confirm our stories. So Yvenoile, if the man's version of events was accurate, the collision was an accident. If your version of events was accurate, YOU could have prevented the collision by letting him go through first. Isn't that right? My mind reeled. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The best case scenario was the lie, where there was no fault. The worst case scenario was the truth, and the truth had been dubbed my fault.

I broke. Rage. Angry tears. I said blocking a doorway in that way was textbook sexual harassment. That sexual harassment didn't have to be about attraction, that it could also be about thinking the other gender was inferior. That blaming me for wanting to go through a door was akin to blaming a rape victim for wearing a short skirt. I turned to my boss, who had been brought in as a silent third party incase anything serious went down. I said I was going to start looking for another job, keeping the promise I made months ago. I was sent home early. On my way out I asked to work from home for the next week. I got two days. Whatever.

---
In the following weeks, things have been mostly quiet. I quietly asked my few allies who knew the amazing things I was capable of if I could use them as references. They confessed in confidence that they were looking for new jobs as well. I finished my work with the cold efficiency of someone who doesn't want to leave loose ends for her successor to tie up. I am completely caught up and spend half my day reading books. I was 90% certain I wanted to leave, but my comfort zone made me delay. I was now in a place where I could do the work of two people and still have hours of free time I didn't have to confess to. I hadn't made any calls or other move to find another job, though, until two final incidents.

First: Late in the week before last, one of the employees who remembered me from the call-in center came in to do a health and safety inspection of the office. She only knew my voice and name, not my face. When I introduced myself and said I used to work in the call center, her response was a straight-faced ""oh, so you're the bitch."" Bearing in mind I hadn't spoken with her in the better part of a year. Fury. I went to my boss. ""What do you want me to do about it? Go to HR."" Right. Like I'd go to HR after their fantastic fuckups with Bully Admin and my-culture-doesn't-respect-women man. And why is it anyone else is perfectly fine bypassing HR and coming to you with any problems so you can address them with us directly, but when we need help, you won't do the same? I came back and ranted to Simple Admin about how miss HSE was welcome to have any opinion of me she liked, but I wouldn't tolerate that sort of disrespect and language directed at me. Simple Admin said I was right but tried to brush it off as miss HSE thinking she was being funny.

Second: Simple Admin, who I haven't spoken about very often, is really chatty. Even when no one's listening, she'll just talk to the computer or talk to herself or talk to the people she thinks are listening. On and on. She also has a temper. These two things combined spawns loud, endless rants polluting our shared office space. Early last week, she got frustrated because her computer couldn't read her mind, and she started slamming things around on her desk. Slam down the phone. Slap down her notebook. I HATE THIS PROGRAM! Open drawer. Slam drawer shut. THEY NEED TO MOVE US OVER TO SOME OTHER PROGRAM! Throw down her pen. Forcefully shove her keyboard away. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD IT IS. I let her go on for about a full minute, completely unable to concentrate the whole time, then turned and asked her to please quiet down a little, it's very disruptive and distracting, but if she wanted to vent in a while I could do so after this task? She stood up, huffed as she put on her jacket, and walked away to go smoke a cigarette, and in the loudest stage whisper imaginable said ""BITCH.""

Okay. So you knew, from my rant the week before, that I'm not okay with that. And you pretend to be my friend, or something like it. But now you use the same word that, three days earlier, provoked such ire.

I finally, finally gave up and started making calls the next day.

"How I started to hate my job, part 3: A huge impact on the company",42,1x9uz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1x9uz1/how_i_started_to_hate_my_job_part_3_a_huge_impact/,6,1391783830.0,"I can't really break this part down into neat little stories, because it just describes a general slow, quiet degredation of my state of mind over three months rather than a series of incidents.

Five months ago, Follower Admin quit. Our boss said that head office decreed we would not be hiring a replacement. Follower Admin had been struggling with what was reasonably two people's workload. She devoted most of her time to one half of her work, and the other half slipped. So my boss divvied up Follower Admin's workload among myself and Simple Admin. I got the difficult half that Follower Admin felt the need to devote all of her time to. I took it as a compliment. She knew I was the only one who could handle it.

But I made noise. If I'm going to be doing half of her work, do I get half of her pay as a raise? Well no, if they were going to approve raises, they would've just hired a replacement. But later she told both of us she had gotten a $2/hr raise approved. It's something. Looking back on it now, I'm pretty sure I was played from the start. Telling us we get nothing and then telling us we get $2 was like a good cop/bad cop act she did all on her own. Either way, I still wished I had the savings built up to quit on the spot for the unfairness. I told my boss as much. She nodded gravely and said she had been afraid of that. I naively thought of her as a friend, so I sighed and said I would do my best, and I would give her the courtesy of letting her know if I was going to start looking for a new job. She thanked me for both statements.

But I absolutely rocked that extra workload, and over the course of the next quarter, I revised a few processes and used my knowledge of VBA to improve speed, remove human error, and drastically improve every statistic we could track. Payroll and billing accuracy, which was already fairly high, improved by 10% to near perfect. Billing turnaround time improved by an incredible 85%. Payroll investigation turnaround time improved by 75%. And the time we needed to devote to maintain the account dropped by 65%. I was now too valuable to promote.

Meanwhile, Simple Admin fumbled her extra half of the workload magnificently, and she got it passed on to someone else. But she kept her raise. I now had more work than any of the other admins, while tied with Simple Admin for the honor of making the least money. I'm payroll, remember? I know what everyone makes.

One positive thing that came out of all this is that my boss stopped bothering me about what time I came in, knowing that while I was very slowly working my way to those amazing statistics, I was working myself to death. Literally. With all this work to do while I was learning to rock this new account that got pushed on me, I was stressing myself out to the point of no longer taking care of myself. I stopped wearing makeup, stopped wearing skirts and dresses and jewelery, stopped working out, stopped dieting. Started killing myself on caffeine and sugar to keep going. Gaining weight. Earning time in lieu hand over fist, but with no opportunity to actually use any of it.

I became hyper-sensitive to noise, which was a problem, because our three remaining admins all shared an office together. And they moved the guy who maintains the uniform room into the empty desk left behind by Follower Admin. Bully Admin constantly kept the radio on even though Simple Admin and I hated it. Add to that a phone call or two, a few employees gathered around the uniform guy's desk, someone trying to scan something on our fancy scan/email/copy center constantly making the console go beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep as they typed... and I just wanted to go into the fetal position under my desk and cry until it all stopped. I never reacted outwardly, even though I wanted to yell at them to stop. Once or twice I started to cry. No one noticed, or if they noticed they pretended not to.

And the volume of work. Five payroll runs in a row I ended up in tears. I need help, I would say. I have too much work to do, I would tell my boss. When is relief coming, I would ask HER boss. Early 2014, he would tell me. My boss would half-smile incredulously and tell me that it had been a lie, that help was not coming. I knew she was right. It was late in the year. If they intended to start someone in January, they would already be interviewing people. My boss offered to help with my workload ""when she could"" which would amount to maybe taking two hours of work off my plate per week IF she could find the time for it. Which she really tried to do at first, but it didn't last long when she realized what took two hours for me took two days for her between all her other duties. I was alone and bitter. I started lashing out at my online friends, who had been my only comfort, because it was the only place I could let go, and that was the only thing I had left to let go with.

I came down the the flu and worked from home for three days. It was the best thing ever. It was quiet. I was so much more productive. I did the unthinkable: I caught up with everything I could possibly do without being located physically in the office. I realized I needed to work from home more often, or I needed my own office. It was the only way I could get it all done. I started mentioning these things. That we needed offices. She laughed with pity. They wanted to give you desks half this size and put twice as many people in here, she said. Maybe when our lease runs out next year, they can choose a bigger office building. Our next building is going to have more shared workspaces, not more private offices, she said. What about cubicles at least? Too expensive, she said. I started bringing headphones. A hot defensive anger built up inside me every time I put them on, daring someone to tell me I couldn't have them. It hasn't happened yet.

But it was funny. While admin was under some mysterious hiring freeze, the reasoning for which had never been explained to us, HR was getting plenty of new people. Some new rules about reference checks while hiring, or some old rules that we weren't following before. So these pretty little part-time students worked for us. And they rearranged the offices so they could conduct their reference checks in complete privacy. And they got paid almost as much as I did. To make phone calls to references all day long.

But I felt valued. Somehow. Even the regional VP personally came by and shook my hand before going on holidays, saying I might not know it, but I had made a huge impact on the company. He had heard numerous people say ""Yvenoile can help you"" and mean it, knowing that I was always the best person for the job no matter what job it was. They could throw literally anything at me and I was capable of owning it. I came up with solutions. I never said ""this thing is going wrong because that person failed."" I always said ""let me look at things from their point of view, figure out what happened, and find a way to make it not happen again"" instead. I never said ""We can't do that."" I always said ""I think I can make that work, but I'll need some time."" And I was always right.

"How I started to hate my job, part 2: The promotion",34,1x6h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1x6h1b/how_i_started_to_hate_my_job_part_2_the_promotion/,8,1391695838.0,"I got promoted out of the call center and into admin after about five months in the call center. One of my coworkers had wanted the position, but she was no good at her job, could barely speak English some days let alone write it, and never made an effort to improve or learn from her mistakes. I had already gotten the position, but it had not yet been announced when one morning she spent hours on the company phone, making personal calls, not taking the calls we were supposed to take, *in a call center*. Leaving me alone to run the entire operation. Literally half the *country's* operations relying on me alone.

When I went on one of my carefully-scheduled breaks, I went to the call center manager and expressed my concerns. He pulled her in and spoke to her about how unacceptable it was, and shortly after, he announced my promotion. She hatefully called me a ""lobster,"" willing to drag anyone down to try to climb for myself, like live lobsters trying to escape the pot. I later found out that she spent weeks literally crying to anyone who would listen about how much of a mistake it was to promote me, about how bad I was at my job, about how much I'd mess everything up, about how much more deserving she was of the position. And every time she saw me in the hall, she would try to say hi with this sheepish little smile, as if she thought none of it got back to me.

Enter the admin team. A new position, much better suited to my talents. Numbers. Spreadsheets. Accuracy. Payroll. Billing. Compliance with labor laws. It was a strange arrangement, though. I was some kind of screwed up hourly/salary hybrid, with none of the benefits of either. If I needed to work extra time, I didn't get overtime pay, I got time in lieu. But I didn't get my two weeks of vacation that salaried people get, instead I had this gradually accumulating bank of 4% of my YTD earnings. My boss literally didn't understand why I couldn't take two weeks of vacation time. I said I didn't have it saved up. She said ""but we're treating you like salary. You have to take two weeks."" I walked away and took one week because that was all I had in the bank. And seriously the worst benefits. The most basic dental and para-medical coverage. That's it. No retirement plan, no savings bonds, no free gym membership that all the real salaried employees got.

The person who was quitting was training me on how to do her job, and I caught on painfully quickly. Painfully like... I would see within ten seconds that she was about to pay someone the wrong about of overtime, and it would take her 15 minutes of scribbling numbers on a notepad to figure out I was right. But she was good to talk to. She liked the same games I did. We bonded. And she warned me. The Bully Admin and the receptionist already hate you. They hate everyone from the call center, but they really hate you for getting out of it. The Follower Admin goes along with it, but I asked her to look out for you. They hate the Simple Admin too, so don't make friends with the Simple Admin or it will just be harder for you. Politics. Great.

The Exiting Admin also told me that she and my new boss were really close, and she had always been the boss's informant since the boss's office was far enough away that she never really knew the nuances of what was happening in our world. She kept up with what we were doing, but it was Exiting Admin who had informed the boss on everyone's opinions after she left the room and everyone started voicing opinions they wold never have said if they knew the boss was hearing. She told the boss I was totally fine with taking over in that role, which I was. During my training I could see some of the things she would say, and it was all things that could only help the team. But I found whenever I tried to give her information about this person being upset about this thing or that issue being way more divisive than any of them let on, she would shrug and say she couldn't do anything unless she was there to see it for herself. I stopped informing rather quickly. It was obvious we weren't going to be close.

---
One day, sure enough, Bully Admin asked a question to the entire room, not directed at anyone in particular. I answered.

First, I should explain: I have unnaturally good hearing because of a former job picking voices out of weak, staticky radio traffic.

So after I answered, she leaned over to Follower Admin and whispered ""I can't stand her."" And I heard. Across the room, I heard. I decided to give HR a chance. After all, they clearly had time for this stuff. I reported her. They ""investigated."" Bully Admin lied and said she didn't say anything. Follower Admin lied and said she hadn't heard one way or another. Thanks for looking out for me. HR called me and Bully Admin into the office, said the investigation was inconclusive and no action would be taken, then looked directly at me and said if there was a problem, I need to try talking to the person first before involving HR. Right. Excuse me Bully Admin, but I couldn't help but notice you said you couldn't stand me, and I don't think that's very professional, so please don't do it again. That's really going to get somewhere.

The receptionist and Bully Admin were always chatting and laughing until I came in the room, then they always went silent. Awkwardly. Until one or the other giggled and said they'd see the other at lunch.

---
I had adopted my predecessor's schedule. She came in early so she could leave early, 7:00-3:30. She also used to come in on the Sunday before payroll was due, so she had enough time to get everything done without the stress of the looming deadline the next day, and she would take the following Friday off in lieu. My new boss immediately nixed the Sundays until I was used to the job well enough that I didn't need to ask questions. I understood that well enough. When I felt better about them and asked if I could go back to the old schedule, she nixed the Sundays forever.

She also pulled me into her office some time later and said I needed to shift my hours so I don't leave so early. I need to stay until at least 4 in case she has questions or something last-minute that I need to do. I raised an eyebrow, thinking anything that was that urgent was going to take more than half an hour. I told her the branch I support is an hour ahead of us, and they open at 8, which is 7 our time. But she said it was the regional office I was physically located in that I needed to be concerned about, not the outlying branch I devoted literally all of my time to. I shrugged. Fine. How stupid. Her mind was obviously made up, so what was the point. My understanding was that I needed to be in the office from 8-4, which were our official office hours. And since there was a half hour unpaid lunch, there was a half hour wiggle room. 7:30-4:00. 7:45-4:15. 8:00-4:30. Whatever. As long as 8-4 was in there.

A few weeks later, my boss called me in asking why I was consistently late. ""Late"" meaning about 7:45. I wanted to tell her it was because I was beginning to hate this place. Because I couldn't will myself out of bed anymore. I had trained myself to be bright and early and you shut me down. But I told her I thought I just had to be here from 8-4. No, she said, we agreed that your hours were from 7:30-4:00. Okay. Whatever. Can I just go now. I began to think of her as a micromanager.

Now I don't. I found myself thinking back on how this happened, and I wanted to write it down, because it's really a slow downward spiral full of minor incidents that don't look problematic until you string them all together.

I started out in our call center. It's kind of like a dispatch center. I take calls from fellow employees, not customers, so we're all on the same team. It was new and interesting work, but I mostly took the job because it was work. I didn't hate it.

One day, I was having a conversation with an employee that I had a good rapport with. I mentioned that one of the other operators had been my brother-in-law. I found out later that he didn't like my brother-in-law very much. A few weeks later, the same employee had forgotten to do something important to his job, and it was my job to make sure he didn't forget again. He snapped back angrily at me. Said I was giving him a hard time for no reason. That I needed to just let him do his job. Okay buddy. Had you done your job, this wouldn't even be a discussion.

I was in HR's office by the end of the week. He had written a long letter full of lies, saying petty things like he wanted to be called by a particular nickname and I refused to use it. I was the only one in that room who even knew he preferred the name, and I used it exclusively. Pull the recordings, I said. I'm sure that won't be necessary, they said. He claimed I had only gotten my job through nepotism. My manager hired me because I was better than the only other person she had interviewed. Which was not surprising. I am smart. I learn faster than anyone she'd ever met. HR nodded. That's fine. We know this is a silly complaint. But you have to write down your version of events anyway. What events? He forgot to do this thing and I told him he had to do that thing. None of the rest of this is relevant. Pull the recordings. You'll see I wasn't out of line. You won't pull the recordings? Why not? I never got an answer to that. Just write down your story, they said. Nothing came of it.

One day, an employee who had a case of the mads about a schedule one of my coworkers had given him started taking it out on me. I kept my cool, but after the super-smiley ""okay bye now"" at the end of our conversation, I slammed the phone receiver down and slapped my notebook down on my desk a little too hard. And I started griping to my fellow coworkers, who had faced similar situations and reacted in similar ways numerous enough times that I thought it was a safe space.

I was in HR's office by that afternoon. We planned for a very strictly regulated break schedule, and they gave me a headset so I couldn't slam down a receiver. Petty. Meddling. And my coworkers, who I thought I could safely talk to, had been the ones to report me rather than show any signs of concern. Turn to me and say ""are you okay? You don't usually react like this."" No. My bad day is a disruption to them. Their smiles and how-are-yous couldn't be more false. Our rapport is a facade. I get it now.

---
One day I wrote an email in which I tried to use the word ""nag"" in a friendly, joking way. ""I'll work on getting that information, but Ben might know better than I do, so John might actually want to nag Ben for it too."" I was in HR's office that afternoon. A third party copied on the email, not John, not Ben, I don't know who other than not them, had taken offense. I sat there with my jaw set and stared at the wall, trying not to blurt out ""I quit."" Petty. So petty. I wasn't even written up for it. I hadn't been written up once yet. They just liked to take me in there and waste my time with lessons about how to function in a world where politeness, not aptitude or results, mattered. All they cared about was the facade. Joking about nagging was genuinely part of my personality, and they wanted me to kill it. Or at least turn it off while I was at work. It's not my fault Mr. Mystery assumed the worst. It's text. He could've come to me, and I could've explained. I guess that's not how we do things.

Tales from Transportation II: On-the-job training,39,1v714y,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1v714y/tales_from_transportation_ii_onthejob_training/,0,1389713237.0,"In 2007 I was a recruiter for a major US Trucking company.  These are the tales from that job.

In the first week of work, I was paired with a hot shot we'll call Tony.  Now Tony would say things that give recruiters the reputation that they have within the trucking industry (that we're all liars of the highest degree), and he claimed that ""all drivers are liars"".  He also carried around an air of ""I am better than you and I will make everyone else know it"".  He drove a BMW.  He bragged about his smoking hot fiancee.  He smelled of Stetson, overdriven to stick in your nostrils for days afterward.

Queued up some outbound calls to a section of SE NY State where we're looking for drivers for a local job for a large office supply company.  We are paying x rate per mile plus stops and hourly for city service (NYC, Boston).  Tony goes into his act (telling him we're looking for drivers, some job info) and asks the pre-requisite questions required (tickets, misdemeanors, felonies) and the driver he's talking to has a drug misdemeanor from 20 years go.  In a situation like this we are directed to go to our area director, outline the situation, and then get a yea/nay on whether to proceed with offering an orientation day and going through background checks, or just disconnecting and going onto the next one.

Tony leans in and whispers with a hint of cocky bravado ""We're going to let him slide by, this is how you get good like me"".  He tells this guy outright to ""not mention it to the scheduler or investigator"" and continue on with what the job entails, including mentioning bonuses that weren't part of the account's contracted obligations.  The driver was certainly interested in the opening as it meant he could be home more often (which was truth) and that he was getting paid twice as much (a lie).  He gets transferred through to get set up with an orientation day.  

About 2 weeks later, Tony gets his report rollout of the drivers he's gotten to orientation vs how many actually got hired.  Now, if your percentage or overall numbers are low, they'll call you in to speak with the director about it.  He had 1 hire......on 24 orientation attendees.  Our driver was not hired.  Turns out the investigators found out about his drug misdemeanor.....and B&E.....and Assault.......and the reason he didn't commit anything else since then was because 12 of those 20 years he was behind bars.  When the driver was asked to leave our orientation, he sat down and refused, claiming that as a soverign citizen he didn't have to abide by unconstitutional court rulings and that they were invalid...

Needless to say, Tony got taken down a rung after walking out of that meeting, and I learned a valuable lesson:  Stocking the cupboard is much different than throwing poop at the wall and seeing what sticks.

TL;DR Don't Lie.  It's unbecoming of a professional environment.",2014-01-14 17:27:17

Helpful and knowledgeable, but little do I know this guy is a control freak and loves to belittle the crap out of me. As if it's bad enough, I sometimes freeze up when I'm put on the spotlight and he loves doing that. Because of that he yells at me, saying how long have you been here and you cant do that? How the heck do you forget? 

I remember you idiot, its just that I freeze up because the moment I screw up, you yell at me and constantly tell me I suck at my job. What can I do when you find every mistake I make and use that to your advantage? Just today, I was looking for a folder to put some files in and I forgot where it was and what do you know the same yelling. Telling me how long have you been here and you cant remember this? Then telling me you need to figure yourself out. I never had a boss like this.

And for the finale. I swear this is the first for me. My name can be said in two different formats and it depends which region you go to. I'm not gonna say my name just in case. Anyways, I told him Ill say Name 1 because everyone would get used to it. One day I said Name 2 and thought no big deal...nope. He blew up and said ""Why did you say that? Are you dumb?

Calling truck drivers via cold call and submitted application to try and ""sell"" them on a job with us.  I worked on our dedicated job contacts, where a truck is assigned (by contractual obligation) to a customer that needs x amount of trucks all the time.  The jobs are much more regional than standard over the road trucking, have better hometime, sometimes has better pay and fringe benefits than the other jobs we have.  It's a much easier sell than telling someone they're out 2 weeks and home 4 days for x cents per mile.  

Enter the new account.  This day, all the recruiters get excited because the director has his green sheet out.  BRAND NEW ACCOUNT from a popular name brand sundry supplier at 4 different locations on the East Coast and we have to fill 160 seats.  You could smell commission in the air...so we all run back to our desks and the cold call machine is revved up to aim at one such location in North Carolina.  I get paired up with a driver, let's call him Dan.

Me: Hello Dan, this is Hiei2k7, how are you doing today?

Dan:  Well just fine.  You aren't a recruiter are you?

M:  Yes I am.  We've just had some openings in your area of North Carolina and-

D:  This isn't for over the road is it?

M:  Nope, a regional job out of Anytown, NC that operates within 300 miles of home and pays x per mile and has a few other benefits too.

We go through the whole spiel of pay, benefits, time off, etc.  Then he pipes up with this little jewel:

D:  Yea, I have a question, is there any restriction on what I can have in the cab with me?

M:  Aside from your standard ""No Alcohol, illegal drugs"" DOT stuff, we're pretty open, but no pets.

D:  So no restrictions on any personal items or toys then?

M:  (a little surprised by this question but holding firm) ....no, not to my knowledge...

He made it through orientation in Georgia and had started his job nicely.  About a week later I received an email from a fleet manager for the new account.  He had went through the house once (with the truck) and was seen later at the customer's yard with something of about 50 hot wheels cars, a rubix cube, and a 6"" dildo, pink in color as described by the yard hostler at the customer's location.  When the hostler was spotted peering into the truck, our driver Dan grabbed the dildo and threw it at the hostler, striking him in the head.  Needless to say as soon as he hit our home yard he was fired on the spot.

He was upset because he was only called once to be screened, and he had cancelled all his other appointments.

At the screening he'd told the professional that he was suffering from an eating disorder. So the hospital had been planning to treat him for this with therapy and everything.

I have a secretary who is stupid.  But she is good at dealing with the many varied temperaments of our construction workers, so I keep her around.  Plus she is willing to work for cheap.

Yesterday our mailbox got hit by a car.  I went and bought a new one, plus stickers for the street number and address.  My street name is something easily recognized when shorted.  Let's say that instead of ""Corporate Blvd"", it is usually abbreviated to Corp Blvd.  That's not the name, but it is a word that is EASILY recognized when shortened by anyone who is proficient in the English language.

So I hand the secretary the mailbox and the stickers.  I tell her to put the stickers on the mailbox in the condensed form spelling out ""1234 Corp Blvd"".  I want it to say the whole thing because our offices can be very hard to find.

Well, the stickers were too big for the mailbox, so instead of putting the entire phrase on each side, she puts ""1234"" on one side and ""Corp Blvd"" on the other.  Which, well, good job, but that doesn't exactly help people to find our offices, does it?

But that's not really enough of a story to make me post here.  The kicker was that she had written ""1234"" correctly, but the other side actually said, ""dvlb proc"".

Let that sink in.  DVLB PROC. 

Yes, she stuck those damn stickers on there backwards.

When she comes to show me her hard work, she is so proud.  I, of course, immediately notice the problem, because I am not stupid.  I also temporarily lose my powers of speech.  I look at her, look at the box.  Look at the box, look at her.

She knows there is something wrong.  She looks at the box, says, ""What, is something wrong?""  She looks intently at the letters, spelling ""Corp Blvd"" out under her breath, checking it letter by letter.

""No, nothing's wrong!  That's right! Absolutely right!""

I think for a moment, and decide that it isn't worth trying to fix stupid.  I tell her to peel the letters off and just put ""1234"" on each side.

After she accomplishes that, she comes to me and asks if she can have Monday off.  *headdesk*

Most volunteers are retired but a few still work. This is actually a story I heard from one of these volunteers.

This volunteer worked as an air traffic controller for a small ""international"" airport. It has one terminal that hosts three airlines, two runways, and flies to six cities. One of the runways has the planes going right over an older couple's house. They lived there about a year before the second runway was extended, but the other runway and the local fighter wing were there long before.

They start calling the info desk at the airport to complain about planes about 2-3 times a week and when the tower supervisor hears this, he tells the desk attendant to give them his direct line next time they call. Once they get his number they call every time a plane goes over (about 5-10 times a day) to complain. Every time they called they would yell for a few minutes and hang up, which the supervisor took every time for about a week.

However, one day he snapped. It was about the third time that day they called and he recognized their number on caller ID. He picks up the phone and they immediately launch into ""Another plane few over, when are you going to stop this, it's ruining our quality of leave, we're old, audubon society, etc."" They start complaining about the loudness of the planes when he interrupts:

""You want to hear something loud?!""

He takes the phone and slams it around in an empty metal garbage bin next to his desk and hangs up. That incident was about five years old when I heard the story and it's a year later now. In all that time they haven't heard a complaint from them since.

The Day I Called My Boss A Nazi,0,1nauv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1nauv2/the_day_i_called_my_boss_a_nazi/,0,1380354208.0,"I wanted to tell the full story, so split it in two. I feel they're separate stories, but the abrupt way the story resolves after the first part makes me not want to waste your time trying to find the other thread. So without further wasting your time, please enjoy this story which begins on the day I was described as an incompetent idiot.

So I work in print (hello, /r/TalesFromPrintAndCopy/) and we deal with plenty of the general public. As I'm sure you are aware, quality varies. So this guy writes in and asks for *five* copies of a CD. Real hey, big spender kind of stuff. He supplies the artwork just fine (small mercies) and sends through four audio tracks, which I burn to the five copies, assemble in his custom printed *five* cases and send them out as he'd paid for delivery.

Two days later, we get an email. Same guy, but now he's mad. The CD only has four tracks on it. You remember, the one's he sent? Well, the email says, the last two tracks are wrong. He sends two more files. I burn the original two tracks, drop the ""wrong"" ones and replace them with the new tracks. Send them out. He'd paid for delivery again because he was at fault.

Two days later, we get an email. Same guy, but now he's belligerent. Am I an idiot? the email asks before continuing by informing that the tracks weren't ""wrong"" but actually, what he meant by that was the CD was supposed to have six tracks. If he wasn't so brash when complaining both times, we might've let the cost of the discs slide, but for five copies and his increasingly rude attitude only points to us ""having"" to charge him for the effort. We're sorry about the inconvenience. But not really.

So anyway he refuses to pay and went on to call me specifically (an 3½ year employee) specifically stupid and our entire company incompetent. He didn't pay, his CDs were recycled after about eight weeks on non collection.

This is where I thought it ended.

But he calls up a couple months down the line. Gets my boss on the line and asks for five copies of some CD. Like any other customer, really. He says sure and agrees to do the job. When his email comes through (all artwork is sent to a central email, so we all see the same things, its a really small company) and I see it, I'm shocked. I look around and it seems like my boss is handling the job and actually printing the discs. Surprised is the least of what I am. I track down his old emails and go confront my boss.

""You're not actually doing this guys job, are you?"" I ask and the answer comes back, ""Yeah, why wouldn't I?"" which says to me that he didn't remember the guy. We get a lot of customers, so this isn't surprising. So I show the email. ""Because he didn't pay for his last job, remember? He called us all incompetent and me stupid. Then didn't even apologise when he gets in touch again?"" - I could see that he was conflicted by this as he'd already agreed to do the job, but had a pretty good reason not to. For some unknown reason these words passed his lips: ""Sometimes you just have to be kind.""

Be kind? Be kind‽ to who? some nobody doing five discs who openly insults your staff, doesn't pay for his job is rude and is only putting through *eighteen dollars* worth of sale? I went to another part of the office and paced around while I let out bursts of muffled curses like a steam engine. Surely, *surely*, I'm worth more than that? You'd sell me out for eighteen dollars - MINUS expenses? I was livid. You could have lit cigarettes off my skin. I didn't know what to say, so I shut the fuck up and avoided him for the rest of the day and most of the next day and the day after that. Eventually I told myself he'd been stuck because he agreed to do the job. That had to be it. It was nothing personal, just forgetful and whatever. The time had passed.

Then a few weeks later, he writes back in again. ""Can I have five copies of this please?"" - My co-worker and I both agreed to ignore the email with extreme prejudice. A week later, he calls asking about the whereabouts of his discs. My co-worker fields the call and puts him on hold. Checks with the boss. ""Should we do this guys job? I mean, to remember him, right?"" - the next thing I hear is about 20 minutes later. We're doing the job.

Wow.

Just wow, but I hold my tongue. I'm livid, but I keep my cool. I'm restrained. Obviously, there's nothing I can do. It is what it is and I've just got to learn that sometimes the working man gets treated like this. It's just my turn and I'm glad it's not worse. But still, I feel betrayed. Like, and apologies about the cheap metaphor, but like a knife had been plunged into my chest. How could he? How could he do this guys job? How could he treat me like this? But whatever. Let it slide. Boss apparently changed from the cool, kinda hip boss I started working for into someone who'd rather make eighteen bucks (minus expenses) than to stick up for a three+ year employee. Whatever.

So anyway, a few days later and I'm calling my boss a Nazi.

On this day, my co-worker and I (we share adjoining cubicles with low walls between them, so we can talk while doing the bulk of our work) were packing a new type of case. For whatever reason, they didn't have a dedicated spine (like a DVD case has, for example) but just the hinge part where the front and back join. We had to insert slicks into these cases. The slicks had printed spines which were hard to line up. We'd never packed this kind of case before and it was tough. Half a mm in either direction and it looked off. Presentation matters, so we were making sure it was correct. Just chatting to pass the time.

Boss walks past and his words, I feel, will be etched into me for years to come. ""Hey guys, how about less chatting and more packing?"" Stunned once again, I fire back, ""You know we're packing at the same time, right? We can do that."" he returns, ""Yeah, but you're going so slow."" and retreats back to his office. Snidely I suggest to my co-worker that the Boss should try ""More sucking on *this* and less telling us how to do our jobs.""

We got the job done one day and three hours before it was due for completion.

In an industry like ours, we have busy periods and quiet periods. The afternoon following that particular job was quiet, which meant two things. One: We had plenty of time to pack that job. And two: I had plenty of time to think about what he'd said earlier.

So when I'm leaving for the evening, I pop my head in to his office to say good night, as I've always done. In the end I decide to speak up. ""You know, it might be one thing to do a job for a client who openly insults your staff (he seemed puzzled by this, then did what I feel was a mock imitation of remembering *oh yeah, him*) but its another to tell your staff they can't talk to eachother. That's ridiculous."" He explains his rationale by repeating what he said before, that we were packing too slow (I countered with the facts of the matter: That it was complete well ahead of schedule and ""going so slow really interfered with the rest of the jobs we had to do today, didn't it?"") and that we talk *too much*, so much that it sounds like an old wive's club over where we sit. I asked him if that mattered as long as we did our jobs and that I'd been in the same position with two other employees over the last three and a half years of my employment and was never under the impression that talking wasn't allowed. He seemed not to care and so the last thing I said before walking out was ""People are people and need to talk. You can't stop people from doing it. That's Nazi shit.""

And because I am petty, I spent the entirety of the next day answering any questions via a notepad I'd bought. I wrote everything down and except for walk-ins and telephone calls, I was completely silent.

And you know what? I really didn't notice and dramatic improvement in my ability to do my job (specifically speed-wise) when I wasn't using my mouth to do it with.

So that's my story. The End.",2013-09-28 10:43:28
First Time Fired: A Manifesto,37,1n6p8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1n6p8e/first_time_fired_a_manifesto/,8,1380213495.0,"So today, it happened. I got 'let go' from a job that I truly thought was going to open the door to the rest of my life. I feel terrible, but at the same time, I feel so relieved.

Truth is, it wasn't a good fit. I had no connection with my middle-aged office-mates. I wanted to like sitting at Quickbooks all day, sending out invoices for loans. I tried to get something better out of it, but being a non-profit, it wasn't like I could pick up hours or really delve into my own projects and interests. I think the organization is great- if I could've essentially gotten a creative role or anything where I could feel myself learning or being of actual use. There was no chance to move up, and even when I started, I knew I didn't have the patience to stay there long. 

The job kind of fell into my lap after a meeting about volunteering. Even though I had no real experience or interest in clerical work (I've got a background in marketing, social media, and entrepreneurship), I was so enamored by my name being attached to the kind of organization I spent 4 years and $100,000 to be a part of, I didn't think twice.

The worst thing about it is I don't know what to do next. It was only PT (I still work FT as a server) so the money part isn't a real issue. There's just so few similar organizations around or even other gateway positions that I can get involved with. 

I'll take an internship, I'll volunteer. Both would end up being more rewarding, I think. There's slim-pickings where I'm from and I'm not in the position to move anytime soon.

On the bright side, I haven't had a day off since I started in June. I get to spend a few whole days with myself. I need a haircut, to clean the house, call my parents and catch up on BrBa. No more 70-hour weeks, no more lonely days in a quiet office. 

I wish the organization well and thank them for the opportunity- the opportunity to remind me that I'm NOT the silent, sitting-at-desk, getting-headaches-from Quickbooks type. I need to talk to people and make connections and see growth and feel like a useful cog. I'm not a scapegoat, I'm not uneducated, I'm not shy, and I'm not afraid.

However, within 45 minutes after the original email was sent, a coworker (let's call him A for ASS) who worked on the project with me sent a mass reply that he wanted to present that project. I was slightly annoyed, but whatever, there are other things I can talk about.

Fast forward to last week. A's wife is expecting their first born middle of next month (October). He asked me if I can help him with the presentation. The conference is next week. I asked him, how much help did he need? He said, he does not have a first draft yet. WTF? So, not only he stole the presentation from me, now he wants me to write it for him? I asked him, wasn't he the one that wanted this 6 months ago? Then he proceeded to say, well... I didn't know back then that my wife would be having a baby. I looked back into my chat records with him (yay... Gtalk record!) and he announced about the baby back in February, 1 month before the abstract submittal. So he could have just NOT submitted any abstract or even better, hand it off to me 6 bloody months ago! I told him, at least give me his abstract or a first draft so I know what he's planning to talk about. Then I said, I'm only doing this for his wife, not for him. A said, he'll think about it and let me know if he needs my help.

Then, Monday (1 week before the conference), A asked my other coworker (let's call her B) to present the talk (yes, the project that I was a PM for) and write the entire presentation. He told her he's not able to present at the conference because of the baby is coming any time (by the way, same state, but about 1 hour flight, he could easily take a morning flight there, and evening flight back). He asked B to write the presentation and present it as him. B has no idea how to write a presentation on a project that she was never involved in, and she has to do it in less than one week. She came to me with the news and almost begged me to go instead of her. I looked her in the eyes, and told her that I would only do it for her, but I am PISSED as fuck with A. Who the fuck does shit like that? Then, she saw how pissed I was, and told me, no, it's okay, she'll do it. She's a trooper like that.

So... let's recap...
1. He, who has a PhD in engineering, happens to forget that pregnancy takes 9 months, meaning that your baby WILL come in October
2. He said he was not expecting his wife to be pregnant in October. Is he telling me that the baby was NOT planned? So, his first born son was an accident?
3. Does expecting a baby also prevent him from writing the presentation on top of the not going to the conference? Or was he planning on making other people writing it all along?

Now, I'm having problem with my conscience because I don't want this to ruin my relationship with B (practically the nicest person in the company), even though I had nothing to do with causing her the problem. I have a public speaking difficulties that when I'm presenting at a conference, I would have to finish the presentation weeks before, and practice the talk over and over again before the day of. Had I known I'd be presenting this project 6 months ago, I would have started at least 1 month before the presentation. On top of that, we're super crazy busy at work that the only time I'll have time to work on the presentation would be at home on my own time. I really do NOT want to go at all. I may have to for her. 

TLDR: 6 months ago, asshole coworker claimed my project as his own to present at a conference happening next week, and now asked another coworker to write and present for him 1 week before the conference",2013-09-25 20:06:17

The shop boss (a scatterbrained and somewhat spineless guy) thought that I was going to be the new boss until we figured out that he outranked me by ""time in grade"" - we were the same rank, but he held his rank a year earlier than did I.  So he was the boss.

He was also going through a very messy divorce.  He caught his wife cheating on him and was heartbroken and bewildered, but his civilian wife had become extremely vicious and was trying to get him in trouble.  Her boyfriend was a military cop (MP), and she tried using that against my boss until the military caught on and put a stop to it.

So I had only been there for a couple of days, and was alone in the shop doing paperwork when the shop phone rang.

""Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant Calladus, this line may be unsecured, how can I help you?""

""Oh, you're the new NCOIC (shop boss for the civilian folks).  Jim (Staff Sergeant Bewildered) told me you are going to be in charge!  I need you to make him do something for me.""

""Sorry, no, Staff Sergeant Bewildered is still the shop boss.  He outranks...""

""No, he doesn't.  Why are you covering for him?""

""We just figured it out yesterday ma'am, he out..""

""NO!  YOU are his boss,"" she yelled.  ""And YOU need to tell him to let me the fuck into our house!""

""I'm sorry ma'am, but he's my boss, and I won't get involved in his private life.""

""You're an asshole and you're lying for ..."" CLICK.

I'd hung up the phone.

The phone rang.

""Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant Calladus, this line may be unsecured, how...""

""YOU ASSHOLE, WHY THE FUCK..""  CLICK

I hung up the phone again.

The phone rang.

""Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant... ""

**""GOD DAMMIT YOU FUCK...""**  CLICK.

I had hung up the phone again.

There was a noticeable pause.

The phone rang.

""Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant Calladus, this line may be unsecured, how can I help you?""

Her very quiet, and somewhat contrite voice said, ""Why do you keep hanging up on me?""

""Ma'am this is a military phone line for military business.  I'm not required to listen to an abusive civilian who has nothing to do with my job.  So any cursing will immediately end this phone call.  Speaking to me is your privilege, not your right.""

She started to say something, but I just bulldozed over her.

Ma'am, I don't know you and you don't know me, but you've accused me of being a liar to protect your husband from you.  Frankly, I don't care one way or the other.  What is true is that he DOES outrank me by a year in grade, and will remain the shop boss unless something changes.""

""You are not in my chain of command, ma'am, so even if I did outrank your husband, I would not order him to do anything for you because that would be unlawful and unethical.""

""I don't give a damn about what is going on between the two of you, and since I'm not anyone's friend here I won't lift a finger to help either of you solve your personal problems.  As long as his personal life doesn't get in the way of his Air Force duties, or break the laws of the UCMJ, then **I. Just. Don't. Care.**""

""Now get off my phone.  I have work to do.""

I got the job fresh out of the Air Force, and even though I started as a technician, within the first six months I had won Employee of the Month and had been promoted to ""associate manufacturing engineer"".

It was a great company, I loved working there and I really respected and enjoyed working with my coworkers and my bosses.  

But there was this one guy...

I worked as a non-degreed engineer trainee, and they needed someone with experience and training to design automated test systems.  I was doing that with embedded processors and with ATE systems, but the company wanted an ""ultimate tester"", and hired an engineer.  He was personable, easy to get along with, and extremely intelligent.  He knew his shit.

He was also pretty damned lazy.

I worked at this company for 9 months - total.  During the time I worked there we were sold on three different occasions.  The first two times we were sold, I hardly noticed.  Life went on as normal.  The third time we were sold, all of management came out wearing their best suits to tell us that nothing would change.  

Some of these people I had never seen wearing a suit before.  So naturally I polished up my resume, and sent out 50 copies a week and starting going to interviews.

During this time, we had been having problems with our engineer.  Parts were missing, project dates were missed.  He fell asleep at his desk.  It got pretty bad.  My boss, (also this guy's manager) talked to me and we both admitted this guy was a mistake to work with.  

The company started letting him go, but somehow he got in good with the plant manager, who overruled my manager and kept him on.

Some of the automatic test equipment we used had the ability to use passwords and multiple accounts.  There were administration privileges.  Someone once locked themselves out, and my boss and I figured out how to trick the system into unlocking itself.  

So I left that company just as it was starting to reduce it's workforce in preparation of having the company gutted and the pieces scattered around the country.  I let everyone know that I had a new job lined up, and where I would be living and working.

I ended up at a new manufacturing company.  And a month after I got there, I got a call at my desk from my old plant manager asking me for the passwords to several test systems.  I gave him the passwords I used to use, but they did not work.

I then told him that my old boss knew how to break in and get around the passwords.  But I was informed that he had quit after a dispute with the plant manager over the lazy engineer.  (I later found out that he found a job on the East Coast at a nice pay raise.  Good for him!)

I then mentioned that perhaps the lazy engineer had those passwords.

Long sigh from the plant manager - lazy engineer was fired, but out of the goodness of his heart, and for a large consultant fee, lazy engineer could probably figure out how to ""break in"".  Of course lazy engineer had no clue what the passwords were to these systems... 

I have no idea what happened after that call, but I think lazy engineer had figured a way to get another paycheck out of that company.

TL;DR: Of course I don't know the passwords to your system, but maybe if you pay me, I can hack it.",2013-07-01 22:55:34

For record she has the alert on her account since we didn't charge that card. There wasn't enough on the card to take the money so therefore cannot receive service from us anymore until debt is paid and if it's not we send it to collections and they are banned from our services.

Like everyone else, I ended up working there only because I hadn't planned ahead better and this place would hire pretty much anyone (though there were a few people there who I'd call True Believers who thought they were singlehandedly saving the world by doing this job).  

The job was from 4ish to 9ish we'd go door to door and ask for donations.  We'd also sign people upfor our mailing list.  You had to bring in a minimum of $500/week to get paid $300/week.  Anything over that you got 35% of, anything under that and you'd only get 35% of it (so if you brought in $400, you get paid $140).  For most of us this meant that once you hit $500 for the week (which you could on Thursday or Wednesday) you could slack off and goof around.

It wasn't awful as far as summer jobs went as long as you didn't mind the weather or harassing strangers all day everyday.  Usually you'd knock on 70-100 doors and maybe get 10ish people to donate.  I saw some weird shit there because, of course, you were just knocking on random peoples doors interrupting what they were doing.  I had some of the expected stuff - getting sworn at, cursed out, offered food drinks and illegal substances, but a few stories stick out.

-I had a guy talk to me from behind the door with his head sticking through the crack.  He didn't want to donate so I offered him a pamphlet.  He told me to leave it on the step because he ""forgot to bring clothes to the door"".  Had another lady talk to me through the front window because she wasn't wearing pants cause she couldn't afford to run the AC.  She ended up donating.

-One lady invited me in and pointed me to her living room.  We weren't supposed to go into people's houses, but everyone did cause it was hot.  I fixed her cable box before she realized I wasn't the cable guy.  She gave me $50 (because she could cancel her service call).

- Some guy walking his cat saw me talking to his neighbor and afterward insisted I follow him home (was only a few houses down).  He asked me all sorts of questions for over an hour (normally, even if someone donated it was under 10 minutes).  I covered literally everything in our pamphlets three times and out of nowhere he's just like ""Ok I'll get my checkbook"" and writes a check for $70.  Still no idea what I said.

-Had a coworker leave because she was saw in a psychic vision that we would all be flooded in  storm - she moved to Florida and after that would send us postcards addressed from her cats.

-A lady found out that I was going to the same college as her daughter in the fall and gave me her daughters number and then took down mine.  She actually was pretty cool and we hung out some in college.

-Acting out our spiel for the numerous people who didn't speak English.  Yeah you try charades-ing ""climate change' and ""sea level rise"".

-All time favorite:  Knocked on some guy's door and he comes out and invites me to sit on his enclosed porch.  We're talking a bit and I notice he has an accent and it turns out he lived in some British colony and actually fought in some sort of colonial conflict in the 60s or something.  It takes me a minute but I realize the whole conversation he keeps gesturing with his pistol and waving it around, generally in my direction.  I point out a couple times that it's making me uncomfortable.  He keeps waving it around, so I start getting up to go.  He gets in my way and is looking at me and asks me if I'm nervous.  I reply that no, I just need to be moving along or I get in trouble.  At this point, he points it at me and tells me to sit back down.  I'm thinking in my head ""SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT"".  The guy pulls the trigger and it squirts me in the face.  With water.  He starts rolling on the ground laughing his ass off as I just sit there in shock.  He ends up cutting a check for $200 something and apologizes profusely.  On the paperwork we do for donations, there's a little spot for notes (for when they go back to the area next summer), so I write ""may try to scare you with realistic water gun"".  My boss asks me about it, and I retell the story, at which point he looks horrified.  So, he took me out for ice cream and put it in the computer with a big note that this guy was nuts and someone from central can call him and not to send people back to his house.

The second is that our dementia patients usually keep to  their rooms, so even the ones who are residents should know better. And finally, my procedure should be fool proof.

The doors lock from the inside, so first I push slightly to see if they're unlocked. Then I knock, waiting to see if I get a response from someone who just forgot to lock it. Then I open the door very slowly.

If someone is inside, they have plenty of time to shout ""someone's in here!""

Harvest the data from the data set, prepare phone numbers and addresses, feed the phone numbers to the sharks, and prepare the bulk mail batch, which we did daily.

Did I mention the drugs?

Well, one fine day, the owner of the company decides, while he is in jail on drug charges (yep), that he's going to revisit all of those old lien adverts.  He wants them to go out in one shot.  

I look at the data set. We have about 25,000 of these records that are not identical.  My equipment: about three pallets of pre-printed advertising fliers, which I run through a HP LaserJet 5SI on a daily basis, no matter how many I have.  We also had a stuffer-sealer machine that we used for this - a lower-end Pitney Bowes machine.

He wanted them out on a daily basis.  Made no sense to me - that, and he refused to understand that the stuff that got sorted at the main PDC in Vernon, California would spend three weeks waiting to be fed into the system and delivered, rather than getting sorted at the more local PDCs and arriving a day or two after departure - and save him money in the process.

Did I mention the drugs?

So we got to work.  We rented two more HP 5SI printers, got the toner we needed, ordered more supplies, and I got to work.  I spent three weeks running everything through the SS machine after we spent three days printing the batch in several separate jobs, in a concerted effort to make sure that we didn't crash the workstation I was working with.  Meanwhile, the daily batches must be run and transported to the Anaheim P&DC, which covers north Orange County.

Did I mention the drugs?  They helped him work faster. How he maintained this in the slam, I don't even.

So we finally finish, I get back to my normal routine, and these things sat.

And sat.

They blocked the coffee maker, so we moved the coffee maker.

They blocked the time clock, so we moved the time clock.

They gathered dust for another month.  

Because he would not approve the postage.

The postage bill for this entire load ran about $5,000.  

Did I mention the drugs?  They sometimes came from the postage budget.  We had a nominal budget of around $1,000 per month for the postage meter, as we required this to send out monthly invoices and correspondence. 

We finally got it out.  We took three cars, including the small pickup that one of the employees drove, and delivered the whole kit and caboodle to the US Postal Service, with an enormous check for the postage required, plus a little extra for future runs.  

They delivered.

This marketing campaign, ultimately, didn't really fail.  It helped a bit, but at the end of the day, the company folded.

Did I mention the drugs?  Part of the payroll budget was required for that.

Yeah.

This happened around a decade ago.  I now do technical support, until I get a gig in IT somewhere.

To note, I have a labor commissioner judgement against him, set in 2005, for $4,000 as base principle; this is set for the owner and the now-dead company, jointly and severally (which means I can collect from either one).  In California, promising to pay vacation to somebody, and then failing to do so when they request it, constitutes shorting somebody's paycheck - and if you are short so much as a dime on somebody's paycheck, that constitutes late payout of payroll.  The penalty for that is one day's typical pay per day it is late, for up to thirty days.  As California applies a 10% APR on a judgement, he now owes me much more.  I don't expect that I will ever get that from him, however, even if I enforce collections against him.

Did I mention the drugs?

Once upon a time, I worked for a major pharmaceuticals distribution company, in their customer accounting department.  Didn't pay much, but it did OK.  The vending machine chow was at least half way decent.

At least, when the cleaning crew didn't unplug the sandwich machine.  Say what you will about Cafe Carousel, those burritos were pretty damn good.  I can't remember the brand, but if you're in the Los Angeles area, they are (or were) pretty common - mostly known for being paper wrapped and having other flavors like ""Chile Relleno"".  I think they were called Maria's.  they don't exist here in Seattle.

Anyway. 

One fine day, we had a change in cleaning contractors.  Shortly after this, I'm coming in for work, I get my buck and a quarter and go to buy such a burrito.  But, guess what is being emptied.

The machine.  The man from Canteen (a vending machine company) was clearing it out, because somebody had unplugged it over the weekend.  This would not be remedied until the next day.

So come around the next day, he's back, restocking.  Since he's there, I hand him cash, he hands me a burrito.  Boom, done.

Week after week after maddening week, this happens.  

...and then I come in on a Saturday to grab a personal item (a CD) from my desk.  Take a guess as to what is plugged in and who's at work.  

Yeah.

I wait around a few minutes, and then once they are done, I plug the machine back in.  It kicks on.  Nobody was the wiser, and the machine was only unplugged for a few minutes, so no biggie.

Monday comes 'round.  I get my burrito, go to work, don't get sick. In the process, I fire up WordPerfect, and make a sign:  ""Please do not unplug/No Disconectar, por favor""

(Our cleaning staff was Spanish speaking.  Yes, in English, too - there should be no question.)

The problem never happened again.

I continued, however, to be amused by the fact that the old cleaning system always designated the big box of coffee cups for the ""19th Floor Brake Room"". =D

Dr 2: Of course I can, it's not metal, you're on.

Background: I work as a gym cleaner, and I only work the weekends. I only heard about this through co-workers, as the subject of this story works only during the week on the front desk. I'll refer to her as M. 

Story: M is an older woman who works the front desk early in the mornings on the weekdays. I've only had the ""pleasure"" of working with her twice, and I've avoided the brunt of her rude behavior (side note: when I worked with her, the worst she did was persuade me from taking a break when I felt exhausted and then taking the food that a friend brought in for me). My coworkers have seen her at her worst.

She spends her time complaining about the other cleaners, ignoring the members' complaints, and generally being a bitch. Recently, the workers for the front desk have to ""compete"" in a contest to get members to sign up for the fitness training program and M decided to cheat by signing up members whether they wanted to or not. The straw that broke the Boss's back was that she spent a good portion of her shift complaining about how the cooler was running low of water. She then refused to stock it herself, as well as bitch about how there was no water in the closet. Boss flips and rips her a new one, telling her to do her job and stop complaining,

As far as I know, her bitchiness toned down a lot after that. ",2013-03-17 04:30:58

Pretty much without fail, if something was going to go wrong, it went wrong at 4:15.

So one day, I'm working the front desk with my buddy Will.  Around 3 p.m. this member comes in.  He was this tall, slim guy in his early 40s who came in fairly regularly although never on a normal schedule like most of our members.  He was kinda weird and unpredictable.  Sometimes he was very talkative, usually annoyingly so, and other days he kept quiet and to himself.  I never actually saw him working out, which made me kind of nervous but my other coworkers saw him much more frequently and said he was weird but never did anything out of line.

Anyway, he must have been off his meds that day because he seemed really agitated and kept going in and out of the gym.  He'd be inside for maybe 15 minutes then leave to smoke a cigarette then come back for another 15 minutes then leave.  The security guard said he would routinely see the guy talking to himself on the street and swinging around light poles.  I knew from his behavior this day something wasn't right.  At 4 p.m. we closed the pool as usual and around 4:15 we did a sweep to get people off the execrise floors.  Meanwhile this guy is still going in and out with increase frequency.  Finally he comes in around 4:20 and goes into the locker room.  He's the only person left.  By 4:35 he's still not out and we've basically shut down the whole place, cleaned up, and prepped for the next day.  Will and I probably could have taken the guy but were uneasy about forcing him out because he was so bizarre and we were scrawny teenagers.

Finally around 4:40 as we're getting ready to go get him, the security guard comes around to the desk and says ""I saw your boy back there in the shower.  He was jerking off.  I told him he couldn't do that here and he had to get out.""

Maybe 5 minutes later he comes out and gives us this weird face.  I can't say it was a threatening face but the gesture was clearly an obscure ""fuck you"" as he left.",2013-03-12 23:32:54

A shitty 3rd person story for you all....,36,19emt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/19emt2/a_shitty_3rd_person_story_for_you_all/,7,1362072971.0,"Since I don't work Retail (and neither did he) I figured this post of a story from my husband fit more here.

One day my husband is at his job (Business Analyst) and he needs to go use the restroom. I'm not familiar with the mens room at his work, so I'll paint the picture from what I know.

It has 2-3 stalls and a few urinals. Not a big place, it's more of a satellite office. 

My husband has to use the toilet, and he enters what can only be described as the depths of hell. Surely no one, ever should be exposed to the complete horror of what lay in that stall. However just like the car wreck that you cannot look away from, this was just as difficult for the mind and nose to process. Apparently, one of the male co-workers had a slight emergency. He made it to the restroom, closed and (I would guess) locked the stall, pulled down his pants, and thats when the battle against the shitsplosion was lost.

It was a scene from a 3rd rate horror movie in the stall. While this persons ass was at least aimed in the correct direction, that was as good as it got. Shit was literally splattered all over the two side walls, and the back wall of the stall. It continued on in a dripping horrid mess down to the flusher, which was covered in what can only be decribed as ""liquid brown stank"" and was also splattered all over the seat and floor.

The aim must have been unusual (according to my husband) because the shit on the back wall of the stall was waist high. So not only was this persons asshole aimed backwards, but upward as well.

My husband was very thankful that he was not the cleaning person at his job that day.

Last straw: Written up for following manager's orders - twice!,72,196j1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/196j1v/last_straw_written_up_for_following_managers/,16,1361776020.0,"Years ago I worked as a ""Database Specialist"", which is a fancy title for someone who does simple data entry, for a brand new company whose product was internet based.  

When I say ""brand new"", I mean that when I was hired (first employee in my department, after the Mgr and Asst mgr), the company had just moved into their new office *from the owner/president's basement*.  Brand spanking new.

My job was simple.  Companies from all over the US would fax us their information (that changed daily) every day.  The fax would show up on the Mgr's computer, she would distribute the faxes to the Asst mgr and me, and keep some for herself.  We would enter the information into our database, which could then be searched by any of our subscribers on our website.  

Fast forward two years.  The company and, hence, my department, have grown so much that we have had to move to a larger office space.  There are now 8 other people doing the same job I am, 7 of whom I have trained.  (I have, in fact, written the training manual.)

I love my job, and I am an excellent employee (if I do say so myself).  Of the 200 or so faxes that we get in every day, I enter over 100 of them, including all of the ""difficult"" ones.  I do this in the same amount of time that it takes my 8 other team members *and* the 2 managers to do the other 100 or so.  But, far from minding, I love doing it.  

Until.

Apparently, Asst Mgr got it into his head that he should rightfully be Mgr, and sets out to accomplish this goal.  The way he goes about it is to write programs for the computer, which he somehow thinks will get him promoted into Mgr's job (don't ask me how, as Mgr *built* the database, has been with the company since it was in the basement, and is personal friends with the owner/president).  In order to have the time to do this, he starts handing me most of his work.  I don't mind, I think its fun, so I add it to my workload without complaint.

Mgr sees this as a threat to her position (again, don't ask me why), so she calls me into her office for a ""chat"".  I am informed that the work Asst Mgr has been giving me is ""above my pay grade"", and that I'm not allowed to do it anymore.  I agree that I will not, but explain that it has been given to me *by my boss*.  She says she will handle him.

Less than an hour later, Asst Mgr gives me some of his work to do.  I tell him that I have been told by Mgr that I can't do it anymore.  He gets irate, and starts yelling at me (in front of the whole department) and telling me ""I am your boss and I'm telling you to do it!""  I again explain that I can't.

So he *writes me up* for insubordination!  Naturally, I go to Mgr and explain what happened.  She says she'll take care of it.

Next day, repeat.  Another good screaming at, another write up.  I go to Mgr again.  Same story, she'll ""take care of it"".  Somehow, I don't believe her.

So I go to the owner/president (who I know, since its a small company, and he's always very friendly and chatty around the office and keeps telling us at company meetings that he has an open door policy).  I explain what's been happening.  

He gets a ""deer in the headlights"" look, and starts stammering.  The gist of the stammering was, basically, ""what do you want *me* to do about it?""  

So I thank him, go straight to Accounting (we didn't have an HR department), grab a blank piece of paper and write ""I quit"".  I sign and date it, and go home, never to return.

Because, **fuck that**! ( Also because I was barely 23.)

I've returned with more stories from my time working as a security guard at a theme park we will call *Five Penants*.

As I stated in my last story, this was the worst job I've ever had. It was only for one season, and it still aged me at least 10 years.  I have two tales today.  **Camp American Idiots** and **Bigots. Bigots Everywhere**

*Camp American Idiots*

I knew from the start that today would be rough.  It was already 85 degrees at 8am, and weather projections said it would reach around 100 degrees by 11.  To top it off, I was working a double.  9am till closing, usually around midnight.  My only hope was that I was on a patrol, and not assigned to a ride for both of these shifts.

But like a man who pulls down the panties of that thai hooker he suspects *may* just be a man, my worst fears were soon confirmed...

I arrive at work, sign out my radios and equipment, and look at the assignment board.  Ahhh fucksticks...  There in bright red erasable marker is my name.  And next to it my assignment.  The most popular ride in the park *AwesomeDude: Guy of Iron* (Think super hero with red tights and giant letter on his chest).  I was assigned that ride for both shifts.  I wanted to punch a baby out of anger right then and there.  This was the most popular ride in the park, prone to a  lot of problems.  It had also been voted best coaster in the world several years running. It was EXTREMELY popular. Average wait time was over 3 hours. That meant dealing with a ton of people wanting to leave for the rest room.  It was fine to leave but we weren't allowed to let people go back to their spot in line. Once they left the line, they left their spot.  It was awful.  I had a single life guard chair to sit and watch. Or I could wander around and keep an eye on the lockers. I was not looking forward to dealing with line cutters, smokers complaining they couldn't light up, and fat people causing a scene when  they wait for 3 hours and then cant fit on the ride.  That happens WAY more than you think.

Cut to 5pm.  The mid day heat is just starting to fade, but its still blistering hot out.  The sweat stains on everybody's clothes are like a moving, complaining, Rorschach test.  All I see when I look into those shapeless patterns is myself, pulling my hair out, screaming ""WTF AM I DOING HERE!""  It's hot, it's miserable, and just an awful day.

Oh I missed a part. Today we had special guests at the park. Camp America, if I recall.  It was a camp set up for kids who lost parents during 9/11.  They were obvious with their bright red shirts.  They weren't the only ones in the park that day, but you couldn't go far without seeing at least a few of them.  

Anyways, it's late in the day, I've been dealing with bullshit since I first started my shift.  A while ago I had seen a group of kids from Camp America enter into the line.  Now, a few hours later, they are near the stairs leading up onto the ride platform. I see one of them on the phone.  A minute or two later, I see two other in Camp American shirts pushing their way through the crowd.  These two though, are counselors.  I see them walk over to the group of 4 younger kids, and begin climbing the stairs with them.

So I walk over to them. They are next in line to get on the ride at this point.  The operators of the ride see me and keep the car in the station.  I approach one of the counselors and calmly explain that they can't ride the ride. Only the kids can.  This counselor, Blake (Because he looked like a Blake.  Just imagine  any 80's movie bad guy named Blake. Now throw him in modern clothes. Nailed it), didn't like this.

Blake: Why can't we ride the ride?

Me: You can. Long as you go to the end of the line and wait like everyone else.

Blake: But we're counselors. These are our kids.

Me: Yea....

Blake: So we have to stay with them.

Me: So where were you the last 3 hours while they were waiting in line?

Blake: We were with them.

Me: No. I was here the whole time. My job is nothing but sitting and watching. It's awful, but easy. I've been watching them since they walked in because I thought it was weird that they didn't have any counselors with them.  But they were well behaved so I figured you guys just allowed them off on their own.  Now I guess you just wanted them to wait in line while you used other kids to skip the line for other rides. (Note: We had been getting complaints all day about this from other park patrons.)

Blake: How dare you. This is Camp America man. This for kids who lost parents. IN 9/11!  

Me: And did you lose anyone in 9/11?

Blake:  No...

Me: Ok then.  So here's the deal.  You're holding everyone up.  You cut hundreds of people who have waiting hours for this ride. You left your kids, who you're in charge of, alone for several hours. And you used them to ride the rides without having to wait. So, if you want to ride it, go to the end of the line.

Blake: We have to ride with the kids.

Me: Ok tell you what. Why don't you go and ask everyone in line if it's ok with them. If they all say yes, I'll let you ride with them.  Tell them it's for 9/11. They'll understand I'm sure.  

At this point Blake is staring at me. People in line are chuckling.  One large man, who was behind the kids in line simply says ""Don't even bother. End of the line asshole"", which got  a good laugh from the crowd. Blake and the other counselor just told the kids they'd wait for them at the exit of the ride and walked back through the line. The kids got on the ride, and the car began its ascent up the lift hill.  As I was about to walk away, the same guy who had just told Blake to pack it in, waves me over.  He is with 4 people, and says he wants to give up his spot on the next car for the Camp kids.  ""They already went through enough.  It's unfair they have to lose a parent and be stuck with dickholes like that. We can go after their second ride.""

Dude's an American hero.  So the ride comes back into station, I tell the kids someone has offered to let them go again if they wish. They all cheered and took another turn riding.  


And now for the dark side of humanity: *Bigots. Bigots Everywhere*

*Warning: Graphic, hateful Language*

So at our park, we would host groups on occasion.  They were offered first sale of tickets for a day of their choosing. If they could sell X amount of tickets, the park was theirs for the day. If they couldn't, they would get first entry into the park, and then the park would open and hour later for regular guest.  They would be told their is a group function before they purchased their tickets.  It's also a little bullshit because season ticket holders would only be allowed entry if they purchased a ticket for the day.  

I walked into work, and saw a huddle of my co workers.  Wails of lament could be heard from yards away.  ""Man, if I had known, I would have called out.""  ""Fucking hate this day""

I ask whats wrong, and I'm told that it is ""Gay Day"".  Apparently once a year a local LGBTQ magazine rents out the park. It isn't advertised ahead of time because it draws protesters.  My boss gathered us round and explained whats up.  He had some simple rules for us to follow. 

1.) Treat everyone with respect. Doesn't matter our beliefs, you will be fired and held accountable if you do something stupid

2.) Don't call anyone sir or ma'm or miss today. Just to be safe and avoid awkwardness.

3.) If we see someone enter into a restroom and aren't sure of their gender, just keep an eye on it, but otherwise let it go.

Simple enough. I have several friends in the LGBTQ community, and it doesn't bother me none.  My boss pulls me aside and says he wants me at special duty today.  This basically consisted of hanging around the ticketing area to deal with unruly customers. And also responding to any calls over the radio.  I couldn't imagine being needed for anything, but fuck was I ever wrong.  

Soon after I was at the ticketing area dealing with an irate waste of life.  A gentleman was not happy that it was ""Fag day"".  

WoL: This is bullshit.  I came here from Vermont. And I can't spend a day with my kids here because some queers wanna prance around?  This is wrong!

Me: Sir.  Im gonna need you to stop swearing and calm down

WoL:  Who are you? Some gay lover? Working for a gay loving company? 

Me: Sir I'm not even gonna deal with this today.  It's not even 10am and you're already winning bigot of the day.  We don't want your money, so you can take your kids and leave.  

WoL: And what are you going to do about it?

Me:  Me?  Ask you to leave.  And let you get worked up until something happens. Then I'll hold you here in front of your kids till those nice cops over there arrest you for assault, public disturbance, and whatever else they can tack on there.  

He decided it was a good time to leave at that point.  I wish i could say this was the only person like this. But most of the day was spent asking several people to leave the ticketing area. We had one arrest from a guy who threatened a ticket girl.  Several instances of people threatening to ""sue for discriminating my religious liberties""  Dafuq?

One of these ladies was priceless:

Lady: This is wrong. I will sue. You're forcing beliefs that aren't my own onto me and my children. You'll corrupt them.  

Me: Ma'm sitting here saying Jesus doesn't approve would also constitute forcing your beliefs on others.  And everyone seems to be having a good time. I apologize if this makes you uncomfortable but they bought entrance to the park.

L: You need to read the Bible and see what Jesus says about the gays.

Me: He doesn't say anything. It's all old testament.  It's next to the part that says you can't eat shellfish, or cut your hair, or wear clothing of mixed fibers.  Doesn't stop you from cutting your hair though.

L:  This place is the hell on earth! You're all demons!

M: Have a great day!

It was awful. I've never heard worse things in my life.

-Grade 3 Pain: Temporal (So...your TIME hurts? Do you mean headache? Because that's pretty fucking SPECIFIC for a headache)

-Grade 3 Heart Problem (No shit. Which one?)

-Grade 1 Hearing Problem (Usually not an issue. Queried for 'Hearing Impared', they said no. Amended to 'Dizziness'. Given the symptoms, queried for 'Vertigo'. Said no again. Said ""fuck it"" and gave up)

-Grade 2 Pain (Along the same lines as above. Not normally an issue; queried for location. They said they didn't know. Medical professionals forgot to ask the patient ""what hurts""?)

Tales from a former Amusement Park Security Guard-Getting arrested for $3,159,17o0c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/17o0c2/tales_from_a_former_amusement_park_security/,26,1359681665.0,"Hey everyone. After several successful post in [r/Talesfromretail](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/)  I have decided to post some of my other work stories on here.  

I worked at two different amusement parks, two different summers.  These jobs were hellish. Easily the worst jobs I've ever had, and thats including a psych hospital.  One park was a small regional family park that may or may not be the oldest theme park in America.  The other, is a theme park owned by Ted Turner, that we will call ""Five Penants"".

*Five Penants* was the absolute worse company to work for. Between their modern day slavery tactics (bringing people over on work programs from other countries, charging them food and rent, and not allowing them to leave the hotel except for work), the price gouging (Don't go to the Johnny Rockets in their parks. It's literally the same thing as all the other burgers in the park for double the price), and treatment of guests & employees (writing me up for providing first aid to someone suffering from heat exhaustion, instead of leaving her on the ground and directing people around her till EMT's got there). And lets not forget how many pedophiles we caught the one summer I worked there ( I was involved with 4 or 5 myself).

Anyways, the job was shitty, beyond shitty.  Guards were given a 2 hour training course that basically consisted of how to kiss ass and not piss off the customers.  A brief overview of the map of the park, and next day you're out there on your own.  The one thing they really wanted us to enforce was guest going withing the fences that surround a ride.  This was the year that another *Five Penants* park in Georgia, had a kid die when he jumped over two fences to get his hat, only to be killed by the Batman rollercoaster.  All rides had a fence around it, and if any part of the ride got within 15 feet of the ground, there was a second fence around that part.  Park policy was pretty strict. Anyone caught going over the fence was ejected from the park with a 100 year ban.  Why 100 years? Because logic.

So me, being an intelligent human being, assumed that this wouldn't really be an issue.  Fences are there for a reason and who would want to climb a fence into one of these areas where dangerous machines are flying by?  Obviously I was wrong. Super wrong.  We had several issues a week of people hopping fences. Usually to retrieve personal items that fell off during a ride.  It was insane how many people we caught going over into these areas.  The only explanation I can offer now is that all these people must be related, and their father is the judge who keeps letting Lindsay Lohan out of jail. 

So one hot, summer day, I'm out in my cheap polyester uniform, sweating to death because why pay a lot for good uniforms that are only be worn for 5 months? It'll be smarter to buy uniforms that when you wear them, it feels like someone scraping sandpaper over your nipples after you just ran a marathon.

Anyways, I'm walking, and I see a woman and her young child sitting on a wall in front of a fence.  The woman is watching the exit of the Batman coaster, obviously waiting for someone to get off of it. The young boy has a basketball in his hand, and is throwing it up and catching it. It's one of those small basketballs that we give out as a prize for winning a midway game.  The kid is super excited, and throwing that ball in the air like it's a one man game of S.P.U.D.

Just then, the young boy throws the ball up in the air, and naturally, it flies behind him and sails over the fence and into the out of bounds area around the ride.  I can see this young lad staring, in disbelief at his quandary.  The ball is right there, *RIGHT THERE*. But unreachable.  I can only imagine that at that moment he felt like a fat woman on a treadmill, wearing a hat with a stick attached, dangling a twinkie just out of reach.  

Then, being a young child, he begins to cry.  The mother oblivious, picks him up and asks him whats wrong.  He points to the ball, and the mother turns, seeing the source of her sons despair.  She tries to calm him, but being a foot away from the ball, he is just trying to reach through the fence, apparently attempting to use the force to bring the ball towards him.  I walk over to the mother, and tell her I'll get another ball for her son.  I see its a ""Tar Heels"" college basketball design, in black. I walk over to the basketball game across the midway, and ask the kid to give me the same ball to give to the kid.  Told him to make a not on his sheet that whoever retrieves the ball at the end of the day just add it back into his stand so he's not penalized. Sign off on it, and go back to the young boy to give him his new ball.  He's happy, mother is appreciative, I'm a hero, all is right with the world.

But like a drunk sorority girl waking up after a night of drinking, unsure if she had removed her tampon before fucking that frat boy the previous night, something felt wrong.  I continued to patrol the area, and shortly after, I see a ""gentleman"" walking up to the mother and young boy. The boy is showing his ball to his dad, and the mother is pointing to the ball over the fence, then at the ball in her boys hand.  I can see this man, shake his head, and stand up on the wall.  Determined, he grabs the fence, and I can see him start to try and climb said fence.  WTF?

I run over, trying to get this guys attention.  He sees me, and steps down.  I tell him he can't climb the fence.  Now, let me take a moment here to digress.  I am not a handsome man.  Not ugly, but nothing special.  A 6 at best. Maybe a 7 if I dropped 40 lbs.  But I've always said if you ever want to feel good about how you look, go to a carnival, or amusement park.  The amount of human waste that walks around, just makes you feel better about yourself.  That kid from the movie ""Mask"" would leave any amusement park feeling like Hugh Hefner after getting his Viagra prescription filled: Unstoppable and slightly tired since he skipped his 3pm nap.

This gentleman, who we shall refer to as ""Bubba"", was a great example of the general population of the theme park.  A faded, stained, sleeveless tshirt, with the southpark characters as Saint Bernards on it.  Jean Shorts, with a chain wallet.  A beer gut that sticks out like a black guy at a clan meeting. And naturally, he's wearing sandals with socks on. And the socks are pulled up as far as they can go. Oh, and the smell of overpriced budweiser is apparent, even from 4 feet away.  This will play a factor....

Bubba: Well I'm getting my sons ball.

M: Sir, I already got him a replacement ball.

B: Yea but thats the one that I won. I paid $3 for it.

M: I understand sir, but its the same ball. I can understand you won that one for your son.  But i can't allow you to go over that fence. Rides are running and you could get killed.

Apparently, Bubba took this to mean ""Oh I understand sir. Go ahead and climb.""  He began to try and and climb again, his arms not strong enough to pull his massive frame more than a few inches, his sandals not giving him purchase on the iron bars.  I grab his shirt, and pull him down, using my radio to call for assistance as I do so.

Bubba, naturally did not enjoy me putting my hands on his shirt

B:DON'T TOUCH ME OR I'll SUE!

M: Stop trying to climb over the fence. There's a ride running and that ball is right near the track! Are you an idiot?

B: I PAID $3 AND WON THAT BALL. YOU'RE TRYING TO RIP ME OFF!

M: The prizes cost like $1 for every hundred of them.  We already make a huge profit off one person playing. Why would be want to rip you off for two? I gave your son the same damn ball. He is happy and you're the one making a scene!

B: IT'S THE BALL I WON! 

Keep in mind that this entire conversation is being punctuated at random points by the sound of the coaster running not 15 feet from where we stand.  Bubba keeps trying to walk over to the fence, and I keep blocking his path. Eventually he tries to shove me out of the way, and things got physical. His wife is screaming and his kid is playing with his ball, happy as can be.  My co workers were already there by this time, and we detained him till the police arrived. The police escort us him to our control trailer, and the whole time Bubba is yelling for everyone to hear ""THEY STOLE! FIVE PENANTS DOESN'T CARE! THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY! THEY STOLE FROM ME!""

The wife is crying, saying he's a good father.  Asking if we can let him go. We calm her down, and have her sit outside the trailer.  Cops run the guys record, and he's clean. We ended up just banning him for 100 years, and he got charged with disorderly conduct and public intoxication.  To this day I still don't know why he wasn't satisfied with  the replacement ball I gave to his son.

I are a roofer!,25,173yn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/173yn7/i_are_a_roofer/,7,1358922311.0,"In the comments of Alcohol and dangerous machines I said I'd post about joining the Navy but, true to form, I remembered that I had another job before doing that.

I was a roofer.

My step-father, at that time, owned a roofing company and, probably at the behest of my mother, gave me a job with one of his roofing crews.

A bit about my step-father. He was truly passionate about roofing. He had t-shirts and bumper stickers that said, ""I am a roofer"". He had divorced his wife with whom he had four sons. He was a pious man and his sons were absolute zealots. But this story isn't about his sons so, I'll tell you about them in the comments, if you're interested.

I figured, since I told him that I had done some *carpentry* with my grandfather who was a retired *carpenter* that he would put me on a shingle crew. Nope. Not how it works. Apparently everybody has to prove themselves on the hot tar crew, first. Do you know how hot *hot tar* is? I do. Disclaimer: I know it isn't tar. It's really asphalt (or bitumen if you prefer). Part of my job was to run the kettle. I had to use an axe to split the solid tar plugs (100 lbs./ea.) and ""load"" them in this seething cauldron of molten tar. The first job I was on had us pumping the tar up three stories so, I had to keep the tar between 525 and 550 degrees. Tar's flash point is around 450 degrees and it's auto-ignition temperature is only around 650 degrees. This is scary shit.

Onto the crew. Because I was the stepson of the owner, these guys really had it in for me. They did everything in their power to get me to quit from the outset. Couple this with a horrible commute and these were dark days for me. I had been drug free since I left high school but things change. I start smoking weed at night to help me sleep and taking crosstops (speed) during the day to keep me going.

Well, a roofing crew is small and it didn't take long for word to leak out. Pretty soon I was supplying the rest of the crew. **Especially** the foreman. He accounted for close to half of the consumption on the crew. The crew didn't let up on me ... they were just a lot friendlier.

Time turned into a blur. I went on job after job. Got hurt and worked through the pain. Out worked guys twice my size. Paid my dues (or so I thought). Still couldn't make it onto a shingle crew. My step-fathers guard dogs pissed on the nice chrome wheels of my ride and rusted them right through that pretty chrome.

The last job I was on was putting the very first roof on a large public storage facility. The area that this place was in was very well known for the wind that kicked up every single day around 2:30 to 3:00 in the afternoon. And it was a cold wind. Not germane to the story but several of the guys got hurt on this particular job.

One day, toward the end of the job, the wind really kicked up. We were almost done picking up our gear and were about ready to leave when, on a lark, I walked to the edge of the roof, opened and spread my jacket and leaned forward. The wind held me up! COOL!!! ""Hey guys! Look at this!"" All of a sudden one of them runs over and grabs me by the back of my pants and the collar of my jacket and throws me off the roof.

Now, in my mind, I'm convinced that this nut had thrown me forward over the barbed wire fence and above the train tracks running next to the storage place. The wind blew me over on to my back ... on the roof ... a good two feet back from where I started. In retrospect, the guy probably had just thrown me vertically to scare me but, I freaked.

About a week or so prior to this, I had decided that my body just couldn't take the drugs anymore so I had quit and told the rest of the crew that I would no longer be supplying their speed. Ah, I forgot to mention, I had been supplying it for free.

After this job, I and my step-father came to an agreed parting of ways. I heard from one of the guys that the foreman had been lobbying very hard to get me canned ever since my very first day. Even while he was gobbling almost half the speed I brought to work, he was trying his best to get me fired. After I stopped supplying him and especially after my post flight freak out, he insisted I be fired.

That was the last job I can remember having before joining the navy. There is a lot more stuff surrounding the personalities involved that don't belong in the tale itself. I may or may not cover them in the comments. We'll see. I promise, my next installment of The Chronicles of Rudraigh will be about the Navy. That's going to be weird. And long.",2013-01-23 08:25:11

Alcohol and dangerous machines,59,16nu3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16nu3u/alcohol_and_dangerous_machines/,27,1358305837.0,"I was asked to post the tale of my second job having only mentioned it in my first post.

My first job (at an Arby's) only lasted three days because the manager would only schedule me for three days a week, three hours a day. On the very day I quit that job I was hanging around the house shooting the breeze with my sister's boyfriend (Stubbs or Stubby or something like that). He says, why don't you come work with us doing tree and brush removal. Pays $20 a day whether you work or not."" I wondered how that worked but said ""Sure!""

Next day I meet his boss. He tells me that I would report for work every day but sometimes we would just hang out, drink and sharpen the chain saws and I would get $20 a day regardless.

HELL YES! Count me in!

A bit about the boss. He was apparently in his 40s but looked like he was in his 60s and had that glassy eyed look of a LONG time alcoholic.

A bit about my particular job. Three guys go ape-shit in a forest and I clear everything out and throw it into our chipper.

A bit about our chipper. The boss claimed it was the most powerful chipper around. This was back in the late 70s and this chipper was powered by a Chevy 283 ci. V8 engine. Yes, it was powerful for it's day. I see V8 chipper all over now but back then they were mostly 4 cylinder diesels. Anyway, this machine could eat a five inch diameter tree in seconds. Every bush branch and tree I threw into it had the chance of wrapping me up, sending me through and turning me into so much chili meat.

First day on the job, I go to the bosses house (that's where we were to meet each day) and everyone is sitting around his kitchen table doing vodka shots! I was offered a shot and, well duh, I went for it. Our job for that day was at a school to clear the brush out from around it. Seems the kids were hiding in the bushes, getting stoned and having sex. Y'know, the usual.

Well, I'm hauling this stuff as fast as I can but I'm falling behind and getting bawled out by the boss and the crew. Lunchtime rolls around and after I'd eaten my bologna sandwich I go up to the boss and say, ""Look, I'm doing the best I can but if that isn't good enough, just fire me and I'll get on down the road. No problem."" OMG! All of a sudden these guys are all hugging me (I'd never been hugged by any man but my grandfather) and saying what a man I am (I was 17) to just come out and say that. WTF? So ok, I'm in good with these guys and they back off on the yelling and turn it more towards good natured ribbing about me falling behind. The day ends well, I'm exhausted and $20 richer.

Ah! Forgot to mention that the boss was nipping from a flask ... all ... day ... long.

Next day, same place, same outcome.

Third day, it rained. I showed up at the bosses house and we spent all day drinking vodka and sharpening chain saws. Oh, and playing cards. What the hell, I got paid $20 for that day. I can really be down with this!

The next day was just some light clean up at the school. Only took a couple of hours but, I got paid my $20. Bossman said to not come back to his place as he had some things to do. Okie dokie!

Next day I go to his house but nobody is around. I wait and wait. Finally Stubby (remember him?) shows up but not in his pickup. He's in a little import car.

Seems bossman got drunked up, stole Stubby's pickup and wrecked it and ended up in County jail. So much for that job.

I heard, many months later, that bossman, with a different and reduced crew, managed to have one of those bushes, branches or trees wrap him up and send him through the chipper. I've never been able to determine if that was true or not but, I wouldn't doubt it was likely. He was always drunk and that chipper was very powerful. He almost lost a finger on my first day.

Plot twist! Stubby sold weed to supplement his income. He was an Olympic class rower!

A real Mickey Mouse operation,19,16kel3,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16kel3/a_real_mickey_mouse_operation/,5,1358191112.0,"I posted most of this as a comment to give insight on a post in /r/talesfromretail, but thought I'd post it here too. There's a tl:dr at the bottom.

I work as a security guard for a large company, and I live in Canada, where employees seem to have rights.

About 2 months ago, a paper copy of an e-mail was brought to my site, and it instructed me that I was to view and sign off on some bilingual inspection requirement. (Basically test you, then sign it, is what I understood), and it was to be submitted to the client company by the 1st of January.

This video was not available, so I e-mailed my supervisors, listing the missing files. My Manager replies, telling me to resend the e-mail, as I forgot to attach the files.......Q.Q...

After clarifying that there were no files attached, that that was the issue, I was CC'd on several e-mails between my managers, all showing that they intended to deal with the matter.

Cut to the 2nd of January, Wednesday. 
My employer calls me, asking why I hadn't completed the task, and I told them I hadn't received the video. 

The next day, they call me again. Why haven't I done it? ""The other site did it!"" - I still don't have the files, ""oh...I'll get on that"". 

*The next* day, the 4th of January, and the video *still* hadn't been made available. One of my managers calls me in a panic, says they will try and e-mail the video...5 minutes later, a call back, she doesn't know how to attach it, and no attempts to explain it could help her, so she decides to burn a disc...ok then.

An hour later, I get a disc dropped off at my site. Instead of containing the video, it's a bunch of unrelated Security Camera footage...I call them to let them know. This was about 1100, I finish work at 1600.

I hear nothing until about 1530, minutes before my shift ended. She was telling me I could either A) Sign off without viewing the video, B) Come in and view it after work, or C) Lose my job. (Keep in mind, I never sign anything without accepting that I'm liable if it should be false, and a company policy is to fire for making false reports, or lying)

A quick call to the Labour Board does nothing...so after work I go to their office, thereby fucking up my plans for the weekend, costing me 2 hours of my time (1h40m driving...), and I'm only going to be ""paid"" for the time spent in the office (about 10 minutes). I say ""paid"" because this company is notorious for forgetting to pay your hours, and I'm not about to fight for 10 minutes. (I fought for an hour once, the next week I was missing 4, and the following week they forgot 11).

To top it off, the fucking video (of which the video portion didn't work), was just a narration of an Act that states that companies such as the Third Party's are required to offer services in English and French, blablabla. They could have just linked the bloody legal document instead.

The best part is how I spoke with the labour board about the fact that they forced me to go to their office after work, and the Labour Board says they can do it.

**tl:dr: Company Management doesn't bother doing their job, leaves me to suffer because of their procrastinating, insufferable, and grossly inept abilities; Labour Board can't help me.**

The only good thing is that the member of the client company on the site I work, sent a record of the events that transpired to his HR rep (the one who requested this verification process in the first place), painting my company in a very bad light.

Edit: To clarify, the chain is like this. 3 Massive Corporations. 1 is Security Firm (mine), 1 is Client firm (Building Managers), 1 is Third Party (Building Tenants). Client Firm asked Security Firm to prove guards are biligual, as Third Party is required by law to greet guests in both English and French.

I do not like my company in the slightest. I feel more like a member of the Third Party company than I do part of my own company.

Feeling like Lucy",33,16lb9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16lb9u/feeling_like_lucy/,7,1358216290.0,"The first job I ever had was assembling installation kits (@ $0.15/ea.) and manuals (@ $0.10/ea.) for ultrasonic burglar alarms for the company my mother worked at. Eh, it got me some smoking money and actually allowed me to help my mother to buy me some new bedroom furniture (we weren't exactly well off). But this is not that tale.

My first job after high school was an entry level position at and Arby's. The manager would only schedule me for three hours a day, three days a week, at the then minimum wage of around $3.25/hr. I asked him how he expected me to eat *and* afford to buy gas to get to work for $29/week. He told me that I needed to *work* my way up. I worked my way up to quitting my first job but, this is not that tale.

My second job, attained the very day I walked off the previous job, was for a tree and brush clearing service. They paid $20/day  whether we worked or not. Hey! Cool! That job lasted one week. The boss got drunk and stole the foreman's truck, wrecked it and ended up in the County jail. This too is not that tale.

I ended up signing with a temp agency. They sent me out to various weird jobs and, for the most part, I got along fairly well. Then there was this one job. **THIS** is that tale.

I ended up getting sent to this place that packaged household chemicals. The line I got assigned to was filling boxes of some kind of caustic chemical (perhaps dishwashing detergent but I can't remember). The job was simple: these boxes would come out of the line with a plastic liner filled with detergent. I was to weigh them and, if they were light, throw a little more product in there to bring it up to the proper weight. The line foreman insisted this was very important (relevant later) I think you see where this is going. He showed me how to do it and I grokked things pretty well so he left me to the job. Literally seconds later, every single box came through either too light or with the plastic liner flopped over so it couldn't be filled at all. Well, I hit the emergency shut-down button and bring the line to a halt. The foreman comes out of the inky shadows looking for blood and in a split-second makes a beeline for me. He start screaming at me for shutting down the line. I pointed to the offending boxes and he sort of calmed down. Some adjustments were made, the foreman showed me my job again, again I grokked it and said I was good to go, again he left and again, seconds later every single box came through under-weight. Not wanting to be the target of the foreman's wrath, I kicked into insanely high gear.

To. No. Avail.

I had boxes backing up like crazy. It was literally like the scene from I Love Lucy in the chocolate factory. Well, except I wasn't eating the detergent.

Some guy on the line finally saw how far in the weeds I was and hit the button. Line comes to a halt and out comes the foreman, making a beeline straight at me again. He starts screaming at me again (I've been on the job for perhaps 30 minutes). I show him that every single box is underweight and suddenly he scream, ""IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT!""

*cue jaw drop*

He yanks me off the line and makes me a janitor. Right off the bat I'm sent to clean a restroom that someone (likely him) had just destroyed. The head janitor was standing outside the door with his arms crossed just staring at me. A few minutes later, the line foreman shows up and asks him very loudly if I had ""fucked anything up yet.""

I kicked the mop bucket over onto both their shoes and walked out. Total time on the job, 45 minutes from the time I walked in to the time I walked out. The shortest job I've ever had.

**TL;DR:**  Mmmm ... chocolate.

Please remove my skin,75,16lgw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16lgw3/please_remove_my_skin/,9,1358220622.0,"Right on the heals of my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16lb9u/feeling_like_lucy/), here's another.

As related in the previous post, I was being farmed out by a temp agency, going out to various companies to do whatever the hell they wanted us to do. One of those places took those five gallon soda kegs and stamped the name of whatever company was leasing them onto the shell. That was where the alcoholic forklift driver fell asleep on the forklift and ran the blades right through the wall. I then learned how to drive a forklift. But, this is not that tale.

I was sent to this place many miles away from home as a general dog's body. On the way there, I was doing exactly the speed limit, having been busted multiple times for speeding before I turned 18, when this dick started honking at me and then made an insane, high-speed pass (on surface streets, not the freeway) and flipping me off as he did so. I grumbled and wished he would get busted. BAM! A few hundred yards down the road, there he was, pulled over by the local constabulary! Justice!

I get to work and find out the totality of my duties is to load scrap fiberglass insulation and scrap cardboard into a **HUGE** compactor/baler. And, I didn't have to do it alone! (YAY!) oops, too soon. My partner is a moron.

The idea is, toss a bunch of insulation into the baler and then put in a big piece of cardboard in order to give the resulting bale some structure, otherwise it will fall apart. The baler had a vertical shaft into which we pitch the material which is then compressed horizontally into the bale. Ok. Except my partner kept throwing the cardboard into the shaft horizontally (relevant in a sec). I told him, ""Look, you handle the insulation and I'll handle the cardboard and whatever insulation you don't get to.""

Well, I had to jump down off of the ""beast"" to get some more material. When I climbed back up, I saw that my partner had thrown a big piece of cardboard ... horizontally ... into the hopper. We had a cubic yard of fiberglass insulation at the bottom of the shaft with a nice cap of cardboard sitting right on top acting like a lid. As I leaned over and saw this, and my eyes went wide and I opened my mouth to scream, ""SSSTTTOOOPPP!!!"", My partner hoisted a two by four and slammed it down to knock the offending piece of cardboard down into the baler.

Cue fountain of fiberglass dust blowing directly into my face, up the sleeves of my shirt, into the neck of my shirt, even down into the top of my jeans.

I fell off the baler (causing much consternation on the floor of the place) screaming with pain and choking on the dust. And, lucky me, this happened at the end of the shift.

I was led to the eye washing station, choking and coughing, to clear my eyes so I could see (the whole time my partner swearing it wasn't his fault) and I was already starting to feel the itch.

My local boss told me to go home early and he would sign for a whole day (this being only 15 minutes before quitting time ... thank you too much!).

Some things I haven't mentioned yet: it's winter, my car doesn't have a heater, I'm wearing a flannel shirt. It's completely impregnated with fiberglass.

I go out to my car and start it up and head down the road. Oh shit. One of my headlights is out. I can barely see. I have no heat. I can barely see. I am FUCKING MISERABLE!

I get home after more than an hour of driving (took half as long that morning), threw away my shirt and showered till I ran out of hot water. Went to bed utterly exhausted and still itching like crazy.

Woke up the next morning and started dressing in fresh clothes, dreading going back to that place when ... the phone rings. It's the temp agency telling me that the company I had worked at the day before, ""no longer needed my services.""

Mixed feelings.

**TL:DR:** Doc, it hurts when I do this.

"""The floors look dull...""",55,16eggf,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16eggf/the_floors_look_dull/,7,1357939982.0,"A few years ago I took on a job at a well known office store. I applied for a computer tech position but was called and asked if I would be interested in doing custodial/maintenance while I trained into the tech position. 

I was well versed in floor care and so the job was nothing new to me. I was shown the floor machines and the stock of pads for the floor they had. For those who do not know, the shiny floors are places like Wal-Mart are due to being waxed, the machines that they run on the floors have a large semi-abrasive pad under the machine that heats up the wax as it crosses over and the melted wax then fills all the small scratches etc. to make the floor shiny again.

The pads last for about a week of constant use but have to be changed so that they will still get the wax melted. 

On day one, I saw that we had a couple boxes of cleaning pads (red) and 1 single buffing pad (Light brown). I informed the manager that I had to have the brown pads to keep the floor nice and he said he would make it happen.

2 months go by and I am still using the first pad I had and was accomplishing absolutely nothing. With repeated requests to get the correct cleaning supplies (This included a broom which they did not have) I was finally informed that they could not get me the pads I needed. 

Alright fine, I will do what I can with the old one then. Fast forward 3 weeks and I am stopped on the floor by the manager and he says the following, "" I have noticed that the floors have been getting dull and are not as nice as when you first arrived. I understand that once the excitement of a new job wears off it is easy to start slacking, however please make sure that you are doing your best as it reflects on the whole store if the floors look bad.""

I was at a loss for words. I have been working here 3 days a week 5am to 8am doing the dirty work in this store without any of the required supplies and am now being blamed for the floors not looking good. Priceless.

This was 1 of 2 jobs I ever walked out on. The manager had this misconception that the industrial strength amonia based floor sanitizer they had me using attracted flies. Granted, there was a lot of flies in the back around the bathroom, but it was from the drains in the floor, not the water. 

He told me to not leave dirty water in the mop bucket and while it was kinda dumb due to it instantly killing anything that got in it, I did as I was told. One day I had a clean bucket of water that I had not used and knew I would be back in the morning, so I left if in the cleaning closet. 

I get a call when I am about 10 miles away that he found the bucket of water. I said I did not think it was a problem as it was clean and he promptly informed me that I needed to come back to the store to empty the bucket. I said that I was 10 miles away and he told me that he feels that the only way I will learn is by being punished and coming back to dump it. 

So, off the clock I go back and dump said bucket and never went back to that job again. I was working 2 jobs, and this one was just spending money so it didn't really hurt me financially, but it was not worth the hassle.

According to the people that were there it was quite a nice party, good food, some stupid music, and cheap booze (booze cannot be given for free on company parties in this country, or something like that...).

I was registered for it a month before, and technically I could have gone there, if it wasn't for this stupid schedule that put me on nightshift for exactly that day. I was a bit enraged about that, this has been the 3rd time in two years that  something like that happens to me for company events. They know that I registered for the event, they have the list of people that registered, and so they make me work that day. 

But well, I actually wasn't in the mood for party anyway, and weekend nightshift is nice and relaxing. Also they promised catering for the poor souls that had to work instead of partying. 

The ""catering"" by the way looked as if it already had been eaten by    someone. Even after eating it I wasn't sure if that wasn't the case.

But that was not the part which really made me furious. 

The part that made me furious was the mail from my boss the next week that noted that of 20 people of our team registered only 15 had come, and that we (personally!) were responsible for squandering money that could have been used for something else.

Hmm... short check... I had to work on the night of the party, my colleague worked 6am shift the next morning, and three people were on sickleave.

* I am not a goddamn maid or your mother. I have other duties that do not include picking up after you. It's a pain in the ass to be in the middle of something and have to pick up trash that you decided to leave behind. There are garbage cans *EVERYWHERE*, use one.

* Muscleheads, put the fucking weights back when you're done. They go on the racks, not stacked on the goddamn floor. That goes for the benches as well; don't move them all over the gym. Keep them in their designated area.

* When we say that the gym's closed, it's fucking closed. Don't mill around the locker rooms or decide that closing time's the perfect time to take a fifteen minute shower.

A tale from the land of food,36,14xf34,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/14xf34/a_tale_from_the_land_of_food/,3,1355632357.0,"I worked as a grocery store cashier for all five of my highschool years. I have posted some of the customer stories on TFR, but I would like to share with you. Sorry if it gets wall-of-text-ish.

**i) Sick Daze**

This one happened about three years in. I was sick. I mean hug-the-toilet sick. I called in saying I couldn't make it - the first time I ever had. The manager says 'Ok, we'll find someone,' which is what I'd expect, given that we don't get an up-to-date phone sheet.

Next day is a staff meeting to get our new uniforms. Why couldn't we get them when we next came in? Because half the staff only came in nights and weekends, and management didn't want to either stay later than 4 pm or leave the shirts out in the open. I call to see how long the meeting will be so I can arrange rides.

I get chewed out over the phone for not covering my shift. And told that I will get lectured when I get to the staff meeting. No one ever did lecture me, though.

**ii) Stop picking on the shop lifter!**

So there was a man who came into the store and he always had a backpack. It would generally be empty when he came in (not that we checked, but the bag was , well, baggy, so it was obvious) and full when he left. A group of us noticed and told the store owner after a while.

Response? Stop picking on him.

**iii) Vacay Melee**

Booking time off at that store was a disaster. You and anyone else would write your name on the day you wanted off on a calendar, and when the schedule was made, the manager would look at the calendar and decide who got what days off. There was no way to say who wrote their's first, or what they wanted to do, so someone who wanted to party would get the day off while the one trying to go to the dentist would have to figure it out.

About a year in, I was going on a week's vacation with my family. I had requested it off well in advance, had told my manager verbally and left written notes. The schedule comes out.

Week one - One shift.

Week two - Three shifts.

Week three - Five shifts.

Week three was the one I booked off. Trying to be good, I found other people to cover most, but the last one no one would get back to me on. So I told the manager (again) that I was going to be in a different country, and that I tried and only needed a person to cover one last shift. She did take care of it, but it was frustrating having to remind her for the fifth time that I would be OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

**iv) Clairvoyance is not part of the job description**

As a cashier at this grocery store, it was always a good idea to check the schedule when you came in, because the cash manager had a habit of changing things and not telling anyone.

Well, I worked on Sunday, and my next scheduled day was Friday. Sweet! Time to get homework done *and* socialize!

Wednesday rolls around, and I get a call from my manager. ""You were supposed to be in half an hour ago!"" I tell her that I'm not, and she tells me she gave me the shift.

Now, I know it wasn't there Sunday. I'd checked. So I ask when she gave it to me. Apparently, she did that on Monday.

I asked her how I was supposed to know that I had a new shift if no one called me, and she backed down. It may have also had something to do with the fact that I told her I was babysitting my nephew (not entirely true, but that's besides the point).

Surprisingly, she actually learned and even started *asking* if I could take extra shifts once the schedule was out.

**v) Gold star for doing diddly**

I tried at the start to be good and do extra jobs when it was quiet, but no one cared so I stopped. I was the best dang cashier I could be when the customer was there and that was it. No cleaning the bathrooms or break room. No facing. Nada

Customers loved me. It may have been the fact most of the time the other cashiers I worked with would rather talk to each other about what they did last Friday than make friendly with the customer. I like to think it was my charming personality. Either way, being a customer favourite endeared me to my manager, who after a long while started to adore me.

There was another cashier, let's call her Goody. She cleaned like there was no tomorrow, faced, and other assorted chores. But, since she didn't spend as much time getting a good reputation with the customers, she lost out. I got my days off, she didn't. I got good shifts, she didn't.

Heck, I had a customer like me enough to warn me that my manager had customers that she'd asked to keep an eye on us. When Goody, who was bagging, tried to speak up, the customer snaps ""I wasn't talking to you!"" at her and turns back to me.

That was how I learned that it's not going the extra mile that gets you places, but kissing ass.",2012-12-16 06:32:37
Racism in the Workplace,46,14sy55,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/14sy55/racism_in_the_workplace/,15,1355431601.0,"So, at my current job, I need to fill out a Packing List for anything going from one [COMPANY] site to another [COMPANY] site. I filled out one today for two honkin' 27"" Dell Monitors. I don't understand why the heck the dude needed these, but his manager approved them, so it's not my problem. They're going from Boston to Denver.

So, I fill it out, and lay it down on top of the monitors that I wheel over with help from my co-worker. (Seriously, you'd be surprised how big the box for a 27"" Monitor is). Drop it off, go back to work, figuring that's that.

About 10 minutes later, our shipping guy comes back. Let's call him ""Mark"". Now, Mark is a greying man of about 60 years in age, and has been at [COMPANY] for about 20 years in the shipping department. Content with his relatively easy job, not supporting a family, the works. Always kind of liked working with the guy, but never really got to know him.

He slaps the Packing Slip on my desk without saying anything, startling me out of my [music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz8T9J_7vKg). I take out a headphone and look up at him. Here's the exchange.

>**Me:** Hey Mark. What's up?

>**Mark:** Hey, you have a contact number?

>**Me:** What do you mean, a contact number?

At this point, I glance down at the sheet. The phone number for our Denver office is right there as it should be.

>**Mark:** I mean a contact for us. When we ship this, we need to know a name of who it's going to.

>**Me:** *Confused* Well, it's going right to this guy.

I glance at the sheet and point to the name written directly above **our own Denver address**. Now, it bears noting, this person has a heavily Indian name. I won't release it to keep things anonymous.

>**Mark:** Oh! I thought that was the name of a company! That shit's not American.

>**Me:** ...No, it's going to Denver. [INDIAN NAME] is the name of the person it's going to.

>**Mark:** No way that's... Okay, I thought that was the name of a company. You sure that's a person?

>**Mark:** I didn't know we had any **Dot Heads** in Denver. Don't they all live like in Florida or something?

>**Me:** It's going to Denver. That's the name of the person it's being distributed to.

And then he turns and walks out of the office, staring at the paper in absolute disbelief, muttering to himself over and over.

"""A big BLACK guy threatened me in the shower!""",29,1352w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1352w4/a_big_black_guy_threatened_me_in_the_shower/,3,1352839044.0,"I used to work at a gym (most of my crazy stories start that way) and on Saturdays we closed at 4:30 pm because most of our members were office workers and mostly worked out during the weekdays.  Naturally, if anything went bad on a shift, it always went bad at 4:15 pm and we'd always have to try to scramble to resolve things before 4:30 so we wouldn't have to stay late.

One afternoon at 4:15 pm, I'm at the front desk with my coworker and the manager on duty Dante.  A little (5'3"", 130lbs) white guy in swimming trunks and dripping with water speed walks up to the front desk and says, ""A big BLACK guy just threatened me in the shower!""  To put this in perspective he says this to three black guys who are all at least 6 feet tall.  We're sort of stunned because of the emphasis on BLACK, altercations between members were extremely rare, and we had accounted for who was still left and none of our usual troublemakers were around.  We asked him what happened and he doens't really say anything specific but keeps repeating that a ""big BLACK guy"" threatened him in the shower and he asks us to go back in there with him.  

So we go with him to the shower.  At this point, I had been at the gym for several years, so I'd seen more naked old men than most people, no sweat, but going into a shower to resolve  a dispute or follow up on a threat is just uncomfortable.  It was a 3-sided open shower with roughly 7 or 8 shower heads.  The four of us go in there and there's an ancient white guy showering and lo and behold a big (6'3"", 285lbs) black guy showering.  As soon as he sees us he basically gives the ""I can't believe this shit"" face and he and the white guy get into it.  Through their bickering we determined that the big black dude was showering and the little white guy started showering right next to him despite the fact that there were other showerheads available.  It apparently made the big black guy uncomfortable and he said something to the little white guy and it escalated.  At one point the ancient white guy yells at the two of them to stop arguing, just shower, and leave.  The big black guy was physically intimidating but his attitude seemed very low key and he seemed inclined to just want to shower and leave.  After a couple minutes we felt everything was ok and went back to the desk.

Five minutes later, the little white guy comes out and says he wants us to call the police for him (this was right before cell phones were ubiquitous) and we're all just like ""Fuck, we're going to be here late, again!""  But he made it clear that he felt very threatened by the ""big BLACK guy"" so we called. The big black guy came out a few minutes later and with the news of the police being called decided to stick around.  The big black guy trolled him a bit while they were waiting for the cops  saying stuff like ""Yeah, I've seen guys like you before.  I'm not scared of you.  I had a judge roll up on me once, and I put him in his place.""  The little white guy periodically retorted with stuff like ""I'm not going to let some big BLACK guy go around threatening me.  I don't let that kind of stuff happen.""  We heard the phrase ""big BLACK guy"" no fewer than 15 times during the whole ordeal.  Perhaps it was a pure statement of fact but the emphasis on the BLACK became increasingly comical the more he said it.

Obviously without any physical violence, the call wasn't a very high priority so we had to wait maybe 20 or 30 minutes for police to show up.  They talked to the guys together and then separately and in a nutshell told them both to grow up.  No police report was filed.  We filed an incident report internally, which meant absolutely nothing and that was that with us leaving work more than an hour late on a Saturday.

Yesterday the phone lines were a little wacky, so they transferred the lines to our answering service (they typically answer the calls from 9PM to 7AM).
Well, we can go on the answering service's website to monitor calls as they happen. So we were returning the most urgent/important ones via cell phones. 
We got a call from a disgruntled former employee, Sarah, asking about our insurance. The answering service employee offered to transfer her to the general manager's cell phone and Sarah's response was a little unexpected. ""I would rather bathe in HIV needles than talk to that woman."" Keep in mind that she wasn't rude or angry. She said it so matter-of-factly. Everyone was monitoring these calls so a lot of people heard it.
The bizarre part of it is that the manager had nothing to do with her being fired. She worked in an entirely different department. I don't know where the animosity came from. But it was understood that we were all supposed to act like we didn't hear anything.",2012-12-01 21:56:46

One fine morning this individual (Bill) and I were accepting a delivery. About $20k worth of stock (no way in hell we could fit it all in the stock areas, but such is how it goes when you work with monkeys). We had taken the stuff off the truck and were in the arduous process of finding places in the stock room to put it all (which I always referred to as the Worlds Most Difficult Tetris Game).

Bill opens a box of hazelnut syrup - syrups for the coffees because apparently everyone wants coffee that tastes like Hazelnut for some mysterious reason. 
He tips the bottle upside down slowly, and appears amazed when nothing comes out (because the lid is on).

"A story about my evil-ex-boss and ""the last day""",99,11sytl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/11sytl/a_story_about_my_evilexboss_and_the_last_day/,31,1350753718.0,"It was suggested by some folks over in /r/talesfromtechsupport that this would be a proper venue for this story, and I apologize if it is not.

A little set-up is required.  I was doing tech support at an engineering firm, working for an egg-shaped man with a hitler moustache.  I was WAY beyond what I was actually being allowed to do, so I had a tendency to ignore my evil-ex-boss and just get the job done, no matter how many toes I had to step on.  To this day, i'm sure he thinks that it is I, and not he, who was the idiot in this relationship-gone-wrong.

I was obviously unhappy with this situation, and had been sending out resumes as if that were still something fashionable to do.  And on this very day, I had managed to score an interview with a promising-looking start-up.

On the previous day, I had cause to visit my boss's office, only to note that he had a management screen up for the VM server I had spent months carefully setting up and populating for an overseas project.  He was actually trying to MANAGE it.  Without really even knowing what the word ""virtualization"" meant.  And inevitably, was going to break it, and then blame me for making it in the first place.

After YEARS of putting up with his bullshit, I decided to put my foot down.  I consoled into MY VM server, took away his permissions, and changed the root password.  It probably bears noting that by this time, I had memorized the location of every fire axe in our warehouses, in case I wanted to plant one right in his fool moustache.

So there I was, going about my dreary business, when my phone rings.  It's the HR director.  ""Hey, Rum, can you scoot over to my office for a minute?""  ""My plate's kinda full, I've got a user with the wrong user name, a console with a bad keyboard...  is this something that can wait?""  ""No, actually, I need to see you right now.""  ""Sure thing, I'll just finish up what i'm working on and be right over.""

Naively, I'm thinking her laptop is acting up again due to yet another trojan... caused by yet another toolbar... that she downloaded.  But, no, I am in for a surprise.

I get to her office, and say, ""what can I do for you?""

""There's no tactful way to say this, but I'll try.  The board of executives has decided to let you go.""

""Let me go where?""

""... you're fired.  Frankly, we know you've been looking for other work, and it was suggested that you might sabotage the company's infrastructure.""

""Sabotage?  Really?  After everything I've done to keep this company going despite its incompetent management?""

""Yeah.  You have ten minutes to clean out your desk.  We'll comp you for the rest of the day, naturally.""

She walks me over to my desk, and there is my evil-ex-boss with a shit-eating grin on his face.  ""I'm gonna need all the company property you have.""

""Here's your phone, here's your computer that you don't know how to operate.  I'm taking all MY stuff, and don't you dare get in my way.""  He observed as I took down the Wall of Me and carefully packed it in a box.  Lifted an eyebrow when I took a couple of decent beers out of the company fridge.  I kept all the thumbtacks out of spite.

Now, one other little detail, not particularly relevant to the job itself.  My cousin had been in and out of the hospital for months, and we didn't know why.  Pursuant to this, she asked if I could manage a laptop for her.  We had a ton of old laptops gathering dust, and I asked the guy in charge of them if I could borrow one?  He handed me one and said, ""Yeah, keep it.""

So, my evil-ex-boss is escorting me to the door, with my box of my possessions, and he says ""I understand you have one of our laptops.  We're gonna hold your final paycheck until we get that back.""

Fine.  Glad to be out of this shithole.  If I ever see again, anywhere, for any reason, I will cut open your belly and force-feed you your own entrails.  My parting words?  ""There's no love lost.""  And home I went.

I come stumbling in with my box of crap from my desk, and my flatmate is crying her eyeballs out, and then notices me.  ""What happened?"" she asks.

""I got sacked.  What's with all the waterworks?""

""I have ovarian cancer and I'm probably going to die.""

Well... shit.  ""I have to step out for a bit.  I'm going to buy an enormous quantity of booze.  Anything I can get you?""

""Tequila,"" she says.

""Back in a jiffy.  Are you done with that laptop?  My final paycheck kind of depends on it.""

""No.  But I will make it so,"" she says with a sigh.

So, I buy some booze, and we both get likkered up.

Next day, dawn broke hard, and my first thought was, ""I still have undrunk booze.""  And if you ever start a day at 7 am with more than one shot of 151, it ain't gonna end well.  This one certainly didn't.

So I've got this laptop, and this friggin' useless retard trying to make me dance for my last paycheck.  And, drunk as all hell, I call him up and leave some voicemail.  ""You foul foul filth piece of foul foul filth, I have your foul foul filth laptop, and I'm bringing it in monday.  And if don't get a receipt, I'm gonna pound your face until my fist is as broken as your face, you useless retard.""

Then I blacked out, and I didn't really remember doing that either.  Until Monday rolled around.

Monday morning, and I'm having the worst hangover ever.  My flatmate says to me, ""the police were here, I told them you were out.""

""Well, what did they want?""

""They didn't say.""

""It's probably about that damned laptop, maybe they reported it stolen, and I'll be damned if I want to see my evil-ex-boss again.  I'm gonna have my friend drop it off and get a receipt for it.""

So, laptop returned, receipt in hand... I think this is OVER.  Boy was I wrong.

Cop comes rolling around.  Pretty little thing, decked out in as much body armor as her slight frame will allow.  ""Can I speak to Rum?""

""Yeah, what's up?""

""Keep your hands where I can see them!""

""OK... who are you, and why are you here.""

""I am a police officer, and you made some threats against you ex-employer.""

""... what now?  They have their stupid piece-of-shit laptop, I have a receipt for it.""

""You threatened to punch him in the face until your fist was a broken as his face.""

""... oh.  Yeah I guess I did do that.  I just want my last paycheck, and to have nothing more to do with these jerks.""

Cop goes away.  Next day, a certified letter with a paycheck in it.  Hooray!  I'm done.  All I need to do is cash this, and my business with these jerks is concluded.  Or so I think.

So I cash the check.

A week later, I get another certified letter.  The check bounced.  My final paycheck?  From a special account that was made out of rubber.  So, I give the money back to bank.  Not much choice, and I'm planning my next move.

Another week later, I get the bombshell.  It's another certified letter, from my ex-employer, demanding THEIR money back from the check I attempted to cash.  Accusations that I was defrauding them, over a rubber check THEY cut ME.

So, I did the most reasonable thing I could think of without spending money.  I sent them a registered letter.  It said, basically, ""you cut me a rubber check and then demanded money I never actually got back.  You can give me actual money, plus the $25 it cost me in transaction fees, or I can consult a lawyer about a harassment suit.  pick one.""

They cut me two checks.  A real paycheck, and a check for $25.  I never cashed the latter, I still have it.

And that is the tale of my last day in tech support.",2012-10-20 20:21:58

I used to do lots of miscellaneous stuff, mostly web maintenance and graphic design, for a small family-owned business.  Being the one person who knew how to install Windows (as well as being competent with a search engine), I was naturally the self-titled ""Makeshift IT Guy"".  I'll add that I had and still have a good relationship with these people, only there were some ways they ran the company that I wasn't too fond of.  Anyways, here's some random things off the top of my head that I dealt with/observed at my time with this company:

* was assigned the task of installing a Costco-purchased 16-camera security system.  I actually had fun doing this, except for the fact that I had to put one on the wall behind my desk literally staring at my back.  The other 2 cubicles in the office (for order takers and another designer) had to have the same thing.

* was yelled at for countless stupid things.  One of which was hanging my jacket on the back of my chair.  I was told to use the coat rack in the front of the office like the other warehouse employees (who don't have desks).  Mind you, i was 22 when this happened.

* one of my coworkers (years ago) was scolded for building a spreadsheet for logging excess material for a product that was cut to size in house from a larger stock. (i.e. something came in 50"" pieces, was then cut down to lengths of 10"", 12"", 14"", etc.  The guy doing this was individually measuring each piece of waste, taking hours to do.  The spreadsheet just simply took inventory of the pieces cut and calculated the waste)

* Was scolded many times for using the computers for personal use.  I would do things like check my personal email, look on craigslist, check my bank statements, etc.  That's fine and I completely understand that policy.  However, the last time i got in trouble for this, i was informed that they've been using a keylogger this whole time on *every* computer in the office.  Time to change my passwords...

* Was asked a few times to help out the owners' son (who also worked for his parents) with his college homework.  Help out as in do it.  I would only agree to work through stuff with him.  That didn't matter though, as they had his girlfriend, yet another employee of this company, work his assignments on company time.  They literally payed her to take an online college course (which i presume they were also paying for) under his name while he worked for their company.  I decided to not get involved with that whatsoever.



That's all I can think of right now.  Being there for ~7 years, I'm sure I have a lot more material, but it's not coming to mind.  Anyways, I now have a much better job at a bigger company that treats their employees like responsible adults.  It's great.",2012-10-20 01:20:32

Prime example happened today. She's recently begun watching Breaking Bad on Netflix, and since she found out I'm a fan of the show, we'll talk about it from time to time. She's partway through season 3, and was telling me about how she thought the two Mexican hit men who never talk (can't remember their names) are creepy. I can see that. They're supposed to be.

""Oh my God, when I dropped my son off at day care today, I saw a Mexican guy who looked just like those guys and I thought he was gonna kill me!""

""...Yes, because all Mexican guys are hit men.""

""You don't understand! He was wearing a suit and getting out of a brand new Escalade! Where else would he get the money?""

The wizard's apprentice.,25,ykou5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ykou5/the_wizards_apprentice/,2,1345545011.0,"The following occurs in the same workshop as another story I posted here. But this involves two different workmates: DJ Brazzle Dazzle, and Captain Strugglugs.

DJ Brazzle Dazzle was my supervisor, we were the same age and had similar responsibilities, but he knew his shit. Well respected by the lads, he was still just one of us instead of an office whore.

Captain Strugglugs was one of our apprentices, slow... In movement and wit. The biggest red flag was when our boss described him as, ""Just like me when I was an apprentice"".

Every time we recieve a new PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), the workshop becomes a war zone for about half an hour. They arrive packed in styrofoam strips, that with a little imagination, become all manner of bladed weapons.

DJ Brazzle Dazzle that day, was wearing his +2 Stealth Fancy Pants, and decided to utilise them by hiding around a corner waiting to clobber an unsuspecting leet_hacksaw with his foamy katana. I was hip to his jive though... As I rounded the turn, I assumed my power stance, raising my hand to block the killing strike.

What DJ Brazzle Dazzle failed to compensate for, however, was air resistance. Moments before foam met hand, the weapon collapsed on itself, exploding in a starburst of styrofoam nodules.

Captain Strugglugs had witnessed the entire thing, and, admittedly only for an instant, it appeared to him that I had decimated the weapon using only my mind (again, not real smart). The misty-eyed look of hero worship I received in that moment was hilarious.",2012-08-21 13:30:11

Backstory: I was a waitress, and the back of house guys (BOH) were complete idiots. Not only that, but our manager was a totally nervous kind of guy, always terrified that either a customer would yell at him, or his manager would, or both. 

So, one day, this family comes in: parents, two kids. I go over to take their order, the woman explains to me that her husband and both their kids have a fairly serious milk allergy, and asks that they can have their pizzas with certain toppings, but no milk anywhere near their food. 

I'm quite new to the job at this stage, so I go to the manager and ask him what to do. He gives me the allergy sheet, the family pick the food they want, and my manager tells me to run it as 3 cheese pizzas, and what the wife wants.  I make a point of going into the kitchen afterwards and telling them what they wanted, saying that it will come through as 3 cheese pizzas, but they really want this. I write it on a post-it and stick it on his terminal, for goodness sakes.

So, I go see to other people, it gets kinda busy, and so I am serving another customer when their order comes through. My manager takes it to them. It's 3 cheese pizzas. Just like I expressly told the BOH idiot I did not want. 

Of course, this is all my fault. My manager brings me over to the family's table, who are clearly all right with the mistake, and yells at me in front of them. I was 16 at this stage, this was my first job. I have to admit, he yelled at me so hard I had to stop myself from bursting into tears.

After the horrifying incident, I go to the kitchen to ask what happened, and I see my manager comforting BOH idiot, telling him it wasn't their fault that the order was messed up, and that I wouldn't last long if I kept up this behaviour. I was appalled. I was also 16, and had absolutely no idea how to voice these kinds of concerns. I left about a month after.

I have VERY long hair, and our microwave was right next to the shredder, so I would often turn the shredder off when I was using the microwave so as not to scalp myself. I didn't always remember to turn it back on, but this didn't usually cause a problem. 

This particular day I had been cleaning the microwave, as someone left a huge mess. In the afternoon, one of our higher-ups walks in to shred some papers. She tried to put the paper in the slot, and of course, nothing happened. The conversation went something like this:

**At this point and time I knew that I was dealing with a Rocket Scientist!!!**  If its not obvious, I work at a place that has aircraft (jets/props/helicopters, etc) in plain view of the terminal.

She came inside to the reservation desk, told me that she had hundreds of questions before she rented and told me that she had lived in the town next door to the airport and never knew that our county had a airport.  **She said that she lived there most of her life!!!**

She was cute as a button girl, mid 20's I would say, and on her blouse it said that she was a nurse.  She had to be under 25 because she told me that she is underage for rentals without a fee.

Anyway she had gotten a quote online from one of the Reservation people and wanted to clarify exactly how much it would be to rent a vehicle.  I asked her the reservation number, and she provided a number that I was not familiar with as a reservation number.  The number she had given me was a quote for a car rental, and not a actual reservation number.

Her response to me is that it was a reservation number and needed to confirm it.  I asked her what location the reservation was for, and she told me that she did not ask for a particular location yet, but insisted that she had this reservation.  In a roundabout way I tried to explain her in many different ways that this was not a reservation number, and that the quote could change depending on what location she rented from and was dropping off at.  She did not understand this. 

**As a sidebar I should mention that we are not a corporate location for this particular company and do not have access to the entire reservation system, unless the reservation affects our particular location**

She asked if there was anyone else there that could help her out, and I told her I was the only one working there.  She asked whom the person was in the next booth, and if they could help her because I did not  understand what she was trying to explain to me. I told her it was one of our competitors (Which we get along great with, and help out from time to  time) and if she wished to get a quote from them she was more than welcome.  She said that she preferred our company and said that she had all sorts of coupons, referrals, etc.  I said ok, no problem and explained to her how I could help her.

She wanted to use a debit card and I explained to her that a person using a debit card can have up to a $400.00 additional hold placed on it above the actual rental price.  It is our company policy, and I told her that a normal deposit is $250.00 and at our location they have elected to only add an additional $200.00 instead of the $400.00 hold. So a debit card would have a $450.00 placed on it total.  (The actual hold we could do on her rental was $700.00)


She did not understand this at all and insisted that I was over charging her, and she looked at the paper we had on our counter in regards to debit cards and showed me where it said ""up to an additional $400.00 can be held above the actual rental price""), and told me that I was doing things illegal because I was withholding $450.00 instead of ""$400.00"".  Literally I spent the next 10 minutes explaining to her like she was 5 the basic arithmetic.  

Her basic rental price (before discounts) was around $300.00.  I told her that we are withholding $450.00 and that if the total at the end of the rental was $300.00 then she would get $150.00 placed back into her checking account.  Of course if there were late fees, she didn't fuel the vehicle, etc that $450.00 would be taken out of the ""hold"".

She started to berate me some more, calling me very incompetent among other things.  She said the quote I had quoted her was much different than what she received from the person over the phone, and that I was too dumb to know what I was doing because she had a reservation #.  She also asked me why I did not do a credit background check on her like the person on the phone did.  I told her at least at our location we don't do background checks.  We have your driver license information along with your credit card information.  If you don't pay then we have avenues we can pursue this through the court systems.

I told her that if she gave me her e-mail address I could send her a quote, or make a reservation for our particular location  if she would like.  She told me she had a e-mail address to send it to, but it wouldn't do any good because she doesn't have internet at home.  I asked if she could could use another computer, possibly her work computer to check it (she had a gmail account) and once again berated me because she ""doesn't have internet access"" and was infuriated that I didn't understand that she couldn't access the internet.

I asked her to contact the reservation number again and confirm the information with the agents there because at this point and time I was about to bang my head against the wall, and was literally beet red from trying not to laugh and keep my composure.  

Meanwhile the other Rental company agent was over at her desk literally having a belly laugh while listening to all this going on and couldn't even look at me with a straight face.  She also stated that she has never dealt with someone that was so stupid.  And the girl in question.. Well I hope I never run into her at the hosptial......

(This is long and I left out some of the other details, as my dealing with this person went on for at least 45 minutes).  I finally walked out of the airport terminal and went outside because I couldn't deal with her anymore.",2012-08-17 05:04:21
A shitty prank becomes all too literal.,73,yauns,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/yauns/a_shitty_prank_becomes_all_too_literal/,9,1345087868.0,"There are two guys I work with, who for the sake of anonymity will be referred to as: Scrooge McFuck, and The Muffin-Top Madness. The following occurs in an electrical workshop I worked in 2 years previous.

Scrooge McFuck is an older gentleman, bred Old Navy, part time handyman, part time Maritime endorsed shark hunter, full time storyteller. The most interesting man I have ever met. Has a hundred stories that, if I heard them from anyone else, I would call bullshit, but from Scrooge McFuck, 100% legitimate.

The Muffin-Top Madness is your standard workshop clown. Utterly hilarious, until you were the target. A god of the minor inconvenience, each major prank a masterpiece of workshop warfare.

One of The Muffin-Top Madness's less creative, but more frequent ideas, was Toilet Terror. Our toilets were a single door set-up, one toilet. Randomly, when someone was in there, The Muffin-Top Madness would throw an 8mm bolt at the door. The noise inside was akin to Cthulu's bellowing orgasm. The 8mm limit was imposed after a 16mm bolt penetrated the hollow-core door, narrowly missing an apprentice. There was so much urine... Everywhere.

Now, Scrooge McFuck had a few quirks, as is to be expected from a life experience such as his. One of these is putting the entirety of what he packed for lunch on the one sandwich, stating ""it all goes to the same place anyway"", as he scoffs down a meat pie and cake extravaganza. Another is that he leaves his shits to the absolute last minute, desperately sprinting to the toilet before he soils himself.

One fateful day, Scrooge McFuck hammered past me, in the middle of removing his pants. Immediately after he closes the toilet door, a bolt whistles past my head and impacts against the door with the force of a... bolt hitting a door really hard. There was a crash, quickly followed by a scream. Scrooge McFuck had fallen over, breaking the toilet and shitting everywhere.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is the reason that I caught glimpses of an old man shitting, every day for over a year, because he refused to shit with the door closed ever again.

ok so i see jay giggling around liv and her embarassed, i assume she's doing the normal slutty shit ,but no, today is different.

you see, three days ago she came to work work after her shift dressed in shorty shorts and hooker boots, with tony from seafood in tow, and is flirting with jason from the deli as well. she didnt succeed with jason, but held on to tony for a movie night that ended with fucking in her mother's bed. she then needed to call her boyfriend tyler and after som tears they broke up.

how do i know? she was recounting these events to jay in great detail, and then asked both of us not to tell anyone. i just rolled my eyes and turned back to my work, but she wouldnt let it go. ""Well, im not a slut!"" she calls to me across the store. ""Well yes you are"" I say, and she gets pissy with me. I have to ask ""Why the fuck would you tell us this? If i was caught sucking a coworker's dick in my mamma's bed, that would be my little secret."" she dodges the question, and begins talking to jay about how she never wears panties.

Later she is talking to Jay and pointing to me. Laughing, Jay shouts ""Hey John? are you upset with Liv? yall have any kind of history?"" ""Yeah,"" she says ""If i've done anything to offend you i will apologize"". My response ""No, you can suck as much dick as you want, it wont bother me."" scares her off for a while.

then jay and i start to talk about how relationships can end so suddenly, because he had dated a girl for twelve years, but she got to wondering what other guys would be like and cheated on him. i tell him i dont ever want to expiriment with other people, and neither does my girlfriend. I like the security of being in a relationship and not having to worry about finding girls and rebuilding relationships. Liv rushes over and says """"yeah! you dont have to be such a douche about it all, and as if you could get another girl. im surprised you got this one."" i tell her "" you know you can make whatver jokes you want about me, i dont have to make fun of you, and i dont have to worry about my girlfriend cheating."" She leaves ashamed. Jay and i are able to resume our conversation, and agree that it takes a certain kind of person to enter a long term relationship, and both people will be tempted. you just have to know that at the end of the day you go home to her, and she comes home to you.

later in the night i point out to liv that she was in fact wearing panties yesterday, as i remember she was wearing ""those slutty yoga pants that are two sizes too small"". she is paralyzed with embarassment. aparently she'll shamelessly fuck any of our coworkers and tell the few of us who dont participate all about it, but panty lines are beyond the pale.

TL;DR - coworker ""not a slut"", but she cannot get dicks into her body fast enough and will tell us all about it. i even tried to stop her, but that only made it worse.

car washing analogy for my terrible co-worker (programmers),20,u1vx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/u1vx5/car_washing_analogy_for_my_terrible_coworker/,7,1337817937.0,"Derp is a terrible programmer, perhaps back in the good old days of using fortran for the Russian army his fortran skills looked pretty good but today we call this skill ""math"" and we no longer use pencils and paper. For whatever reason Derp has been thrown back into the workforce and has somehow found his way to my company. His unwillingness to take advice from co-workes is his major downfall. The following is a description of his development process using a automated car wash as an analogy.

Derp shows up at a car wash. His goal is to wash a car, so he somehow found his way here. I mention this because this will be his only correct step. Derp immediately pulls past the teller machine and directly into the washing area; disregarding any the directions telling the driver not to drive forward. The casual observer will note that the machine may not actually function at this point. Next he exits the vehicle leaving the door open as he walks to the teller machine. He identifies and immediately presses the Start button - nothing happens. He presses this button again and another button called ""Stop"". No results so he presses the buttons many more times each time harder and hard. Still nothing. Next he sees a coin slot. A quick chuckle insues. ""Ha ha, I should have expected this Microsoft car wash to be greedy."" He reaches for a penny from his coat pocket and turns to his fellow co-worker and asks ""How long should the card be washed before it would be clean?""

Puzzled the co-work explains, ""it doesn't work like that, you have to pay $6.00 and you have to use the tokens provided from that machine over there. First you pay then you press the...""

Derp interrupts, ""I know what I am doing! I am just trying to determine the length of the car wash so as to ascertain the quality of the wash given by this machine. Architecture is very important and not to be looked over!"". Derp scoffs at inexperienced the co-worker. ""So you think about 1 hour?"".

The co-worker tries again, ""It doesn't work like that, there are different sets of washes, cheap, extra soap, with or without wax. Length of time really isn't considered."".

""Ha ha, yes they are very greedy aren't they"". No matter. Derp proceeds pour pennys into the coin slot, coin after coin all get rejected. And start to jam the coin return slot. After this he tries dimes, quaters, ""Damn Microsoft, you'd think they know what they are doing by now!"". Finally - perhaps when no one is looking Derp makes a trip to to the token exchange machine and returns with a token.

This time Derp confidently presses the start button, inserts his token, and strolls to his car and waits for the wash to begin. After some time he falls asleep (Microsoft is very slow you know). After a few hours Derp wakes up to find that his car is still dirty. ""Damn this microsoft crap! You would think they could make a simple automatic car wash!"". With no other choice Derp decides to rebuild/fix the car wash himself. Derp exits the vehicle and finds a hose. He connects one end to a spout near the car entrance. He walks over to the car but stops short when the length of the hose is found to be too short. He jokes with the co-workers, ""This greedy company - give us a hose that is exactly long enough to run from their spout to their machine, but not long enough to wash the car with!"" In Derp's mind he has already found many reasons to abandon this Microsoft car wash, unfortunately he cannot even name a single other car washing company so he is stuck with this one. Derp proceeds to disconnect every hose that he can find. Basically dismantles the entire facility one piece at a time. He then fastens the hoses together using duck tape whenever needed. Taking a break from his duct taping sessions he has a quick chat with a fellow co-worker. ""Do you know, that the cheap 3 dollar duct tape works better and far more reliably than using microsoft's own hose connectors? In fact many of their hoses are difference sizes and are not even compatible with each other! How can such a company exist?!""

The co-worker caught is dumbfounded, having a vague idea that Derp has been assigned the quick task of ""use the automated car wash to was a car"" he cannot fathom what Derp is doing with a dismantled car wash parts all around him. The co-worker suggests ""You know they have an automatic car wash that does all...""

""No no, I don't have time to learn about another company's car wash. I do not perfer Microsoft to Linux but this is what I have to work with. Besides I just got this one working."" (Holds up tangle hoses). ""Although next time I may choose to never use another microsoft product in my life.""

Co-worker: ""..uhh, this other car wash is Microsoft. I mean the one you are using. They have an automatic car washing machine now-a-days which makes washing a car very easy...""

Derp: ""Believe me I've taken a look at their automated car wash machine, and I know what I'm saying when I say that 'It doesn't work.'.""

By some stroke of luck Derp manages to get a set of tubing together. Being made of duct tape it has a 5 minutes life span before more repair in necessary. The tubes will provide water to about 10% of the car. And in order to wash the entire car Derp has to move the car multiple times. Finding soap however was a quick win, after dismantling every piece of the car wash facility Derp has found more than $6 dollars worth of soap, or something like soap and chooses to use it all. 

Now Derp is in a situation where the car is still dirty, covered in soap, needs to simultaneously move the car and spray water on it, not to mention scrub the car it himself.  So what's a person to do? **Now is the first time Derp is willing to call for the help of his co-workers**. He's got the framework laid out. (You three go create hoses, you two repair the hoses as they fall apart, you scrub the car, meanwhile Derp will pull drive the car in circles.) 

Derp proclaims the job is done. And gives a word of advice, the problem is not so much putting the soap on but getting all of the soap off!

Too important to get out of his car,25,uf78w,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/uf78w/too_important_to_get_out_of_his_car/,4,1338528414.0,"I work as a lowly bank teller at a small community bank.  Like many customer service related jobs, I get my fair share if irrational customers.  One might argue people get even more irrational with tellers as we are dealing with money here, but I digress.  

Today's story focuses on a charming fellow who pulled up to our drive-up, he asks for a deposit slip, fills it out and half-heartedly tosses the check and deposit slip into our motorized tray (the little box do-hickey that you see in bank drive up lanes).  I reach in to grab his deposit and notice there is no check to be found.  ""Sir, did you still have that check? I can't seem to find it."" I say.

""No, I put it in the tray.  I watched it go in.""  He replies.

These motorized trays have a lot of panels, moving parts and compartment space.  My first thought is that the check is somewhere inside the empty space under the tray.  So another teller and I dismantle the tray looking for this guy's check all the while he's getting  more and more impatient, swearing up and down he put the check in the tray.  Once we've confirmed that the check is nowhere to be found inside the tray I begin looking outside our teller window to see if I can spot the check on the ground in our drive-up.  I notice it instantly.  ""Sir, I think that's your check on the ground there.""

""Impossible, I saw it go into the tray.""  He responds.

""Could I ask you to check and make sure that isn't your check?"" I ask.

""Am I going to need to call your manager?"" he growls back. Irate, he continues to threaten the other teller while I step away from the window, go outside the bank, walk up to his car where I spotted the check, pick it up, hand it to him and ask ""Is this your check?""

Flustered, he acknowledges it is his check.  I take the check from him, walk back into the back to my computer, run the deposit and send him his receipt. ""Here's your receipt.  Have a nice day.""  I tell him.

His only reply: ""The wind must have blown the check out of the tray before you pulled it in.""  He then drives off.

There was no wind.",2012-06-01 08:26:54

Now, for some background, I work for a company that manufactures a certain type of transmitter equipment. The transmitter itself is not important. What is important is that our product is multiple pieces of hardware controlled by our software. It only controls some types of hardware and not others.

Anyhow, I get a call from SomeTVCompany and he tells me they have the standard system with a ""BAR Encoder"" underneath the usual gear. No one has told them how this works. No one has told them how to connect anything. No one has given them any instructions. Hell, No one has even told us this has happened. I dispatch a tech.

So, follow up later in the day. Ticket gets logged. This system was manufactured the proceeding week. The day before the rental goes out, they discover they're missing a piece of the FOO encoder and can't actually make the system work. ""No problem, we'll put in BAR"", they say to themselves rather smugly thinking they have solved the problem.

Except, our software doesn't know how to control the BAR. It knows how to control FOO. Making the system FUBAR.

We had to spend 30 minutes trying to explain to him that CRA(Canada Revenue Agency) was working on the 2011 tax returns, so previous years  are set aside. He kept yelling that he was going to sue us because we were refusing to give him his money, which isn't ours to give in the first place.

Client #2:
Dropped off her tax papers to get her personal and small business returns completed along with her husband's personal return. Usually there is a back-log of dropped-off returns, but this particular time there wasn't. She had dropped it off March 24, and it was completed on March 25th. We called her to come sign the papers on March 25th. She came in March 29th, signed and paid. It was the eFiled, the same day. A week or two later she called to make sure that everything was done and it was submitted, because she hadn't received her refund yet. I told her that it was, and that CRA received it on the 29th. She the flipped out demanding to know why it had taken so long to get done. I was speachless. Her actual words were ""I was in WEEKS ago, and why was it only filed last week!"" She then proceeded to complain about the service she received, and stated multiple times about how unhappy she was.  Keep in mind it takes CRA at least 10 business days to send a refund. It had only been 4 business days when she called because of the Easter weekend.

Client #3, well more like multiple clients:
The Ontario government has changed how the process refunds from deductible rent. How it was last year was that any amount of you rent that was refunded to you, was put on your lump-sum income tax return. They introduced the 'Trillium Benefit' this year that changes that. Starting this year, any refund from your rent is no longer applied to your lump-sum refund, but is instead spread out through the year, in monthly cheques. The amount you get is the exact same as you would get if it was included on your income tax refund.

A large number of our clients are in lower income brackets, or are elderly, so a lot of them only got a refund because they could get their rent refunds on the income tax refund. But now, a large portion of them no longer are getting an income tax refund, and refuse to listen to our explanations about the Trillium Benefit. A lot of them have decided not to even files their taxes because of it. We try and explain that you actually need to file your return to qualify for the Trillium Benefit. So not only are we losing clients, some aren't even filing.",2012-04-24 03:14:40

My life in a nutshell,28,ro41r,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/ro41r/my_life_in_a_nutshell/,13,1333298766.0,"I have worked in customer service for almost 6 years. I began working full time when I was 14 (while still going to school). I am nearly 20 years old now and have accumulated more weird, disgusting, outright ridiculous things than I ever thought possible. 

* Backstory: My mom is hawt. Like still gets ID'ed when her an I go out for beers together (legal drinking age here is 19). My mother also happens to own the two gas stations I work at (and manage). She recently left on a three week vacation leaving me to run both her stores and continue working at my third job. There's a regular that comes into my gas station all the time and after seeing me there every morning he commented and asked where my mom was. I told him she was on vacation leaving me in charge. He responded with ""She'd better give you a nice big bonus when she comes back or I'm going to have to bend her over me knee and give her a spanking""
-After she came back home he tried to follow her out of the store in a joking manner saying ""I'm gonna see if you're ticklish"" to which my mother responded ""Actually, you're not going to fucking touch me"" Haven't seen him since-
* I get asked my creepy old men all the time for a Lotto SEX 49, with creepy winking. (Instead of 6/49)
* A man asked me once for a Western 6/49 lottery ticket with 4 boards and an extra (it's a Canadian thing) but he wanted the ticket to be $3.00. This is not physically possible. Each board costs $1.00 and the extras is another dollar. You do the math. That's $5.00. While explaining to this man that I can't actually do this, my cell phone rings. Now I am usually very good about not answering my phone while dealing with a customer but this was a phone call from the other store I was managing so I answered and asked them to wait. So I have my phone propped on my shoulder, still trying to explain to this man that his lottery ticket will cost $5.00 when he says ""maybe if you weren't on the fucking phone, you would have some fucking idea what I'm talking about, you stupid bitch""
* A man pumped his gas and the total came to $40.01. He comes in to the store and my cashier goes ""Good afternoon sir, you had the $40.01 on pump number 3?"" (Standard greeting) He responds with ""Yes but I'm not paying that one cent. I have complained about this before!"" He goes off on a big tirade about how our pumps never stop right on the dollar and that it ""jumps"" three cents and how the stupid manager at ""this stupid fucking place"" needs to call someone to fix it, or risk losing a customer. I jump in and say, as sweetly as possible ""Good afternoon sir, My name is DFTBAwesome and I am the manager here at Canadian Tire Gas Bar."" He turns to me and says ""no you're fucking not. You're too young to be smart enough to manage"" Basically we argued until I finally told him to just leave the $40.00 and I would pay the ONE FUCKING CENT out of my own pocket. I made sure to wish him a wonderful day before he left. 
* Our garbage bins outside are only authorized for the use of our store. We can actually charge people for throwing garbage in our bins. So this guy pulls his truck up one day and starts throwing garbage in to our bins. So my mother (who as previously stated) owns the gas station, walks outside and politely tells the man he is disposing his garbage on private property and that only the owner can authorize dumping in these bins. He rounds on her, red-faced and yells ""Well I AM the fucking owner of this place so you can just fuck right off"". I don't know exactly what happened but he left in a hurry. 
* I work at a Canadian Tire Gas Station. We give out 3 cents per liter back in Canadian Tire Money on every fuel purchase. We do not however, accept Canadian Tire Money as payment at our store. ONLY the retail stores do. Usually about once a week I have someone try and pay me in CTM. And nearly every time I get told I'm new, stupid, fucking retarded, or ""Last time I got to pay with it"" I always manage in the nicest possible way to explain ""Actually, I have been a manager at this store for nearly three years. There is no possible way for ANY of my staff members to accept CTM because our system has no POSSIBLE way to allow it."" They usually leave pretty quickly.

At the end of the night my job while closing was to stock and clean the tables and floors.  I spent probably half an hour mopping and vacuuming the floors.  I even moved everything and cleaned under stuff.   I go get the boss so he could look it over and give me the go ahead for me to go home.  Instead he comes out looks around for one second moves a trash can.  He then proceeds to tell me it looks like shit and I should do it over.  Well I knew the floors looked fucking awesome so when he went back into his office I got a pop and sat around for ten minutes.  After ten minutes I go to his offce and told him I was done, even though I didn't do damn thing.  He comes out looks at it all and says "" Looks a lot better, see that wasn't so hard"".  I played along I just wanted to go home.  The dude was completely full of shit and would always try to pull crap like this. ",2012-04-01 04:46:43
What We Have Here is a Failure to Communicate,30,rluou,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/rluou/what_we_have_here_is_a_failure_to_communicate/,6,1333159460.0,"Another one from the truck stop for you.

We have 14 diesel pumps out back, in 7 islands of 2. Each island has an intercom so we can talk back and forth with the truckers. A trucker will hit their button outside which starts our inside box beeping and we'll communicate with them. For regulars, we usually just ask what pump they're using and turn it on. For people we don't recognize, we'll need to take some information like their company, truck number, and how they're paying. It's supposed to prevent drive-offs, but people could always lie. Anyway, I digress.

A couple months ago I was working the morning shift. It was about 9 or 10 and the back lot was empty. A guy pulls in and beeps in on the intercom. I was gonna turn it on for him, so I say ""Hi, what pump?"" He responds in heavily accented (it sounded Russian-ish if I had to guess) English ""ABC Express, truck 23, paying credit."" I say ""Okay, what pump?"" He says again, a little agitated this time, ""ABC Express, truck 23, paying credit!""

""Ok. What pump?"" Once again, but pretty pissed off this time. ""ABC EXPRESS! TRUCK 23! PAYING CREDIT!"" I'm getting frustrated, so I lean in really close and say ""What! Pump! Are! You! Attempting! To! Use!""

""OH! Uh...18."" 

I turned around and looked into the office to see the assitant manager, who had heard the whole thing, with her head on the desk laughing her ass off.",2012-03-31 05:04:20
Lieutenant Dan,38,rl3vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/rl3vl/lieutenant_dan/,7,1333125404.0,"I use to work at a carpet cleaning company (Stanley Steemer).  The worst customer I have ever had the pleasure of working for, I call him Lieutenant Dan.  Me and my partner pull up to the just like every other job.  We lay down our mat to wipe our feet, and put on our protective shoe coverings on to keep us from dragging dirt in and out of the place.  We ring the door bell, the door opens.

  At first I don't see anybody, but then I looked down.  I see him, a no legged man with a beer in his hand.  ""Who the hell are you"", he says.  Um sir we are here to clean your carpets.  After a little bickering he finally lets us in.  Now the next thing we are suppose to ask him is can you show is around sir.  Only problem is I felt awkward as hell asking him because it was a multi-level house, and he is in a wheel chair.   I ask him anyway.  To my surprise he jumps out of his wheel chair mumbling the whole time.  He walked up the stairs on his hands and showed us the rooms that he wanted cleaned.  Everything was matching up to the order except one room.  The room was huge and over 300 sq/ft ,  company policy was that it had to be counted as 2 rooms.  He throws a hissy fit about that to, but that's understandable a lot of people don't know that. 

  He then wants to add two sofas which isn't a problem for us, it counts as commission add on.   So we get done with the walk through and he wants to know the price.  I think after the sofas he added on it came to $160 or something.  He starts calling us mother fuckers and we are robbing him and stuff.  He said the lady on the phone quoted him $62 dollars for everything.  I tried to explain to him that's impossible the minimum for us to do a job is $92.  He then proceeded to curse us out some more calling me a lair and then proceeded grab another beer.

  Well I'm all about the customer service so I tell him I can have the manager pull the phone call and listen to it, if the lady on the phone really did quote him that price we would clean it for that price.  Our manager pulls the call, and as I suspected the person on the phone never quoted Mr. Dan the $62.  In fact my manager said he couldn't understand a word the guy was saying.  We tell Lieutenant the news, and he then curses us out some more, but eventually decides to lets us clean the rooms.  We then started running lines and vacuum hoses into the house.  Apparently, dude didn't like our lines and jumped out of the wheel chair once again onto the porch and starts moving lines. 

 All of a sudden he stumbles and face plants into the porch.  He's not moving, and I freeze for and start yelling at him to see if he's okay.  He doesn't answer.  All I can think of is this mother fucker just died on me.  I'm getting ready to jump over the rail and grab him, and he miraculously jumps up tells me he's okay, jumps into his wheel chair and proceeds to get another beer.  He stays in the kitchen the rest of the time until we finished cleaning.

  Surprisingly after we got the stuff he wanted done he became super nice started apologizing to us for everything and even added more stuff on at the end off the job which made us a little more money.  He even tipped us.  I don't know what changed in him , but my money is on he drank enough to hit that everyone's my best friend level.  All in all when Lieutenant Dan drinks enough he's a alright guy.

An IT worker TFTJ: Dealing with insane computer administrators.,31,rkfqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/rkfqg/an_it_worker_tftj_dealing_with_insane_computer/,22,1333080505.0,"Sorry all, this uses a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, I hope it makes enough sense to everyone:

This Dilbert comic says it all: http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2007-11-16/

These people are so overly obsessed with security that they can't see the forest for the trees. They have established security policies that fly in the face of common sense. Just a sampling of the BS I have to suffer with because of these people:

I am not able to see the calendar or adjust the clock on my computer, which is 16 minutes behind. That would go against their 'security' policy. I'm 16 minutes late for everything because my all my reminders come late!

They refused to change the clock because 'it's not their job to manage small details like each user's system time'.

I decided to circumvent their stupid policy by going into the BIOS and changing it there. When they found out that I had done so (how?) I was called into a meeting with them where they asserted that I had 'illegally accessed the BIOS'.

I told them they had better report this to VP of IT right away. The stupid jackasses took the bait and actually did. When we all met, I explained to the VP what had happened. He excused me from the room and said ""don't worry about this"".

As I walked away I could hear screaming from the office as he tore them a new asshole.

And that's just one story.

I needed Webmail access for traveling. After multiple arguments with the IT department which eventually ended in another ass-reaming from my VP, they begrudgingly gave me access.

But the lead idiot didn't want me to have access from just anywhere, you know the entire purpose of Webmail.

Regardless of the fact that it uses a secure server, and that there are 3 encrypted logins to reach the final login screen, he proposed that I wouldn't just access the Webmail from any old untrusted connection.

No, every time I was to access the webmail, I would have to phone a special phone number and give him my current IP address so he could put it in the whitelist, a list of trusted IPs. Seriously.

Another ass-reaming from my VP and I can now access anywhere, but do you see why I am getting so frustrated? I feel like I'm dealing with a bunch of 10 year-olds.

Thanks for reading. I'm exhausted.

I will come back in a bit to participate in the threads once I've regained my strength.",2012-03-30 07:08:25
Wrong Station,27,rkegd,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/rkegd/wrong_station/,2,1333078821.0,"I suppose I'll start this off. I work at a truck stop and it seems like lots of weird stuff always happens. We're situated just off a freeway and right next door to another truck stop. The driveways are probably 50 feet apart.

A few years ago, a truck pulls in and gets fuel. There's 2 guys in the truck, one who doesn't say anything and one who is speaking English in a thick Cuban accent. They're inside and I'm trying to run his company's fuel card. It keeps getting denied. Finally I call the company and find out they're not set up to fuel with us, they needed to be at the station next door. Mind you, even though the driveways are close to each other, there are logos and store names everywhere. There's no way you can't know where you're at.

So Cuban and Mute are at the counter and I tell them their card won't work. Cuban says ""What you mean, dis won' work? Dis TA, right?"" I say, ""No, sir. That's next door."" Cuban gets this look of shock on his face and slowly turns to Mute. WHAP! He slaps him in the back of the head. ""UN-PHOCKING BELIEVEABLE, MANG! YOU TAKE US TO DE WRONG SPOT!"" Mute looks hurt and very confused. WHAP! Cuban hits him again. ""UN-PHOCKING BELIEVEABLE! HOW PHOCKING DUMB ARE YOU?!""

I'm trying really hard not to laugh. I could've watched this all night, but instead I interjected ""Sir, do you have another way to pay?"" He ended up putting it on his personal credit card and the two guys left. I watched them walk back to the truck, Mute getting walloped another 3 or 4 times on the way.

TL;DR: Cuban guy fills up at the wrong gas station, beats his co-driver in retaliation. ",2012-03-30 06:40:21

He said it was pre-initiated but he said no. He said he was drunk. Sounds like he had some inhibitions but he also wasn’t too traumatized. He sounded almost boastful.

What I would say is that because they attempted to redeem it within the allotted timeframe, you should make a reasonable effort to accommodate them.  It may be their fault that they waited as long as they did, but they did try to redeem it within the allotted timeframe.  And it's not their fault that you missed their email.

Were I in your position, what I would try to do in order to accommodate them is to offer to provide the guided service in season if they can make one of the remaining two days work, out of season within the next couple of weeks (if that's technically feasible), or offer to book them as early as possible (within the first couple of weeks) at the start of the next season and honor their coupon then, even though it will be expired by that point.

The more prepared you are for your pal's lawyers, the more serious you'll look.  Having a written timeline can help you when you need to refer to it in the retelling.

Comment,1,h64matf,,0,1626962740.0,"There are classes you can take online from NCHM (National Center for Housing Management) to get certified on the difference in leasing aspects.  When I took these classes, they were three 8 hour days, not sure how they work online.  At least the Certified Occupancy Specialist (COS) is required for leasing in Section 8 communities, the Tax Credit Specialist (TCS) is for LIHTC and blended communities.

In my opinion, the main difference as a PM is the HUD inspections.  They're much more strict, so you have to be as well with things like beds blocking even a portion of a window needed for egress in the event of fire. Or trip hazards in units and on sidewalks.  But these are all things that a good manager is looking out for anyway IMO.

My experience is in Virginia, but Section 8 is a Federal program while LIHTC is Federal but administered by the state housing authority, so the basic stuff translates from state to state.  Feel free to PM me if you have questions.",2021-07-22 17:05:40

Comment,2,h635z46,,0,1626925198.0,"Hey, I work in property management, too, and it is never easy to get yelled at by angry residents.  Really sucks that your manager is indifferent to the suffering he is causing by being bad at his job, for you and for the residents. Sometimes it can feel like all we are is toilets for people to shit on because they're determined to be an asshole to someone.  Sorry you had to go through this.

I've worked in market-rate communities, luxury apartments, and settled in affordable housing.  Affordable housing is much more pleasant than any other type of community in my opinion.  There's less selling you have to do as the reduced rent is the main incentive.  You have to do a lot more work to process applications than in conventional, verifying income and assets which isn't necessary in conventional.  

If you're a solid manager and want to stay in this career, you might find it worthwhile to look into a position with an affordable housing community.

2. Start job hunting. Once a place starts cutting pay (for junior people, no less) or missing paychecks, it's rare for things to improve. Never work for free.

All of that shit that just barely passes for acceptable? That makes you uncomfortable? That’s him testing you to see how far he can push your boundaries. 

I’m not sure how old you are (not that it matters) but judging from your seeming inexperience with putting up with creepy men’s shit I’d say you’re relatively young. So here’s the deal:

You have a right to work in a safe environment. 

This work situation is not safe. 

It’s sexual harassment. 

Any company will want to put a stop to his behavior because quite frankly, you have grounds for a lawsuit! 

He may be your manager, but he too has a manager. You can go there or you can have a chat with HR. You don’t need video or recorded evidence—in fact depending on your state that could be illegal to record him without consent. 

Your gut instinct exists as an evolutionary survival mechanism. It’s how we as women protect our young and avoid rapists and pillagers. *LISTEN TO YOUR INTUITION!* 

Right now your gut is screaming at you to get help with a potentially dangerous situation. Do not be afraid to ask for help from someone that you trust to guide you in navigating workplace sexual harassment. This is serious. 

Please don’t laugh this off. Please don’t write it off as your own shortcomings from reading things wrong. You’re reading everything right! Just, when you fail to assert yourself or accost him, he knows he can push the boundaries a little more next time. 

How far are you willing to let him push your boundaries before you’re literally being assaulted by this human trash bag? 

I care enough about you to call HR myself if you need me to. I think you’re in real danger. Please end this and end this now!",2021-05-18 04:01:48

The one time I let my guard down years ago I became friendly with someone and was invited to her place to hang out.  She greeted me wearing only panties and a big t-shirt.. While we did end up hanging out for a few hours we both already established our thoughts about that kind of stuff in passing conversations about each other by that point both of us being pretty open minded.   She ended up asking me if I wanted to hook up before I left for the night but luckily she fully understood my position and we continued a good relationship without any awkwardness but I'm fairly certain I just won the lottery on those results.  

One part of my brain feels like it does hate me for certain choices in life but other parts reflect upon those choices I've made with happiness.

This is called hoteling and it’s going to become extremely common for hybrid remote companies. Eventually your company is going to want to downsize it’s real estate given the hybrid model, and when they happens there won’t be enough seats for everyone at once. 

Hence you’ll need to reserve seats as a way to manage capacity.

Comment,11,gu8tabw,,0,1618228219.0,"This is not how hotelling is supposed to work.  Hotelling is supposed to accommodate telework, so people's permanent desks are at home.  The hotel space works like a hotel: you stay there temporarily.  If you need to come into the office for a meeting, then you come in for a day.  You have collaborative space for team meetings and workspace, like a conference room at a hotel or a study room in college.

Making people hotel 100% of the time is torture.  You have to come in, but you have no real space.  You cannot keep anything personal at work, cannot store snacks, and have no real space to call your own.  It encourages cliques, and makes you feel like a permanent temp worker.

The open office space is just torture for introverts and is very detrimental to people whose jobs require more thinking and less talking.  It's awful to have to drown out your neighbor's phone calls, and even worse if you are trying to make a phone call and have to block out other office noise.

Comment,18,gs35hs3,,0,1616615422.0,"I’m an on-site apartment manager and I totally know how you feel.  I think the bottom line with this kind of job is that the less they hear from you, the better they think you are doing.  Not only do my bosses not need to know what is going on on my property, for the most part I don’t think they want to.  There are some weeks where I’m not doing much work but even then they are still paying me just to be around in case of emergencies, so I guess that somewhat justifies my existence (I also have another job).

As far as advice, I keep very detailed records even though they told me on day one that I don’t need to keep a list and that I’d only be fired if nothing was getting done at all.  I also try to have a few projects that I can mention off of the top of my head just in case they do call to see how things are going (which only happens every few weeks anyway) and I make sure to space out reimbursement requests and contractor visits so that they know stuff is getting done when the bills come in.  I don’t know if you do any landscaping or if it’s just the leasing side of things, but I personally mow the grass so I try to be right on top of that in case they make a surprise visit to the property.  I’m pretty sure the only reason they keep telling me everything looks so great is because the front lawn is always freshly cut when they come out here.  Aside from that I google everything I don’t know how to do and I do everything in my power NOT to call my bosses.  It took a little getting used to but now that I have a better feel for the way they operate this has become one of the better jobs that I have had in my life (just don’t get me started on the tenants).

I would have to get out of the busy trailer and clear the ramp for the less busy, and then I would have to hustle back to the other when the picker called out that his ramp was almost full.

My dad asked me why I was the one doing it, and I said that I was the only one with enough hustle to get it done each day without overtime. He dropped an important phrase that day: ""don't do a shitty job well my boy!""

No cops ever called though which you would think would be the normal thing to do.

Turns out they store was making us work for nearly an hour and a half after the store closed but only paying us for the hours the store was actually open instead of the hours each employee worked. HUGE LAWSUIT and state labor violation fines. The accused employees were those who honestly answered the labor investigator's questions about overtime, timekeeping irregularities, etc.\*

\*The store also would pull the time cards on Saturday - the busiest day of the week when the most employees were on staff - at 7 pm when the store closed at 10.  At a minimum it cheated employees out of 3 hours of pay but more often than not the employees got NO PAY AT ALL for Saturdays ""because you never clocked out"" (how could I when my timecard had already been taken by accounting?)

The frustrating part is that the manager position I was expecting was literally taken away -- as in, the position was abolished, so I was reporting up two levels higher than what was normal.  I had been strung along for at least a couple of years.  I was biding my time.

Then the Associate Director and Director directly above me both put in their notice and left.  A job opportunity came up that was (on paper) exactly what I was currently doing.  I wasn't looking to leave, I didn't think I needed to, I didn't' even think I *wanted* to...But I applied for the new job and I left.  It was the best decision I have made to date work-wise.  For one thing, my salary went up by 50%, I now get yearly bonuses, yearly raises, and overall less stress. For the same basic work. 

My new company is fantastic and has been truly great during this pandemic.  I enjoyed the years I spent at the university, and I got opportunities there I would have never gotten elsewhere (started off in the helpdesk, went up to helpdesk manager, then started doing development work on the ticketing system -- now I'm a full time software developer).

I get told that I am going to start to get called in on smaller escalations when he is busy, but they then send someone else because they are closer. 

The main differences are that i am getting raises frequently, and anywhere else in my industry is definitely going to be less pay, and freedom due to proprietary equipment knowledge.

 You are getting screwed. If you have the skills of a senior developer you should be looking for those positions and applying since sometimes the only way to move up is leaving.",2020-12-29 19:46:19

Every hour of PTO that you lose because you’re maxed out is essentially an hour that you’re working for free. Never do free work unless it’s for charity. If they’re relying on that free work to get things done, then it’s their fault if not everything gets done.

Comment,11,ghbq2c1,,0,1609189979.0,"Oh, and regarding the PTO. Up until a few months ago, I've purposely not been taking time off to rack up PTO. As they will have to pay it out when I leave.

However, now that's it has maxed out, and is wasting away...that's just due to my workload. I have such an intense workload, that there is no incentive to take a day off. If I take a day off, I'm now a day behind on my work. There is no one else to step in and take over my work while I'm gone.

So, unfortunately, my only incentive to take time off, is to come back to more work and shorter deadlines.

And this is not just a problem for me. Many others on my team have expressed they're unhappy with the massive workloads we have, and corporates refusal to hire more help.",2020-12-28 23:12:59
Comment,14,ghbpv0p,,0,1609189872.0,"Well, to be honest, there is a bit of a double edged sword here. When they closed the office, and offered for us to stay, they also gave us a retention bonus. So as long as we don't quit, we get a lump sum at the end of 2020. So I've been using this year to bulk up on my development skills, and add new things to my resume.

So that's been the main reason why I didn't simply leave a year ago.

As far as incentive...obviously you're right, logically if they don't have to do something, they won't. My non-logical answer is...if they valued me enough to lay off every person in the building, laying off half the entire company, but felt I was essential enough to keep me...then the threat of me leaving from being unhappy I would think is incentive to keep me happy. And I've made it clear to them on multiple occasions that I want this promotion, and I keep being told no.

Now, upper management may not realize how much I really do, but my supervisor does. And I do know for a fact that when I leave, it will hurt.

Unfortunately, this is what happened to me at my last company. I gave them way too many chances, making it clear I wasn't happy with my position....they ignored it. Finally I accepted an offer from another company willing to pay me what I was worth and I told my company I was putting in my 2 weeks notice, and had no intentions of accepting any counter-offers. Their jaws literally dropped (not just using it as an expression). They made multiple counter offers, even better than the one I had. And I had to say no, because I knew, 2-3 years from then, I'd be right back in that same position.",2020-12-28 23:11:12
Comment,6,ghbplh2,,0,1609189732.0,"I worked for a company that decided to give EVERYBODY 1% across the board - good or bad - because it was just easier to blanket raise all 65 employees with the same amount. Never mind that some got awards from the customer and deserved HUGE raises and other sucked so bad they should have been fired. That was a total insult to those of us who went above and beyond.  Many threats to quit when the notices came out. 
 This was a very lucrative government contract and the customer liked the work and specific staff and couldnt really afford to lose folks just before contract renewal time. Fortunately, we had an AWESOME VP who wouldnt approve it.  The rock stars not only got much bigger raises but bonus checks.

Comment,7,ghbovma,,0,1609189358.0,"I do agree with you that the norm/average raise is 3-7%, there isn't much arguing that.

The reason my 3% raise bothered me is because, despite having an excellent performance review, I still ended up getting the legal bare minimum. Which means that even if I had a terrible review, aside from firing me, they still would have given me 3%, because they were legally required to.

As far as my job, I 100% LOVE what I do. I don't spend all this time and money to read books, take courses, etc, to help them, I do it because I love it, and I love learning more. I just wish my company placed more value in their employees continued education.

My anger stems from the fact that I really love what I do, and up until recently, I've really loved working for this company. So to be shoved in the corner for so many years like they've been doing, really makes me upset, because I'm being forced to leave a company I've enjoyed working for. And I'm upset, because I've worked so hard to get where I am, yet even though I am just as qualified as my peers, I have a lower title, lower pay, but same responsibilities and experience.

Unfortunately, there are no other positions or departments within the company for me to work for. This is it.

What incentive does the company have to give you more money?

They are in it for themselves. Whether you stay or leave, you should at least use your PTO. Why DIDNT You use it for your class time? Especially since it’s maxed out? What are you trying to prove?

If I was you — and I am not, and I do not work in software development nor do I know anything about it — but I think I’d start PTO taking days off, and applying for other work.  Ideally at a company that appreciates and rewards employees. They do exist. 

But that’s me. You might not have the same tolerance for risk or change, and that’s honestly ok. But don’t expect more money in that case. And that can be ok too. It’s your life. Live it the way you want.",2020-12-28 23:02:25

Comment,13,gg6k5po,,0,1608239966.0,">Please note, looking where to share this story as I feel my company should be held accountable for their poor behavior.    I originally posted this on glass-door.  The review was up for three weeks until it somehow disappeared.  I worked in the semiconductor industry for Lam Research in America.   At the onset of China's COVID-19 outbreak, in mid-January 2020, I was given 24 hours notice to travel to China for a customer escalation.  US news had not yet reported the virus.  I was not made aware of a viral outbreak until I arrived in China as all of the Chinese-based Lam employees knew about it.  While there, I was not told any preventative measures and not supplied any safety equipment except given a face mask, when I requested one, for my trip back to America.

&nbsp;

> Once I left China after fulfilling my obligation to my manager to stay a week -- as well as for safety reasons -- management told me I should still be in China regardless of the outbreak.  This was despite management's promise to handle the escalation in China after I left.  Management, however, decided to spin the story to our VP that I'd stay longer and that me leaving was a sign that I'm not committed to the customer or the business.  It gets worse.  I was told not to quarantine despite asking and, a week after my return, two close coworkers displayed COVID-19-like symptoms and both were out for over a week.

&nbsp;

> HR is ineffective in these matters by stating management shouldn't have asked me to stay in China yet the managers responsible for this harmful decision still manage people.  HR has further stated no one could have known the severity of this virus citing ""a 2015 Ebola scare that didn't amount to much"" yet neglect -- and refuse to discuss -- previous outbreaks such as SARS and H1N1.  Additionally, HR said that my co-workers potentially catching the virus is pure speculation since there was no official COVID-19 test.  These events happened in early Feb 2020 before we had any COVID-19 tests or started our lock downs.  This seems outright negligent and irresponsible!

&nbsp;

> Important lessons can be learned that seem to be ignored.

Comment,1,ge72v80,,0,1606775679.0,"I agree with this perspective in a way.

What does it take for OP to move up to being a driver and why do you have to wait at most a year?

Also, to OP, do your work and don’t pick up on the slack of others. What I mean to say by this is, don’t rush through your own stuff to get to the crap left behind by your coworkers. The pay stays the same regardless of effort. You know what I mean? You are not getting paid any more or any less if you go out of your way and above and beyond ..or barley getting by your own workload.
This seems like an odd way to put it, but one weakness is letting the company know what is actually your strength, in this case, your work integrity and ability to keep up with your own and pick up after your coworkers.
I hope the union has your back on this matter, but they could also see you as a way for them to save money bc they know you’re going to go above and beyond to do YOUR part plus pick up the slack.

Get yourself some workers comp. like another user here said, your back is your life. It really is. That’s not something to be fucked with. Please get some rest, and seek out some well deserved Justice for your self.

I've worked for a bunch of crappy places with serious lack of management. Another red flag is how often they promote new employees.

Example. My cousin needed a loan for a mortgage approval. My grandpa sent a check to help. The loan company requested a screen shot of the transaction from my grandpas checking account.

Comment,5,g9x6g37,,0,1603554333.0,"The head psychiatrist I used to work with was the same way.   I'd start to tell him ""Hey.   I was talking with patient John Doe and he's really upset about his wife leaving.   He said"" 

And that's as far as I got before he held up his hand in the *stop* position and said *thank you, Ms Ethyl"" and walked off.

It taught me to cut to the chase in one well formed sentence that I mentally rehearsed as I was walking towards him.

""Patient John Doe is expressing suicidal thoughts due to his upcoming divorce.""  

That got my main point across and left room for questions if he had any.  He'd usually give me instructions and walk on.

I also made certain to take a deep breath before talking with him.  Pausing in the middle of my sentence to take a breath gave him a chance to cut me off.  He wasn't mean, just busy.  

Try that.   Deep breath and ""President only needs the light assemblies and requested I leave mounting screws here.""  Don't stop until it's out.   Then she can ask questions.

I once had a job with a large organization that pretty much everyone would recognize with a good reputation.   But it turned out to be very political with an ancient management style.  So I started looking.  One interviewer asked why are you leaving?  I told him a polite version of why.  I still love his response.

It sounded to me that this seemed more like someone else probably changing the schedule, claiming that it was cleared already, or some other tampering. It happens. Nobody really documents both employees agreeing unless you use an online program for scheduling, which does help these issues.

Comment,11,g5n6m55,,0,1600382511.0," I'm not sure if this post really fits here, not that I could tell you where is better.

But you have some legal points that might be worth consulting a lawyer, doing some searching for appropriate government bodies, or at least throw it up on /r/legaladvice to ask for where to start.

Being fired for complaining about workplace harassment is not ok.

Edit: also, you should remove the names from the post/not name them in the title. Most subreddits have a rule against it, and it's generally unwise when airing so much dirty laundry (so to speak).",2020-09-18 01:41:51

When my sister took some Red Cross training to help with old folks homes during this fun year, one of the first things she was told is ""learn how to say no"".

You're not a slave - you're a caregiver and cleaner. I bet there are other folks you could give slightly better care and cleaning to if you decline these other requests. The people who don't complain/demand could have better service instead.

So, if a client treats you like this, I think it is very disrespectful. You do not deserve a treatment like this.

On top of it, she puts a lot of work on you which has nothing to do with caregiving. I don’t know anything about the laws or rules what is part of your job and what is not, but I feel that no matter if you are into this yard sale thing or not, it‘s not your job. To me her behavior seems abusive beause she is earning money whith it but expects you doing a job on top of your normal job without paying you. If she needs someone who does the yard selling thing, she needs to hire someone extra for this job.",2020-09-06 09:52:29

Comment,2,g2rtlfo,,0,1598332774.0,"I almost died in a shit hole paper mill in white pigeon Michigan. I can say that an operational paper mill is not much clearer than the one you described. when I first walked into the place it was around 110°F. the ceiling was black and dripping from condensation. wasn't too long and I figured out it was black mold on a wood ceiling. I took a good look around and thought, ""this is what it must be like doing concrete formwork in hell. this paper mill  was for recycling cardboard. a type of acid is used to break down the cardboard. as soon as it passes through the first series of machines it's getting misted with acid. we were there to replace a concrete floor with a basement underneath it. the years of black mold condensation ate through the concrete and has been eating up the reinforcement bars. long story shorter. when it was time to strip the under deck formwork, that's when it happened. this pussy of a carpenter asked me to come help. what I heard was, ""hey Steve, you want to (come over here and do this for me) give me a hand. so I went to where he was up in some scaffolding. I was on a mechanical pad a couple feet off the ground no big deal. I had my hands on a 16""x8' syomns form with a steel frame. it was stacked on a 16"" x4' form. it was locked in from the deck pour(cast). he had a 4' L bar and popped the top of the form out. little did I know there was a steel conduit up there. some of the wires had a short in then and metal is an excellent conductor for electricity. as soon as the form hit the conduit, I was thrown off the pad bounced off a couple braces and landed on my back. I didn't even have time to know what the hell hit me. then thev4' L bar landed long ways across my forehead. you could say I avoided death twice that day. the electricity running through was 480 volts. had the K bar landed upright on my forehead it would have split my dome open. after the dust settled I asked if he got zapped to, because he dropped the bar on me. he replied, you're going to love this, I got scared and dropped it. you'd think the union company, I'm not going to name any names grand river construction, would have took me to the hospital or anything. superintendent dusted my back off and said go you a cig and let me know how you feel. at least I wasn't this guy. there was a man welding and the concrete was set up enough to get on to work. he was putting handrail around the pulper machine. no one knew where he was and thought he drug up, left the job site.  he fell into the pulper car.",2020-08-25 08:19:34

But if I want to do this for real and make a living at it, I either have to play their game, or I have to start with a giant pile of money, print a pile of my own books, and hope I can market them. If I were independently wealthy, sure, I'd take the shot. But after 25 years of working in education and now starting over from scratch, this is the path ahead of me. So, I ride the bear and work my ass off. It'll get better as my audience grows and I build a body of work and a reputation.

**Donna:** Oh, I'm just letting you know. Actually it's both our jobs to clean those y'know?

**Me:**  Yes, it is both our jobs to clean them.

**Donna:**  Okay, just making sure you know!

The audacity of her telling me to clean something I know she never cleans -while I am fixing something she isn't even capable of fixing- kinda got to me. So I stopped cleaning those screens entirely. When an auditor cited dirty screens as a finding and my boss asked if I was still cleaning those I related that Donna story to him.

Comment,6,fv1lo03,,0,1592334994.0,"**Part 4 - My new job is FUCK DONNA**

The fact that Donna was doing 0% of her job was not news to me. There's a million different ways you would know. The fact that you will never see her doing her job, the fact that she never orders parts, or checks off inspections for units that have failed and been taken off the ramp (but she wouldn't know that.) Apparently supervisors also had GPS tracking and unknown to me she had been caught repeatedly where she very clearly signed off every inspection while not even at the airport. Plenty of people will bullshit on occasion, but there's a difference between a little bullshit and literally not doing your job at all.

I decided the best way to get this woman gone was to get something concrete. A picture showing something clearly wrong on a unit she inspected wasn't going to be concrete in the eyes of management. I decided on spot-checking Donna's work on one of the smaller operations. I would print out all her inspections for that operation, then I would get copies of service tickets from that operation after Donna' shift ended. I would then cross-check her inspections with the tickets. Here we see she got the readings for unit before that unit had been used that morning. Here we see she got the readings, but not within an hour of any time that unit was being used. Here we see she got the readings for three units which in less than a minute when those units are staged very from each other. I submitted these to the safety manager who was appalled and furious.

The next day the safety manager asked me to go check the times on all those units to make sure the times on the tickets were correct. I  verified the times were correct, and also checked Donna's work vs the tickets again. I don't think the safety manager was expecting me to come back with JUST AS MANY documented cases of Donna bullshitting the very next day. I told him I would come back with more, and also asked he keep quiet about it because I wanted enough evidence that this wouldn't get her off with another write-up. The safety manager was (rightfully) too upset about this to keep quiet and reported it to all the management anyways. Donna was, after all, putting peoples lives at risk. 

The 3rd day I come back with even more ammo. Donna is never gonna do her job, that much is clear to anyone that's worked with her. The following scene unfolds:

The safety manager, the shop manager, and Donna's direct supervisor are all in the HR office. They call me in. HR is claiming this is ""the first I've heard about this, so all I can do is recommend retraining."" Followed by the safety manager, the shop manager, the supervisor, and me all telling HR that is not the first case, we've all seen multiple cases, she's been written up multiple times. HR felt that because I was gathering evidence against her in secret it was unfair to Donna. That was how we all left the office. But that's not how the story ended. The safety manager assured me this would not stand, and in the end he got his way. What I had provided was nothing less than repeated cases of document fraud. While HR wouldn't budge they at least suspended Donna pending a decision. I honestly thought she was going to come back because nothing seemed like enough. That was until just recently I was waiting to see HR and Donna came storming out of the office and called me an asshole on the way out. And that was it, Donna was gone. 

Something a co-worker said about her seems fitting. Of course she would call me an asshole rather than blame herself for never doing her job. Lots of people warned her, she kept fucking off anyways. If there is still more interest I could do a part 5 with an abundance of Donna-moments. Like holy shit, there are a lot. Hilarious woman.",2020-06-16 22:16:34
Comment,5,fv1eupu,,0,1592332052.0,"**Part 3 - Becoming the snitch**

In any kind of blue collar job, there's a strong culture of dealing with problematic co-workers directly instead of reporting people to supervisors behind their back. That kind of shit will not make you popular. The most I had done regarding outting Donna to my supervisor was say that I didn't want to finish inspections she started because I ""didn't trust the quality of her work."" Well one fateful morning the shop manager came walking up to me and said ""You better watch out, that little shit Donna is snitching on you now. What's her problem? I told her you can take your lunch break whenever you want and not to make it her business."" The way he spoke with such contempt for her was quite telling. All her lies and bullshit wasn't making her anyone's favorite, but now with the snitching...

I was taking a lunch break in the employee cafe, and I had Donna's number blocked. She called me at 5am about something for the last time. Poor Donna could not call me for 'help' so she called the shop manager and apparently told him that I was taking my lunch break early, hadn't been working, and that she thinks I check off inspections while sitting in the employee cafe. Yup, Donna's a real piece of shit. A week later a different supervisor tells me to watch my back, saying he was with the shop manager when he got a call from Donna and tells me the exact same story with her accusing me of bullshitting inspections while sitting in the cafe. So I have two people telling me the same story. I'm not the sort of person to be openly hostile towards anyone, because ultimately doing so does not gain me anything. But with snitching Donna had crossed the line, to say nothing of the shear audacity of someone that doesn't do their job at all snitching on me a thoroughly honest worker.

This should be the point where the story wraps up, but actually we are very far from it. The number of times I reported Donna for blatantly not doing her job and nothing happened could fill another 3 posts. She would drive to a cargo area and sleep in her truck for an hour, then go take a lunch break. She became wary of bullshitting inspections when I was also present on the AOA, which led to days where she would not do any inspections for the last 4 hours of her shift when I'm around. And I would tell my supervisor, again and again. He wrote her up twice but nothing really happened. I was unapologetic at this point, why would I NOT snitch her when she's sitting on her ass for hours leaving more work for me to finish. I gave up when I realized that constantly outting her for everything just made my supervisor used to what he may see as a 'rivalry.' From them on I reserved my snitching for truly egregious shit.

So when I came back from a vacation and found contaminated samples in several units because clearly someone wasn't doing their job, I made sure my supervisor knew. I think they didn't care as much so long as someone signed off on the inspections, if they weren't actually doing the checks then the management could feign ignorance and blame the person who signed the forms. Which is why I wanted to make sure they did know, so if a plane fell out of the sky they couldn't say ""we had no idea our technician wasn't doing their job until now.""

Time passed. First signs of the virus came, flights were starting to really slow down. One day Donna asked to get lunch with me. I really didn't want to but eh whatever, it's a slow day. We ate lunch. After lunch she gets in her truck and I am walking several gates over to where I parked. I see Donna drive off. When I get back to my truck I check the inspections and find 3 have been completed. Funny, Donna and I are the only ones doing inspections so how did 3 get done while we were both eating? I find the 3 that were finished, she just did them all a minute prior while I was walking to my truck. Now think about this from Donna's perspective: she wants to bullshit the inspections, but she is probably afraid of checking everything off when I might be doing an actual inspection on that unit and notice. Perhaps she thought it was safe to bullshit some inspections when she could see me walking back to my truck. This was really it for me though, there's just no reason to bullshit. Plenty of other people I work with that do more or less an honest job, certainly never shit like this. We had a lot of day left to finish the inspections, and it's not hard to do them. Plus the supervisors understood that it was better to have incomplete but honest information.",2020-06-16 21:27:32
Comment,6,fv17wha,,0,1592328829.0,"**Part 2 - Not the Cleverest Liar**

Donna liked to lie, and the thing about lying in the workplace is no matter how clever you are eventually people are going to figure you out. She wasn't the best liar though, and really she just had one particular lie she liked to tell. When caught doing something wrong or, really just not doing anything, she would say so-and-so told her (a lie.) Why were those safety seals missing on the audit? ""Oh Jeff said he was going to test the override so I left the seal off."" 

The lie that really topped them all was when her supervisor reminded her that he does want her to start actually fixing stuff like everyone else with her job title does. Donna told her supervisor that the general manager had said she ""doesn't have to do any of that stuff."" This supervisor was a real no-bullshit hardass and immediately called Donna on that lie, saying he would be happy to call the general manager right now and ask the general manager why he was telling one of his employees not to do her job. Donna was caught in that one.

For most of us we were happy to have Donna not doing anything because when she tried to do something it would be a catastrophe. The incident that really made me keen to her bullshit was shortly after she was released to work on her own. She needed to drain some fuel out of a recovery tank but didn't know how to use the pump, so 2 mechanics came and helped her. As the mechanics tell it, they then waved and drove off to respond to a call. I came around later and found Donna throwing spill kits on the ground around a large fuel spill. Her version of the story was that 2 mechanics were draining the fuel for her and left it running and caused a spill. That didn't really sound right to me, why would they be draining recovery tank from the truck you are driving? Turns out after the mechanics got the pump started she just walked off and ate lunch, letting the barrel she was draining into overflow. Stupid mistake, but the real takeaway for me and both those mechanics was that she tried to blame them for her fuckup. We'd see a lot more of that in time to come.

One of the mundane duties of our job is making sure all fire extinguishers are up to date. Most auditors aren't going to spot a rusted solenoid causing high run-off, but they for sure will catch you on expired/discharged fire extinguishers. For the first 2 months Donna did not do this despite me reminding her. On the 3rd month I spot-checked 3 units she already inspected, saw that she hadn't checked the fire extinguishers on any them. I sent Donna a text reminding her to *please* make sure she checks and replaces fire extinguishers today. Donna responded saying ""Oh I know, I already am."" I was fuming already, but what really got me into a fervor was seeing her later that day. She drove up to a unit, asked the guy using the unit what his readings were today and then drove off. She never did the inspection, never even left her vehicle, and was still ignoring the goddamn fire extinguishers. 

I'd talked about outting Donna for a long time. My co-workers always talked me down. ""Sooner or later time will catch up with her, don't worry about it."" Well the fire marshall was re-certifying our units and found a unit with an expired fire extinguisher, no big deal my supervisor just asked me to go replace it. I asked my supervisor if he could check who performed the inspection for the unit with an expired extinguisher and missed that on the 1st of the month. Of course it was Donna, and I guess my supervisor said something to Donna because on the 4th month she started checking fire extinguishers. This was a disaster. Like actually hilarious how badly she managed to fuck up something as simple as checking the placard on a fire extinguisher and punching a hole on the tag for that month if it's good. She didn't actually check if the extinguishers were expired. Multiple expired/discharged extinguishers that she had punched the hole on. So not doing her job at all, just punching the holes to make it look like it's done. But even just punching the holes on the tags she couldn't do right, she punched the wrong holes on most of them. I had to stay and replace all the tags and unfuck what she did. This left me with a massive stack of fire extinguisher inspection tags that looked like a meth addict had haphazardly punched holes in them, I left them on my supervisor's desk with no explanation.",2020-06-16 20:33:49

&#x200B;

As someone in your industry, be careful because I've seen a lot of people being terminated for no valid reason. Sometimes it's personal vendetta, abuse of power or some other obscure reason. The client complaining had nothing to do with it and neither did your performance. 

&#x200B;

You need to be extremely careful at work. If you do your job extremely well like you did you risk being loaded with even more work first of all and second of all someone else potentially your team leader/manager may feel threatened. Do not,  I repeat do not make the mistake of coming in on a weekend ever. Been there done that no one said thanks. Work your contracted hours only. Focus on networking outside your company so you always have a second shot somewhere else if things go bad. 

&#x200B;

Fun fact 4 companies ago we had a new MD replace the old MD and this guy started firing directors left and right due to ""poor performance"". I know this as I had full overview of all sensitive data so I knew they did not just leave by their own accord. He started bringing in his friends from his old company soon after that. So the lesson is people can get fired ""just because"" and you should never ever be loyal to your company. Your coworkers are not your friends and be very careful what you say about yourself.
